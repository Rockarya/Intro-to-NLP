resumption of the session    2.5077205603491106
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday 17 december 1999 , and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period .    3.3052297811825126
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days , during this part - session .    3.514086686250332
in the meantime , i should like to observe a minute ' s silence , as a number of members have requested , on behalf of all the victims concerned , particularly those of the terrible storms , in the various countries of the european union .    4.19951735122551
please rise , then , for this minute ' s silence .    4.130317930816119
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )    1.9386441451792231
madam president , on a point of order .    2.0707826220316585
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb UNK and killings in sri lanka .    3.6355510822225647
one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr UNK UNK , who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago .    3.8832983930318665
would it be appropriate for you , madam president , to write a letter to the sri UNK president expressing parliament ' s regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation ?    3.8125300038145262
yes , mr evans , i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate .    4.002231640889821
if the house agrees , i shall do as mr evans has suggested .    3.572950273842854
madam president , on a point of order .    2.0707826220316585
i would like your advice about rule UNK concerning UNK .    2.9343113878423224
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again .    3.755965309691034
the UNK report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .    3.244272194378456
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability .    3.753353935968426
i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report , not a legislative proposal , and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday .    4.188080470667211
that is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i . e . on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .    3.963969070881661
madam president , coinciding with this year ' s first part - session of the european parliament , a date has been set , unfortunately for next thursday , in texas in america , for the execution of a young 34 year - old man who has been sentenced to death . we shall call him mr UNK .    3.590475842496031
however , i would ask you , in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community , to make representations , using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent , to the president and to the governor of texas , mr UNK , who has the power to order a stay of execution and to UNK the condemned person .    4.495170517479087
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld .    4.005217496508489
thank you , mr UNK , i shall do so UNK .    3.1544956486721256
indeed , it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted .    3.5405906460530976
madam president , i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest .    3.319179153730091
it is the case of alexander nikitin .    3.396872476995099
all of us here are pleased that the courts have UNK him and made it clear that in russia , too , access to environmental information is a constitutional right .    3.835533970178697
now , however , he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is UNK .    4.505309178406993
we know , and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed , including specifically during the last plenary part - session of last year , that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings .    3.851789307157272
yes , mrs schroedter , i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter .    4.054984957410518
madam president , i would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that , during this first part - session of the new year , the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably .    4.146045980048497
but , madam president , my personal request has not been met .    4.309636494813925
although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one , there is still no dutch channel , which is what i had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month .    3.7011360556073134
i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well .    3.8871029895904976
mrs plooij - van gorsel , i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors ' meeting on wednesday .    3.3291240326835547
it will , i hope , be examined in a positive light .    3.5754577212452223
madam president , can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes ?    3.455380877740045
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected ?    3.2407323219722923
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 ?    2.7717047334771485
why has there been no fire UNK , either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings ?    2.788223194092754
why are there no fire instructions ?    3.1525021308536814
why have the UNK not been improved since my accident ?    3.7307536410413604
why are no - smoking areas not enforced ?    3.070390118436325
it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves .    3.3151064387767555
mrs lynne , you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done .    3.9549359139050724
i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors , and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on .    3.9187347041076297
madam president , mrs díez gonzález and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vice - president , mrs de palacio , which appeared in a spanish newspaper .    3.2063472248176947
the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part - session .    3.6180224399502956
i would ask that they reconsider , since this is not the case .    3.1343922720384465
the questions answered previously referred to mrs de palacio ' s intervention , on another occasion , and not to these comments which appeared in the UNK newspaper on 18 november .    3.6278802117560454
mr berenguer UNK , we shall check all this .    4.503545506443657
i admit that , at present , the matter seems to be somewhat confused .    4.2706512598686714
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be .    3.9503583992192874
madam president , i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our UNK over today ' s decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past ?    3.6525435158529582
today ' s decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there .    3.1954730125590207
so parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .    3.9875767713552173
it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo .    3.8526225063745714
as people have said , the situation there is extremely UNK .    4.765013389305047
there is , in fact , a risk of a military coup in the future .    3.25390996962423
we do not know what is happening .    2.798109916212213
so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people ?    3.076126216475241
in any event , this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday .    2.809024716172729
agenda    3.515252916915767
the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of 13 january pursuant to rule 110 of the rules of procedure .    2.2886584605098657
no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday .    3.567162704755193
relating to wednesday :    3.1680092092393637
the group of the party of european socialists requests that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission .    2.999053805563051
i would like mr barón crespo , who made the request , to speak to propose it . that is , if he so wishes , of course .    4.081749566851657
then we shall follow the usual procedure , hearing one speaker in favour and one against .    2.458068716795467
madam president , the presentation of the prodi commission ' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the group of the party of european socialists which was unanimously approved by the conference of presidents in september and which was also explicitly accepted by president prodi , who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech .    3.5031871146412863
this commitment is important because the commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the treaties and , therefore , basically dictates this parliament ' s political and legislative activity for the next five years .    4.1853307521244805
i would also like to point out , madam president , that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature . it did so again during this legislature , in july , and then , in september , it voted once more to approve the whole commission .    3.773145901630918
there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens .    4.333227639338087
to this end , i would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 september , which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible .    3.0213475578380544
the events of last week - which UNK outside the conference of presidents , that conference being used simply to UNK and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma . either the commission is not ready to present this programme , in which case it should clarify it .    3.5949697180730116
according to its president , it is in a position to do so .    3.410198660563983
given that the commission is represented by vice - president de palacio , i believe that , before voting , it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme , as agreed . alternatively , parliament is not ready to examine this programme , as some appear to be suggesting .    4.53469469576971
in my opinion , this second hypothesis would imply the failure of parliament in its duty as a parliament , as well as introducing an original UNK , an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware , in writing , of a speech concerning the commission ' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier , as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in february , so we could UNK the debate , since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the internet and parliament will no longer have to worry about it .    3.9856576696623534
therefore , the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists , and which you have mentioned , is that the prodi commission present its legislative programme on wednesday , including its proposed administrative reform , because , otherwise , we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation : on the pretext that there is no text , on the one hand , the president of the commission would be denied his right to speak in this parliament and , on the other hand , there would be a debate on a reform when parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based .    4.2563515963629746
therefore , madam president , i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote .    3.786409427890826
( applause from the pse group )    2.2339401374085748
madam president , i would like to make it very clear that , above all , the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this parliament and , amongst those , the decision establishing its agenda .    3.834714040282047
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide .    2.9837112560719063
but i would also like to make it very clear that president prodi made a commitment to this parliament to introduce a new debate , as mr barón crespo has reminded us , which would be in addition to the annual debate on the commission ' s legislative programme , on the broad areas of action for the next five years , that is to say , for this legislature .    4.4244806293378485
madam president , i would like to say that the agreement reached in september distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the commission ' s legislative programme .    3.234516369733285
i would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally , on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups .    4.080109912173158
therefore , madam president , i would like to repeat that the commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and , when parliament decides , - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and , next month , the programme for 2000 , which is what we fully agreed upon .    4.270976362141326
i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be UNK .    3.514461908278309
( parliament rejected the request ) president .    2.493403220390376
still on the subject of wednesday ' s sitting , i have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax .    3.9576340853910157
the ppe - de group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda .    3.047674095703048
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this ?    2.84103557076519
madam president , i can hear a UNK of UNK from the socialists . i was told that large sections of the socialist group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda , because at the vote in the conference of presidents no vote was received from the working group of members of the socialist group responsible for this matter .    4.126680994090929
i do not know whether this information is correct , but the ppe - de group would , in any case , be grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already .    3.3960761619138435
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .    3.6935598610102205
thank you , mr poettering .    2.4495975917224038
we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request .    2.850903786323257
madam president , i would firstly like to point out mr poettering ' s lack of logic .    2.679763199183204
he has just been preaching to the group of the party of european socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the conference of presidents , and now he is doing just the same .    3.147011297349253
we discussed that matter and we were unanimous , with the exception of the ppe and eldr groups . as my fellow chairmen will recall , i even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the tobin tax , but of whether one dared to hear what the commission and the council thought of it .    4.045619668066504
it is not a lot to ask .    3.423560771869181
i therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the commission and the council should be retained so that we can find out , once and for all , the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion , particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the seattle conference .    3.7852550821039896
we shall proceed to vote on the ppe - de group ' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda .    3.2917487850308977
( parliament rejected the request , with 164 votes for , UNK votes against and 7 abstentions )    2.747819841289032
madam president , i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate .    2.4203433115554014
thank you very much .    2.4004302117423095
madam president , has my vote been counted ? i was unable to vote UNK , since i do not have a card .    3.436168270299239
my vote was " in favour " .    3.433363638020073
indeed , if we add the two members who have declared themselves , then the result of the vote would be .    4.030804431855521
madam president , the presidency has already declared the result of the vote .    3.640733765248632
there is no room for amendments .    3.1156316999871665
that did not happen .    3.546353430162502
i would appreciate it if , on the close of this item of business , i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group .    4.017566169183502
this is an important matter .    2.567421334442018
it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis .    4.270328317217669
madam president , i do not wish to reopen the debate , but i had also asked for the floor , to comment on mr barón crespo ' s motion .    3.7751594573449663
you did not call me either .    3.1012573150186915
i regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .    4.142001185238522
i am terribly sorry , mr hänsch and mr cox . i did not see you asking to speak .    3.391358661809829
even so , i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes .    3.976977103911341
when we adopt the minutes for today ' s sitting tomorrow , then any members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments .    3.72240853227909
this seems to me to be a workable solution .    3.493667963564181
i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time - consuming explanations of votes .    3.2024746279126566
mr cox , mr hänsch , would this be acceptable to you ?    3.5825895933179512
madam president , if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not , and cannot , object to that .    3.381357196887764
if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote , i accept that but with reservations .    3.672903134541443
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes , as we always do , of course .    4.425633911748215
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted , then we may correct them , if necessary .    3.702152657619572
safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods    3.6582360072371998
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0105 / 1999 ) by mr koch , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterways ( c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1998 / UNK ( cod ) .    2.0462233602636863
firstly , we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of directive 96 / 35 / ec , which obliges the member states to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training , UNK and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly .    3.7061444935514443
secondly , by adopting this directive we achieve a ) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and UNK ; b ) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c ) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the european labour market .    3.385615598104096
thirdly , this directive , as it currently stands in the common position , guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union ; by adopting it we contribute to the member states ' bearing a high level of individual responsibility .    3.9139566033774074
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed .    3.9852455555199513
our amendments from the first reading have , i believe , been taken into account very satisfactorily .    4.861027362160841
they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance , or they have been rejected because the corresponding european arrangements have not been included , for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions .    3.9576540369221753
the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport , which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive , is something which i would urge you to support .    4.4416927930717485
by not setting a specific date for the member states to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force , we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay .    4.214991143185653
i would urge you to endorse this .    2.761801387933406
madam president , we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads , but also on our railways and waterways , not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster .    3.7033724376746915
as an austrian , i still have a vivid memory , as , i believe , we all do , of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the UNK tunnel , where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense .    3.7937082474119515
the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit .    3.961339641077527
in fact , all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province .    2.8180098290405073
prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well - trained safety advisers being available , so that the right action is taken in good time .    4.276064119970074
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .    4.214595608937728
i should like to address one final point . we must not content ourselves with UNK another hole in the safety net and UNK our eyes to the fact that , where transport safety in europe is concerned , there is still much more to be done .    4.025011999502609
in this context , i should like to make a request and ask the commissioner responsible , who is with us here today , to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future , so that we in europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale .    4.296368443249462
madam president , first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .    3.9983782068288973
the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland waterway .    2.9873023646299863
i congratulate him on his excellent report .    2.734441917163484
transport safety has sadly been in the news recently : the paddington rail crash in london , the terrible rail crash in norway , the two UNK UNK involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified .    3.190335834632328
the rapporteur has pointed out to the house that in its common position the council has accepted six of parliament ' s ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of parliament ' s other amendments has been retained .    4.91192878805073
when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety .    2.952871599900906
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved .    4.192720207459441
madam president , i would like to make a few comments .    2.277789925097348
i would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the commission for the proposal it has submitted .    4.199679070450467
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also , in fact , with minimum requirements .    3.2995239811579182
needless to say , safety on roads , railways and inland waterways is of key importance and , given the international nature of these types of transport , training for safety advisors should also be harmonised , therefore , as well as the requirements of the new adr , for example , which is under way .    4.045787151371931
this is important , but so is enforcement and there are , of course , a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this .    4.243378941344763
just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years , for example in belgium , the netherlands and a number of other countries where UNK carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in UNK conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead .    3.8025981925322374
or ships from eastern europe which UNK adjacent to ships over here , with all the obvious risks that this entails .    3.295639059674556
furthermore , it has UNK that research in the ports in belgium , finland , but also in japan has shown that 50 % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for UNK .    3.717321784876395
in short , the issue is an important one .    3.7901405032377
if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned , in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 january of this year .    3.597200787080614
there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present , especially with smaller companies , as these cannot afford safety advisors .    3.592735520206653
these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo , which causes problems .    2.893544611291595
it is therefore also being requested that UNK UNK certificates possibly include the UNK details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses .    3.3024065837784784
the work is done . all that remains is the business of enforcement .    3.702612948355751
i would like to mention one final point .    2.6995535716239107
with regard to enforcement , proper agreements must also be concluded with the eastern european countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 july 2001 , that is to say in eighteen months ' time .    3.6781627414041753
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period .    3.0637385535250385
this is not in itself anything dreadful , but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road , rail and inland waterways and incorporate these , as part of the acquis communautaire , as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states .    3.2881311593536533
madam president , the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so .    3.845506671843217
the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks , known and unknown , for employees and the social environment .    3.2237719638694737
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .    3.6534885207805217
the relevant standards which have been laid down in another directive , 95 / 35 / ec , seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods .    3.310441354311477
i am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the council on minimum standards regarding examinations , although i would have preferred it if uniform , set standards and UNK had been established , so that certificates would be of equal value internationally .    3.5576723046125793
this , however , does not seem feasible .    3.5245831085738453
finally , the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can , therefore , give it my wholehearted support .    3.788196815375885
mr president , commissioner , i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports which , though technical , are nonetheless of very great significance for safety .    2.858827651560339
i should like to make just a few comments .    3.196765641889253
firstly , i should like to ask the commissioner - and i am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety , be it on the roads , on the waterways or at sea .    4.123097776550943
considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on 19 march 1998 , even though parliament responded relatively quickly , this time lag is a little too long .    4.356337003010113
this is not just the fault of the commission , but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well .    4.167042405563824
my second point has already been mentioned : it concerns the minimum standards .    3.2728674387945924
in principle , i believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country - specific rules .    4.215390704505904
however , when it comes to safety , i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in germany , italy or austria .    3.7185646186094603
i can live with these minimum standards , but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully .    4.037860134911556
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation .    4.023409717263277
my third point has also been mentioned already .    3.1909965518214762
as you know , like mr rack , i come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .    3.2039543404226016
we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries .    3.562590164973349
but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum , in all countries , whether they are transit countries or not .    3.8826789709756953
mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr koch , on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal ; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the UNK examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road , rail or inland waterway .    3.1926153902806793
we understand that it is important that the two institutions - parliament and commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy , and in particular the transport group , is magnificent .    4.360296399540272
the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the commission and UNK the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and , at second reading , we can accept the amendment on the proposed date , which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the commission , bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question .    4.653081513308772
very briefly , i would like to thank the various members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the commission ' s priorities in the field of transport .    4.255765142653482
as mr UNK has said very correctly , this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end .    3.744883600553756
the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day .    3.5836544129530488
in this regard , i would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels , which messrs rack and swoboda have referred to , which , in the case of austria , is doubtless a very sensitive issue , and great effort should be made to improve their safety .    3.7371803049788044
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently , the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves .    3.767127473228678
UNK and a few kilos of paint which , in principle , do not present risks , led to a genuine disaster .    4.140033082233552
therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .    3.6756320367767925
finally , i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport .    3.2028629270372733
this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport , in light of the erika disaster , and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport .    4.502056021444304
but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission .    3.6652249506646184
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur , mr koch .    3.5507614744045637
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
transport of dangerous goods by road    3.6283073892855575
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0104 / 1999 ) by mr koch , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 94 / 55 / ec on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [ com ( 1999 ) 158 - c5 - 0004 / 1999 - 1999 / 0083 ( cod ) ] .    1.9661347986502995
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road , which entered into force on 1 january 1997 , contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time , the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen , that is the european committee for standardisation .    2.9093183585107156
delays in the cen ' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive .    4.4688110645934715
in particular , annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments .    3.5229642442029374
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .    4.069520324645729
in this respect , i accept this proposal to amend directive 94 / 55 / ec which has been tabled for discussion today .    3.124925818859031
should the european union fail to take action , then member states would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period , until the cen UNK its work , which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty .    4.632023895503589
the amendment to the directive on today ' s agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community .    3.2295177385411207
it merely UNK transitional rules by postponing deadlines , deletes provisions which are no longer applicable , and lays down the procedures for a ) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b ) enacting less stringent national regulations , in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas .    3.3278402040541093
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity ; the member states obtain more powers .    3.991172413133406
the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own . in so doing , it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure .    3.967149192547781
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down UNK in the council decision of june 1999 .    3.9083003757962587
the proposal to be discussed today , to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road , dates from may 1999 , however , and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure .    3.4067533539122943
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .    4.009408379724646
we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the council has to make a decision - which is not clearly worded - is set at a maximum of three months .    4.658472238666073
in addition , the need for greater transparency has been pointed out .    3.16083444529673
a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below - 20ºc . this is in the special interest of northern european regions .    3.815614252284762
a final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between 1 january 1997 and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it .    4.27940511607959
i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety , but i would ask you to endorse this report .    3.8438114728453754
mr president , colleagues , a happy new year and millennium to you all .    3.1332639451655124
i am speaking for the first time in this plenary part - session , so this is quite exciting for me , a little like first love , although that did last longer than two minutes .    3.5378714564943152
i would like to briefly comment on the commission ' s proposal to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road .    2.7218015588893043
it is good that this directive should be established now , as , otherwise , member states would have to amend their national acts for a very short time , a period of transition , which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to eu bureaucracy .    4.311527530203376
the commission ' s proposal , however , does not take account of all the facts , such as the cold climate that prevails in the northern regions .    3.9343434682847245
consequently , i have tabled some amendments to mr koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .    3.687035753910136
my amendments concern the frost - resistance UNK for tankers carrying these dangerous goods .    3.0779197318854705
according to the commission ' s proposal - 20ºc would have been sufficient . on the shores of the mediterranean , it is hard to imagine that in lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that .    3.7938159648957788
i have thus proposed that the frost rating be UNK to - UNK .    3.3806328826586336
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously .    3.3999103710671417
i hope my proposal will be taken into consideration in tomorrow ' s vote .    3.199791796481451
mr president , with your permission i should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the UNK just now during the debate .    3.309485253602117
i thought that it was quite superb .    3.6280091817268953
on the subject at hand , i think that the people of europe must be able to be confident that the goods - however dangerous they are - which are transported on europe ' s roads , railways , and so on are as safe as possible .    3.8293142164273832
this directive is a contribution to this .    3.305018254487226
what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance .    3.170679779706741
the rapporteur , mr koch , to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this , has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the UNK on the part of the cen , which has been very UNK in drawing up and adapting the directive .    4.339466047357422
that is why we can only hope - and we should resolve all of this this week - that , in 2001 , we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer .    4.57753164778166
mr president , the report we are discussing here does not , in itself , entail any major changes .    3.4959461209381213
most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature .    3.5365227589003974
it is nonetheless worth emphasising that , each time we make this type of decision , it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market .    3.7532143718974154
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu , both on roads and railways and by sea .    3.8995879027472995
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind .    3.106139103472925
in area after area , we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states .    4.011461050408926
this is extraordinarily positive , and there is cause to thank the rapporteur , mr koch , for the work he has put in on this issue .    3.903177711235567
this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned .    3.76000232583405
if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running , it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also , as far as possible , apply to every country .    3.7404689222492284
i should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance , namely an amendment tabled by member of parliament , mr UNK vatanen .    3.8271897610655694
in many ways , the prerequisites differ from one member state to another .    2.7732283272954574
by approving this amendment , we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union .    4.063648967427995
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind .    3.128333505964756
it is good that , in establishing the present regulations , we can also be flexible .    4.2726776194625185
mr president , i would like to thank not only mr koch , but also the vice - president of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority .    3.804568209498841
the reason mr koch produced his sound report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously .    3.605223741300928
i would like to ask the vice - president if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations , and whether the eu is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts , in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible .    3.8646393430606434
for one thing is clear : even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union , traffic does not stop at our borders , it goes beyond them .    4.405726979933984
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far - reaching regional provisions .    3.424641381369443
if the commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at ?    3.7335825766440207
mr president , i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report , which in a way supplements the debate which we held in october on rail transport .    3.387064448424971
we all regret that the european committee for standardisation ( cen ) has not been able , in the required time , to carry out the amendment of the provisions necessary for the required harmonisation within the european union .    4.054413695997401
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours .    3.7378740215483193
a moment ago , mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures , not of 20 degrees below zero , but of 40 degrees below zero .    3.3447700745170104
of course , we accept that amendment - it is absolutely right - and i believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union , which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and UNK of a technical nature .    4.456286534541703
i would like to say , with regard to mr swoboda ' s comments on the activity of the cen , that we are urging them to speed up their work as much as possible because it would be terrible if , despite the new deadline , we were to find ourselves after a year and a bit with the same difficulties because their work has not been concluded .    4.255546192176328
lastly , mr president , the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out . we have referred to the delay by the cen , the amendment of certain provisions , the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific .    4.708901391873003
the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur , mr koch , which are contained in the various amendments , specifically four .    4.535534152956742
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed .    3.6689566851448787
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.5924185258399082
structural funds - cohesion fund coordination    3.9753706161579596
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0108 / 1999 ) by mrs schroedter , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the communication from the commission in the field of the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund : guidelines for programmes in the period 2000 - 2006 [ com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0122 / 1999 - 1999 / 2127 ( cos ) ] .    1.992950916722592
mr president , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the united kingdom that i represent in this parliament , namely wales .    4.588059695629962
it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face .    3.891297615525612
we have seen poverty growing in wales ; and growing still further since 1997 .    2.9066797308231664
we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen .    2.797161861145581
we are looking , therefore , within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the UNK .    5.2359734565812825
what is , however , deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been , in a sense , a success of the government . it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces .    4.655328536464486
that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront .    4.779947621690005
we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality .    5.089846956022504
we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures .    4.259804165084508
we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects .    4.566903469969598
we look to it to challenge the uk government , to ensure that the private sector , which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural funds expenditure , is involved in the planning stage .    3.5202669309120322
finally , we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent .    3.8282925241530323
too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent .    4.333606643985906
mr president , our committee views these issues very differently and , to start , i will speak from the point of view of research .    3.6302212199475434
we see it as a very positive sign that , in her own conclusions , the rapporteur has taken account of our committee ' s proposal that the cohesion fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by UNK universities and UNK in such a way that they would serve those who live in UNK regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts .    3.911098152950594
this will be possible with action on the part of governments , and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development .    3.7343641020474183
another matter we would like to address , specifically from the point of view of industrial policy , is that we would have liked the commission to pay more attention to the effects of services , electronic commerce and the growing use of the internet , when they were planning the coordination of structural funds and cohesion funds .    4.7075953743296495
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood .    3.204408108463069
the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry , but today those areas might have become a burden , and they may well be poor , meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production , as i might call it , and the production of services , because they are the industries of the future .    4.165334922359794
in my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this , so on behalf of the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy , i would draw the commission ' s attention to this issue .    3.7079371018417495
mr president , i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague , mrs flautre , who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill .    3.316609303900994
i would like to draw people ' s attention to amendments nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but not accepted by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .    3.047270735880393
these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion .    3.731294810843897
in the past , this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment .    3.8899429492735935
these amendments also fit in with this parliament ' s view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action .    3.8750895437540005
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment .    3.1555482878744803
in her report , mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is UNK lacking , yet desperately needed .    3.2344246423790546
the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund .    4.09760160410187
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme .    3.838613606631773
it could be said that the omission gives the impression that the commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between european social fund assistance , which is subject to review after three and a half years , and the member states ' annual national plans for employment .    4.185701106714874
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an UNK which is now being dealt with constructively .    4.64701661704871
mr president , commissioner , the proposal presented by the commission , in accordance with its mandate , is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development .    3.428217495482785
i would like to point out , however , that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us : maintaining a population in rural areas , given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture ' s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society .    3.3261300065756414
this , as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment , which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity , UNK the UNK from rural areas .    3.5347766514999903
the consequences do not inspire hope .    3.078168282858864
it is the young people who are disappearing , who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas , all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas .    3.880420730584869
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs .    4.269287668303404
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union .    2.531572203337849
agriculture only provides 5 . 5 % of employment in the union .    3.54307361756972
for this reason , one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the european union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas , outside of the agricultural sector , in sectors such as rural tourism , sport , culture , heritage conservation , the conversion of businesses , new technologies , services , etc . however , even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive , it is still essential , not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of UNK towns , but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land , in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment .    4.142176138934885
therefore , we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set . we want rural areas , at the dawn of the 21st century , to be competitive and multi - functional , both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non - agricultural activities .    4.526397465841622
it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium , and to bear in mind the conclusions of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the five fundamental issues , which have been only partly taken up by the committee on transport , regional policy and tourism in its points 16 and 17 .    3.761184739678021
in conclusion , i would ask the commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because i believe that , for the european union , maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives .    4.228997187275182
mr president , commissioner , i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter , the rapporteur , for her work .    2.7257866053850934
i think that this work has been carried out extremely well .    2.985757240816337
i would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments - and perhaps there are more of them than we expected - but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing .    3.729200333299618
we feel that it is important that the commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this parliament , at least in spirit , because at this stage , it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise , and nothing but hot air .    3.9493901720535236
the truth of the matter though is that we believe - and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted - that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament , particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives .    5.21955290209657
in our amendments , we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the structural funds , the cohesion fund and community initiatives , so that their application should be reflected , in the best and most profitable way , by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are , when all is said and done , the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing .    4.327015697765057
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives , we think that those who generate employment , the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment , that is , businesspeople , must participate in this initiative .    3.9436064454386255
small and medium - sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .    3.998535507138144
if they do not , if businesspeople feel marginalised , if entrepreneurs cannot take part , not only in managing but also in receiving these funds , we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly .    3.9900919888649344
also , in order to attain our objectives , to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment , it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies , to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies .    3.856109961458641
all of this must be done - i repeat - with the participation of private business , which , by UNK its efforts with those of public administrations , but UNK them , never obstructing or excluding them , will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs .    3.969285173355476
mr president , it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague , mr evans , of why wales actually achieved objective 1 status .    3.2253543429874534
it was because of the UNK policies of his own conservative party .    3.7867015073894046
let me also remind him that when his party leader , mr hague , was secretary of state for wales , he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a UNK letter from commissioner wulf - mathies regarding regulatory requirements .    3.108995709512654
i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective 1 additionality .    3.170287372059695
i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation .    3.0906206371420617
my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .    2.8400158730302074
the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration , to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life - support machine .    3.8193791083596875
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi - tech sector .    3.0211404509966866
it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the hi - tech growth industries of the future .    3.1810581858305373
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about .    4.062641312827197
they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape .    2.828735911251425
they should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development , resulting in inevitable delays and UNK , particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement .    3.5752778958793505
the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer , either in the commission or in the civil service .    4.582710906453764
there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate , while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes .    3.4379924633329435
the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad , indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund - users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration .    3.5127904191377466
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report . she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report .    3.3991380079791957
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines .    3.032718458008454
we are badly behind now in this matter .    2.9936173182727552
hopefully , the stands parliament has taken will help , however , in the mid - term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation .    4.449971208518789
for the time , the report grew too large when it was being debated .    4.2642844727869695
it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports .    3.291075566942767
at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy , bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality .    3.9307691224646293
our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity , the responsibility of member states and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes .    3.6468258328725796
it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes .    2.5807777409757144
our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas .    2.604831734589001
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes .    3.916310033335999
projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes .    3.536300231487475
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned .    4.1555196397046865
projects have to be carried out more efficiently , more flexibly and they have to be made more productive .    4.396652959085863
while the report was being prepared , it was interesting to discuss the union ' s regional policy in general .    4.39901524580672
for us new members , it was the first time , and this was a very interesting process .    4.542534792502675
this report is very good and our group supports it .    3.482564954137254
mr president , commissioner , as proof that this parliament has not yet overcome its role as a consultative and subordinate institution , the excellent report by a fellow member of my group , UNK schroedter , has not been able to reach plenary sitting because the plans for regional development for the period 2000 - 2006 for objective 1 regions have been sitting in the commission ' s offices for several months .    3.4096348229188655
bearing this in mind , this house should , in any event , demand that , before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved , they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament , specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today .    4.662051128345351
this is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least - developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fairer europe .    3.8496959198865595
mr president , we should not forget that the main , strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion .    3.5629834296292615
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results .    3.6117963010615113
we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a europe of citizens and not just in a europe of states and of regions .    5.079389646123806
we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion .    3.1834435278948576
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole UNK .    2.858937159524198
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population .    3.3915492710377366
we will have to study several indicators , which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others , and how they are evolving .    3.8748460565335208
it is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to parliament ' s plenary sitting today that europe ' s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions .    3.9744368032185573
this fact means that the european parliament , the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically .    4.851152608629198
i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .    5.430859085189586
i do not think , however , that this report has come too late .    3.6361126528888423
we need to consider it together , so that the new objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development , which have been drafted before the directives come into force , can be submitted for revision and proper assessment .    4.140826730003271
we all agree that we should ask that , halfway through these programmes , when the assessment of the directives is made , parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens ' representatives .    4.636607132810304
our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is , at least on the face of it , bureaucratic .    5.056351220461228
they need to see the political dimension working , to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens .    4.794722204919768
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for .    3.732327382206007
i would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional president , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .    4.376850553196676
mr president , i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period 2000 - 2006 and the main recommendations of the report which include the following : there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of eu structural and cohesion funds .    3.664559509195648
this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent .    4.480838398502281
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for UNK relations between towns and rural areas .    2.9833680895980033
this latter point is of particular importance .    3.2160625910886225
while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city UNK .    3.656802318315484
we do not want to build a europe of cities alone .    3.1583092315032664
the structural funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries , mainly through the upgrading of roads , water treatment and related transport networks .    3.1439537592286655
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year , which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary part - session .    3.7137906368789
key eu programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 1 regions within europe .    3.2289515522414125
the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date . this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the UNK regions , the poorer regions in europe , are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone , as well as within an ever - expanding internal market where the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital exist .    3.7709523820459223
in conclusion , while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the european regional development fund and the cohesion fund , we should remember that the european social fund has played a very important role in helping the less well - off in our society .    4.02753247758343
the social fund has certainly improved our third - level institutions , financed our post - leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long - term unemployment , assist early school UNK and promote higher standards of UNK UNK .    2.9468580449330113
mr president , on numerous occasions in the past i have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues . this time , however , i actually agree with her .    3.837590846178368
whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path , i cannot say . nevertheless , i would like to commend her on her work .    3.5599693241390926
the second point i would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex , as we and mrs mccarthy , as rapporteurs for the general regulation , had asked .    3.8423718558177002
unfortunately , this did not happen . mr UNK is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee .    3.969215010254812
i am raising the issue just to reiterate parliament ' s position .    3.785852779361261
thirdly , we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far .    3.6656754730032577
they are particularly beneficial to the member states , and i would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development , job creation and , more particularly , on equal opportunities and transport issues .    4.348828341031662
personally , i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .    3.43300611644583
as an UNK , however , i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development .    3.663170553413875
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves . this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament , and i have raised the issue time and time again .    4.269886882671197
commissioner , we shall continue to raise the issue , as article 158 , paragraph 1 , of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands .    4.611205843719556
therefore , the commission should address the issue once and for all .    3.6622342322533563
the time has come to implement the programmes , and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly .    3.6167138812008415
as for us in parliament , i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may .    3.9494573476003794
i am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep UNK of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes .    3.6040412943521223
mr president , commissioner , in this minute and a half i should like , first of all , to congratulate mrs schroedter .    4.082092743753366
i know many have already done so , but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides , and i think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today .    3.662885773523331
i share the regrets she expressed , namely that parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines , since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that i cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect , which in my view is a pity .    3.846694384089563
consequently , i feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid - term review in 2003 , and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003 .    3.4565329495647092
in brief , i would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000 - 2006 , which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face .    4.140455152569518
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies .    3.359348649022796
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking .    3.8769043032999453
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will , of course , have a considerable impact , both in budgetary and geographical terms .    4.287383171641825
these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us .    4.653260187366885
finally , in this time of natural disasters , i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds .    4.799081986662165
as you know , it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation .    3.9331724355136806
europe should not be completely absent , as the states tend to want .    4.343575690856377
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being UNK to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .    4.080576015183123
i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear .    3.0783542637879884
i also think we should ensure , or ask member states to ensure , that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .    3.706293397309317
mr president , the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form .    3.004167052940404
as far as french planning experts are concerned , for example , the most probable scenario today is that of the UNK of regional disparities within each country .    4.466762076604827
well , the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process .    3.614119098795244
our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator .    3.152241298519088
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds .    3.7706077418799535
what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax , which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at european level .    3.8638949512168073
the commission , however , though bound to issue guidelines , does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner .    3.827063885254988
the report put forward today re - establishes its place in the political sphere .    3.490139143337656
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development .    3.864289966063458
this is what UNK us to vote in favour of it .    3.015102231387521
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .    2.1051952828081304
over the coming years , faced with the challenges of globalisation and UNK enlargement , europe will , more than ever before , require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy .    3.462010799397868
to this end , europe as a whole , and each member state individually , will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities , including the structural funds .    3.6787826334893694
for this to be possible , what we need from the european commission are not just good intentions , but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the member states .    4.53978374120843
for example , in recent years italy has had problems in utilising the structural funds , mainly because of excessive bureaucracy , insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level .    3.5645707918659046
there are , therefore , two points to which i would like to draw the commission ' s attention . firstly , we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision - making , precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided .    3.8503145566223718
secondly , a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent , since , they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated , to the point of hindering access to the funds . this is something about which european small and medium - sized businesses , in particular , tend to complain .    4.144016907168386
mr president , like my colleague mr evans , it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue , especially since i represent a part of the united kingdom , the west midlands , which has hitherto benefited from objective 2 funding in particular .    4.180155644975278
but the report before the house tonight is a prime example of how , if we are not very careful , we can produce very UNK - sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them .    4.140446974357197
the report itself is well - intentioned but , as so often when we deal with these issues , lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for UNK .    3.645015896178519
that is why i and my group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text , not to take anything away from the proposal , but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide .    3.931207634857142
i would like to explain our thinking here .    3.050191933848629
firstly , we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds .    3.4159017552861752
past experience dictates that , as the elected representatives of the european taxpayer , we should , and indeed must , demand financial UNK and transparency in the UNK and auditing of this money , hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as " value for money " indicators in the grant - giving process .    4.000627179194709
next , we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period .    3.402737582738158
but at the mid - way point or end of that period there is no effective way of UNK the project if it has not proved successful .    4.073353219633336
our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable UNK strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer , but we also avoid the well - UNK syndrome of throwing good money after bad .    3.6384805586854956
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .    3.476304084071228
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation .    3.3731117041496854
that way the much - UNK need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the european parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform .    3.978181110488729
if these changes to the report are supported by the house today , i believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about , namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the european union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living , not by giving a hand - out but by giving a " hand - up " .    4.353102652281891
i urge the house to support these changes .    3.764979287032625
mr president , commissioner , i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report , which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work .    3.0232727678129097
despite the steps taken thus far , these levels are still very high , and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment .    3.364585792544819
these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought - out and sensible guidelines .    3.6548019588718894
let us not forget that when these policies are effective , they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life .    2.7851363237004136
let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the european union because their geographical location is a UNK to their economic and social development , unless of course the commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the european mainland .    4.090305140620844
in closing , i would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the best .    4.489957450825779
mr president , mrs schroedter ' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations , and i would like to congratulate her on that .    3.4932446523216356
however , i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community ' s regional policy .    4.29380433332267
quite briefly , structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way , rather it aggravates it .    3.829196146843644
the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been UNK damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the south .    4.814793510006966
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states .    3.112386270357048
if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report , we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities .    4.110835827997366
little consideration , if any at all , has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the union whose shortcomings as regards UNK structure , transport , communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation .    4.449217668140579
the union ' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy .    3.9136350244989857
a large section of the union ' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass - roots .    3.7301575784613354
unfortunately , the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented .    4.24987851559354
mr president , i would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union .    3.6421707286523195
the first is the fundamental , central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion .    3.5475857669611592
we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously .    3.7011830957586267
secondly , i agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and i would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention .    4.4814122337039155
in future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the azores and madeira .    4.324791571029951
i would like to ask if the commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the commission ' s report on the outermost regions , which has been long awaited by parliament ?    4.115604903180146
mr president , commissioner , the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes .    3.582792648526575
however , contrary to their claim to provide guidance , the commission ' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a UNK of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas .    4.1302945922817464
nonetheless , their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities .    3.7271143479313324
i agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the member states on simplifying administration , and i support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour - intensive , small and medium - sized enterprises , on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing , and on start - up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields .    3.287433009672919
i am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my group to paragraph 10 , to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects .    3.790563093987338
i should be very grateful , mrs schroedter , if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations .    3.774680399227008
mr president , commissioner , in the committee on employment and social affairs , we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women .    3.356494518316029
unfortunately , the excellent schroedter report did not take account of this criterion , despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the berend report - how , in fact , these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from europe ' s most highly - developed regions .    3.932759476002217
they are growing , but only in terms of gdp .    4.187214955711677
they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions .    4.324231792295656
commissioner , please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as a matter of priority , because this is our citizens ' greatest problem .    3.409472049823495
please take account , in strategic terms , in the revision and in the allocation of reserves , of employment needs , because this , fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require .    4.6491836142106555
mr president , it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven - year period 2000 - 2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation , particularly for women and young people , and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy .    3.6814079383487717
it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas , employment in rural areas , aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union and for the greek islands which , of course , comprise half of the islands of the union , as stipulated in article 158 of the treaty .    3.8451466165350148
cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a europe which totally UNK the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable .    3.4286460857252803
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments , occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to mrs schroedter ' s report .    2.853465990488334
everyone understands , mrs schroedter , ladies and gentlemen , the reasons and the time limits involved - and i shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays , since we are discussing this report right now , as the representative for the commission , i consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000 - 2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming .    4.938339287326585
mrs schroedter , you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the member states and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters , european union cofinancing of the programmes requires , and is the justification for , a situation where community priorities as debated and approved in this house should also be taken into account in order to promote this community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out .    3.9915188861974613
so , ladies and gentlemen , i should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you , mrs schroedter , and the various members of this house , have made .    4.183790618834485
regarding the role and structure of these guidelines , mr hatzidakis , mrs schroedter and mrs mccarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of structural fund objectives 1 , 2 and 3 as well as their links with the cohesion funds .    3.5600195963137558
this means putting forward the commission ' s priorities , based on past experience in implementing the programmes , as well as current community policies relating to structural operations .    4.0602385950408175
the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of community involvement , including , mr UNK , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies .    3.7394278269718257
when i speak of optimum utilisation , i am referring both to the national and regional levels .    4.072571013698598
and so , mr UNK , i shall also mention at this point , speaking of the national level , the link with the cohesion fund .    4.636811393764555
this is the purpose of these guidelines .    2.9824818777980853
regarding their content , as you know , ladies and gentlemen of this house , they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but , at the same time , very passionately , as i understood her presentation just now .    3.9547409377457305
the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create , in all sectors , but especially in the private sector , as mr berend said , the maximum number of serious , worthwhile and permanent jobs , the competitiveness of regional economies , all regional economies , and in particular , mr evans , that of wales , but not only of wales .    4.396748065627394
and , because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission , let me also add the regional economies of the european regions handicapped by their distance from the centre , be they remote regions , island regions or , of course , the most remote regions which are , naturally , the most distant .    4.513878333220723
perhaps i may inform mr UNK e castro , who asked me about this , that , as i wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions , the commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report .    3.783524194460325
concerning the most remote regions , it was only quite UNK that we received the memorandums from the various governments , but this is not necessarily an excuse , just an explanation .    4.376479877578724
we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work .    2.8089874277403823
i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 november and , within the college , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions . i would thank you for your understanding in this matter .    3.7234858284724845
so that is the first priority , the competitiveness of regional economies .    3.445294150036352
the second priority , which several of you have stressed , mr puerta in particular , but there were others , not that i am mentioning them in any order of priority , is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment , particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past .    4.345324336946334
ladies and gentlemen , we now have a european union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great , proving the effectiveness and worth of the cohesion fund , but where , at the same time , in relation to unemployment - as you wrote , mrs schroedter - an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions . this is a situation which is , as it should be , unjustifiable and intolerable .    3.796473079020863
as far as i am concerned - taking into account my own concept of the construction of europe and regional development policy in particular - this is a situation which i find unacceptable and i have every intention , as far as possible , with your support , of UNK all the appropriations for which i am responsible to this improved social , human and territorial cohesion , particularly in order to prevent what i once called in this house a two - speed europe , a europe of wealthy districts but , at the same time , a europe of impoverished areas .    4.219240872493304
the third objective is urban and rural development , within the scope of a balanced territorial policy .    3.465712636314611
in fact , the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account . the first is rural development , and let me say , mrs schroedter , that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport , an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time .    4.458193836111586
i particularly remember the time when i was minister for the environment in my own country . the second principle is that of equal opportunities , particularly for men and women , as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary union .    4.484500236076262
finally , and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this house , particularly yourself , mrs schroedter , in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies , for development or UNK , which , of all the priorities , offer the maximum opportunity to synergy , to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership . you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership , yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines .    4.6813722697659985
however , i do wish to mention - since you have asked me to do so - that , as far as i am concerned , this partnership - and i spent long enough as a regional UNK within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely - is a tool , one used to involve local UNK , be it in the public sector , in the form of elected representatives , the social and educational sectors , associations , or in the private sector ; a decentralised partnership , and let me mention in this connection , in response to mrs angelilli , the territorial pacts , which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership .    4.159327126156082
these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities , since they must be taken into consideration , under each of the objectives , to different UNK in accordance with the specific situations of each of the member states and regions .    3.834002892378715
i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .    3.6150041619267452
it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date .    2.897032308979576
let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the commission , in the form of a draft in february 1999 , in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text , my predecessor , mrs wulf - mathies , presented them to parliament immediately .    3.45705971604722
due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time , however , parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted , in july 1999 .    4.079206778229686
here in this chamber , ladies and gentlemen , among you , i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as member states are concerned , your observations will certainly be taken into consideration .    4.488939446380271
and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid - term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this house , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .    4.188234974912511
now to the form . on the subject of the role of the guidelines , mrs schroedter , you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives , often very precise ones , should be provided .    4.318087746127338
i shall not list them all , but they include implementing UNK policies , increasing efficiency in the use of public funds , assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together , etc . the commission takes note of these , but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents , such as the guide to the reform of the structural funds or the methodological working document .    3.644236595347422
drawing to a close , i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated , mrs schroedter .    4.1107513811791865
i am thinking , for example , of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations .    3.965036555735827
this claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring ' s negotiations .    3.8411961793578664
the commission kept to the actual text of article 10 of the structural funds regulations , which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide member states with broad , indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed community policies .    3.4980928997607235
i actually quoted the text itself , in UNK marks .    3.8105246872093685
moreover , the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes .    3.5327388031976104
you then mentioned , mrs schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .    3.4373705867710265
i find the opposite the case .    3.365091424407747
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .    3.5882415760788295
indeed , i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere .    3.9133831697264982
as regards rural development , which a number of you brought up , particularly mrs UNK UNK , the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur : a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas , but also protection of the environment and europe ' s rural heritage .    4.688622190076665
it must , however , be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds , whose objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority .    3.9054774208556733
and indeed , on the subject of the balance of rural society , let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section , aimed at promoting reform in european agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture .    3.56826444716512
at this stage , i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 1 regions .    4.030015144986006
in any event , i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter .    2.6681779176183094
before concluding , i should like to tell mr UNK that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck france , austria and germany , in particular , in the last few weeks , and at the same time we shall once again be discussing , together with my fellow commissioner , mrs de palacio , what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of france .    4.066998009637806
i shall therefore reserve the right , if you permit , UNK , to give you my own opinion , which , to a great extent , matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using objective 2 .    4.274404921014039
i shall remind you that the commission is going to be approving the objective 2 zoning plans for france , sweden , austria and luxembourg tomorrow .    3.6131503789945243
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working , particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms .    3.7416536662563593
indeed , this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french departments which have been severely disabled by the storms .    3.8173078744849165
in conclusion , with thanks for your understanding , mr president , i should like to thank you , mrs schroedter , for the quality of your work and that of the committee , and to tell you that i am very pleased , apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines . we have discussed this and i have attempted to clarify my point of view .    4.534887596691761
i am very pleased with the level of support offered by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines , which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes .    4.139241535752029
this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994 - 1999 programmes . i feel this UNK well for effective cooperation between our two institutions , at this time when programming for the period 2000 - 2006 is being undertaken , good joint working practice , which is , mr hatzidakis , backed up by something i am very attentive to : observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions .    3.588855977448208
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.5924185258399082
social and economic situation and development of the regions of the union    3.8538470714401836
the next item is the debate on the report ( a5 - 0107 / 1999 ) by mr berend , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union [ sec ( 99 ) 0066 - c5 - 0120 / 99 - 1999 / 2123 ( cos ) ] .    2.4159467357654707
mr president , commissioner , this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report .    3.0037233357546658
i consider , however , that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in europe offers a somewhat over - simplified view of the situation and , unfortunately , this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches .    4.273892292555011
the commission report generally UNK this observation , particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special interest , by which i mean the french overseas departments and , more generally , the most remote regions .    3.9042727602402727
in this respect , i am pleased to see that the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam .    3.440176354810232
even if the commission is still reluctant to say so in too explicit a fashion , its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to promote polycentric development of the community area through the union ' s structural policies and within the scope of the approach initiated by the sec .    3.694584060094981
mr president , the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with the report that mr berend has just presented and congratulates the author , both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility , which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee .    3.1250902989903446
it must be remembered that , currently , the european union ' s overall competitiveness is , in general terms , 81 % of that of the united states of america and that this figure will only improve if the figure for our competitive units , that is the regions , also improves . furthermore , this is at a time when technological development , economic globalisation and our problems , which are enlargement and the single currency , demand that the regions , as well as businesses and individuals , make more of an effort to be competitive .    4.318363177237437
the european commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .    3.1850683966777606
i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur , one positive and one negative .    3.720907948464539
the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the union and that the community funds have been a major , although not decisive , factor in reducing regional inequalities .    4.402724734719345
the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions ' gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment .    3.496021318688344
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation .    2.5427635660144206
this , commissioner , is the first UNK for the coming period .    6.040909861379728
thus , mr president , i ask my fellow members to approve this report and i ask the commission , as other speakers have done , to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000 - 2006 .    3.9759149145647603
mr president , commissioner , i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it .    3.169356041315093
the sixth UNK report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the union ' s regional policy aims .    3.9336871923192054
the report shows that growth has been UNK , despite all our efforts .    3.3283598033786244
very rapid growth is continuing in central europe .    3.122809711655697
the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general european average , whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly .    2.9597042032023553
we now require an in - depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .    3.4219287086295407
is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences , long distances , UNK that are too cold or too hot , UNK populations and austere conditions ?    3.443728907713533
how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development ?    4.216294456262061
it is also important to discover what the effects of union enlargement will be on structural funds and the development of the union ' s more remote areas .    3.792977520311501
the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility .    3.5986944575847395
some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased .    3.6387756579828263
this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced .    3.161621966916909
in the future , we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place .    3.39194404007263
for example , uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration .    3.381010735763648
in this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development .    3.3396491202370098
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know - how .    3.0993998361776374
our group is in favour of adopting this report .    3.5620756573541255
mr president , commissioner , the european union ' s regional policy has , until now , not been able to interpret , in any significant way , the existing differences in our inhabitants ' incomes .    3.6261667425671233
we have a serious situation in which in the european union today , there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty , as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached , on average , 23 . 7 % in the regions worst affected , regions which also happen to be poor areas , whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment , corresponding to the richer areas , unemployment stands at just 4 % .    3.714096075772359
given this situation , the report approved by parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment : measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes , which are often UNK , with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems , with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the trans - european rail networks , which are due in UNK .    4.107751642440339
there should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries ' agriculture and fisheries , which are often UNK by the european union ' s own insensitive policies , as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs , particularly for women and young people . only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality , which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects .    4.118595737399315
mr president , commissioner , mr berend ' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the european commission UNK as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore .    4.263289810024017
the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation , boosting equality of opportunity , increasing the sustainability of employment and development , are only mentioned in passing .    4.291126126153195
this attitude appears to me to be unjustified . i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report .    3.8867683814926615
this does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness , particularly as i myself am an entrepreneur in an objective 1 region , that is in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany , and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium - sized enterprises .    3.605059513872097
it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the objective 1 regions , that is to say job creation measures , special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business .    3.2130671991113866
they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities .    3.0479074503688195
supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development , simply because there is no basis for a self - supporting upturn in these objective 1 regions .    4.001961280733838
after all , the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment UNK the fact than an increase of at least 3 % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all .    3.4812940832162997
concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand - orientated economic policy is not the answer .    3.921658894284082
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and , to a lesser extent , in rationalisation .    3.605953627787215
it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand - orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas .    3.411051248921199
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions .    3.0389240504167807
in other words , what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there .    3.9005226179989965
for example , these would be measures for vocational training , for further education , for re - integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process , for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements , in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again .    3.9461813872218907
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union .    3.5844084635068643
from the sixth periodic report on the regions , one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect .    3.391276730843391
the efforts made in order to drive up the gdp per capita in objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase , not really a satisfying result over a period during which , certainly over the past couple of years , there has been economic growth .    3.822613342865934
as indicated by the rapporteur , the effects of the structural measures , on the other hand , are minimal as far as employment is concerned .    4.3425110841164845
some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for .    3.5974138742708304
also , the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions .    2.955797662074193
mr president , it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities , especially in connection with boosting employment .    3.3393215893423984
it is , after all , they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit .    2.8352279333711277
by allowing them to develop tailor - made plans for the relevant regions and , if necessary , tying this in with financial aid , a higher return can be achieved .    3.2687045016239034
surely this must be the ultimate goal .    2.893427439920689
i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions .    3.9800261980605134
following on from this , it is probably also more meaningful , with regard to the financial aid to regions , to give member states more say anyway .    4.696155100714581
the report shows that , in general , they are a long way behind eu countries , especially in terms of gdp per capita .    4.666531897864339
with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future , it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy . i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later .    3.8424668476124864
mr president , commissioner , following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part .    3.6576502630222203
for example , whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased , there has been a certain amount of convergence between the member states themselves in this respect .    3.795311192383607
equally , unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all , indeed they rose in some cases .    3.8143551650868317
i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently .    4.449726214661966
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries .    4.319534961408217
since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce unemployment , then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development , improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training .    3.923617614377246
genuine structural reforms and a competition - friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base .    3.358693028219963
if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost - intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term , then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed .    3.6022800673210966
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate .    4.958069851312807
mr president , commissioner , my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report , because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of europe will judge that we have been successful in our work .    3.9364366167954383
this issue , which has an impact on their everyday life , is a key issue as regards eu credibility .    4.292317960325018
it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided , i would say quite UNK , the development of poor countries .    4.431170343810369
i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i UNK through those countries for the first time twenty - five years ago .    3.339405951908727
in this connection , french speakers would speak of a " coup de UNK " : in other words , i take my hat off to the eu .    3.292363757181916
the eu really deserves such a gesture , but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great .    3.0342665106715554
what is the result ?    3.735172609212895
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a UNK .    3.099868533587608
consequently , we have to build schools , hospitals , and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over .    4.88714435140055
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems .    3.269575759634665
most people , however , would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised , if they were given the chance to , in other words , if there was work there .    5.567080642305782
we must give them this opportunity .    2.968685298601281
this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have .    4.007877284052503
the solution , as i see it , lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship .    3.462145699847904
by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business , but creating will .    4.041560647351557
i mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life , whether he or she is an employee , the owner of a business or an official .    3.256039587742715
what is a fair society ?    3.3892506177246173
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children .    3.294473137339773
in this way , positive development of the regions is also possible , because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance .    3.730252250471348
finally , i would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from america , where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of UNK , as it often is here in europe .    3.779649671028213
mr president , commissioner , as my time is limited , i shall get straight to the point .    3.5465805516431073
firstly , let me make a statement of fact : the fruits of growth are not distributed UNK within the union .    3.423069138146575
the most remote regions , still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates , offer one example of this .    2.6289974438901482
in UNK , for example , the rate is 37 % .    4.084596498752926
this is not a situation related to the economic climate , however ; rather it is a structural problem , created by our remoteness , our UNK , in short , our own specific personality .    4.1894814848846105
the principle of specific , exceptional treatment was envisaged in article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam in order to deal with such cases .    3.4096750818408266
it only remains to put this principle into practice .    3.5869071635888616
the commission document expected to be ready in december 1999 was delayed until january , then february , and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism .    3.3902591471753567
i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission .    2.9178671728314716
as regards taxation , state aid , the structural funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .    3.101437758113959
if these do not materialise , then , unfortunately , convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us , and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions , despite the size of the amounts committed , will end in failure .    4.270855687658594
mr president , as all the previous speakers have done , i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report .    3.585860089656919
just like the previous report , this extremely competent and precise analysis , the recommendations it supports and your own comments , ladies and gentlemen , shall prove useful to the commission in general and to the commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000 - 2006 .    4.055495440244683
i should also like to make a few comments , firstly , mr berend , regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report .    3.377424668229213
you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote , if i am not mistaken , that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports .    4.478764603595969
on behalf of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor , mrs wulf - mathies , i must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself .    4.160119422396667
the commission was certainly very anxious to ensure , mr berend , that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you .    4.084690149887754
i am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter 2 . 1 of this report , where the commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported , improved and influenced by factors which some of you - mr markov , just now , and mrs UNK - stressed very forcefully .    3.3707913261282068
i am thinking of technological research and development , infrastructure provision and quality , human resources potential , small and medium - sized businesses and direct investment from abroad .    2.803180878791555
so much for the quality .    3.6836495050189786
i do not wish to spend time right now , mr berend , going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed .    3.6061352958710833
let me just UNK them : the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy , particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the member states .    4.281977546938158
secondly , partnership , a subject which a number of you stressed , the role of local and regional authorities , the private sector , both sides of industry , associations and local community action groups .    3.677759074736867
regarding this problem of partnership , i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly .    4.168544074345373
thirdly , the need to develop the employment side of growth , even though i am aware , as mr van dam just said , that the prime responsibility is that of the member states , and that , when we speak of the responsibility of member states , and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy , we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in .    5.0660217224355755
mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed UNK .    3.2923231394161747
mr fruteau , we at least need to recognise that there is growth , and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession , as has been the case in the past .    4.259760880061643
you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike .    2.873153427234154
i agree with your analysis .    3.247515637800687
when there is growth , it must be better distributed , but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness , be they the most remote or island regions , is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades .    4.139640902091447
fourthly , a point which mrs UNK UNK stressed just now , the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people .    3.7449264564995506
finally , the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the structural funds , the motives of officials in managing these funds , even if it is occasionally complicated , and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation , follow - up and supervision of the commission .    4.071457692122212
in relation to this , i must inform the european parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of structural funds .    4.1997574482654185
i should like to mention a few specific points .    2.6197880715754644
mr berend , you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly .    3.021804419696593
well , we are coming to an end of the zoning phase .    4.23084786256992
tomorrow , the commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon , i hope , it will be italy ' s turn .    4.69250956952994
you may therefore be satisfied on this point , since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 2 .    3.968638196710435
regarding the informal economy you mention in your report , i am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and , as mr UNK mentioned , there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data .    4.319888112564762
to a certain extent , they are taken into account in the statistics on gdp and labour force surveys and , in any case , i wish to point out the efforts which eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics .    3.6582824700992687
mr berend , you also mentioned , as did mr UNK sánchez , the lack of reform in the fisheries sector .    3.9696306169377213
on this point which is of personal interest to me , let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context .    4.3937129875255
this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries , under commissioner fischler .    3.413778776724336
nonetheless , i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which , no doubt , will respond better to these concerns .    3.6410763847104723
several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion , and your rapporteur mentioned some of these .    4.191396915749571
in any event , i have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report : the definition , compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of central and eastern europe ; a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned , particularly mrs sudre and mr fruteau ; analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of central and eastern europe . this will constitute a great challenge to us all , for you and for the commission , in the next few years .    3.899312064987695
finally , i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are , in any case , familiar with , but whose main elements i should like to reiterate .    3.6636858675410187
ladies and gentlemen , considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence , particularly for the four cohesion countries , but also frankly , mr UNK , for the objective 2 regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development , especially regarding infrastructure .    3.992866271437461
my second point regarding the policy is as follows : the structural funds have made , and continue to make , a significant contribution to the convergence process .    3.964381854734143
all the macroeconomic models we are working on show that , over the last decade , more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the structural funds .    3.660871335926178
i have , however , taken note , particularly with regard to the most remote regions , mrs sudre , mr fruteau , and mr nogueira román too , that your observation is that there is still much to do - and this is my third point regarding the policy - in terms of improving employment take - up aspects , the fight against social exclusion , which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions , and the integration of women and young people into the labour market .    4.339910853731732
now to my fourth point regarding the policy ; enlargement of the union , the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions , the major challenge , too , for the european policy on cohesion , a point which mr van dam highlighted .    4.480803186786468
i am thinking in particular of the pre - accession structural instrument , which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks .    3.2035689292552356
you see , ladies and gentlemen , we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the union ' s enlargement on our structural policy .    3.9538998971481414
this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole , mr berend , is a good basis for our thinking , for us all and for myself .    4.23462014476321
i should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines , as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000 - 2006 .    4.347830827686513
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.894443415166077

adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.3506184552294846
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .    1.9245484651696183
are there any comments ?    2.070454319710833
mr president , i respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes .    3.609882098083285
i refer to item 11 on the order of business .    2.576838079141629
firstly , i believe the issue raised by the president of the socialist group yesterday about the UNK of the debate with the president of the commission on the five - year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated .    4.28252222054655
i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group .    3.2945462449630214
the second point i would like to make - and which i would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this parliament , as other speakers remarked yesterday , can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the european commission .    4.146740045634389
we should also have the UNK to recognise that , if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and UNK by the president of the commission , but also by a five - year programme , we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this house , so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the commission what our wishes were .    4.464484754801198
there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this .    4.145397749568303
when there are major set - piece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future , we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance .    4.203722825153072
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission .    4.195861984457256
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary UNK in institutional relationships .    3.211654695678821
looking at some of the press reports of last friday , i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable self - restraint in the way they commented publicly .    4.550187825622053
that is something for which i have a deep appreciation .    4.329489917912485
i hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which i believe was founded on a UNK as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions .    3.8010742091317353
it should not be UNK into something more than that .    3.216337316801426
thank you very much , mr cox .    2.3024664013277145
i understand what you are saying .    3.523694010626863
we have taken note of this .    2.623442432834069
mr president , concerning item 11 of the minutes on the order of business , we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on today ' s agenda .    3.384213777651466
however , it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on .    3.7192217487387507
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today ' s agenda .    3.2395845480021226
mr UNK , that makes sense .    3.861811982211636
the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda .    2.814335719625035
mr president , regarding mrs lynne ' s comments yesterday about health and safety in this building , i presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the tower .    3.396688685419373
this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong .    4.027460553984777
i do not want to UNK up the issue of this building endlessly , but this is a serious problem .    3.7775133382423465
mrs ahern , we have taken note of this .    3.7140444462730953
i would ask you to bring this specific case , which has to do with the UNK on a particular floor , to the attention of the quaestors , who are , in fact , responsible for the matter .    4.924492197369012
we will also pass this on to our services , however .    3.3760827080523717
thank you very much .    2.4004302117423095

reform of european competition policy    4.812157229403757
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :    1.9129003561689215
a5 - 0069 / 1999 by mr von wogau , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission white paper on modernisation of the rules implementing articles 85 and 86 of the ec treaty [ com ( 1999 ) 101 - c5 - 0105 / 1999 - 1999 / 2108 ( cos ) ] ;    2.29196079311216
a5 - 0078 / 1999 by mr rapkay , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the european commission ' s xxviiith report on competition policy 1998 [ UNK ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0121 / 1999 - 1999 / 2124 ( cos ) ] ;    2.4840786988611416
a5 - 0087 / 1999 by mr jonckheer , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors . [ com ( 1999 ) 148 - c5 - 0107 / 1999 - 1999 / 2110 ( cos ) ] ( report 1995 - 1997 ) ;    2.368994202426351
a5 - 0073 / 1999 by mr langen , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission report on the implementation in 1998 of commission decision no . 2496 / 96 / ecsc of 18 december 1996 establishing community rules for state aid to the steel industry ( steel aid code ) . [ com ( 1999 ) 94 - c5 - 0104 / 1999 - 1999 / 2107 ( cos ) ] .    2.069189210482148
mr president , commissioner , today we are engaged in an important debate about the european union ' s competition policy .    3.1904888919111682
we are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for european monopolies law , that is mr von wogau ' s report , and it is far more controversial than the vote in the committee on economic and monetary affairs may have given us reason to believe .    3.9626363246057217
i want to make it quite clear that in this specific case i personally consider the commission ' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term " modernisation " to describe the content of articles 81 and 82 of the white paper , or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression " retrograde step " .    3.8031518385981187
however , we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998 , and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter .    3.9095315120868404
but , of course , both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper .    3.695840131033055
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy .    3.9168580893076133
on reading both commission documents , one UNK that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed , which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us .    3.586588181347236
allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture . as the competent authority , the commission , with its logically consistent approach , has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition , not always to the delight of the member states or enterprises concerned .    4.345755364842191
it should continue along this path .    3.0805021421641476
but , commissioner , none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the union , the deepening of the internal market , technological progress , globalisation .    3.9182400460581994
indeed , it is not just about modernisation of community law , more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases , about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions , for the european competition policy will be dependent on the population ' s acceptance , together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned .    4.436690422220817
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .    3.3020367096460173
the competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but , in fact , there is nothing that could not be further improved upon .    4.476256986525272
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought , commissioner , but there is one point that i would just like to go into now . transparency and accountability belong together .    4.280241920578545
the commission is the executive and parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role , for the sake of its own independence ; but parliament is a supervisory body , and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one ' s decisions than a democratically - elected parliament , indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion ?    3.7373220043446627
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen , strengthening and intensifying it .    3.3260516838874516
there is one thing i would like to make quite clear though . parliament is a legislative body , but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law , of all things , is truly scandalous .    4.641019920518403
therefore , i would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area .    4.383140341709211
i expect the commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve parliament in doubtful cases , even given the treaty status quo .    3.3470509358670766
i also expect the commission to be pro - active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .    3.2189527516447782
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions .    3.623050693263355
with all due respect for the principle of competition , competition is not , however , an end in itself .    4.411070695310876
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions .    3.525071030566348
at the end of the day , one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an UNK .    3.713527543945555
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts .    3.304858448003936
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses , monopolies law being one example .    3.5152529450369787
but on the whole , this only serves to prevent abuses ; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation .    3.1666722693750287
however , since state aid forms the lion ' s share of the competition report 1998 i would still like , regardless of mr jonckheer ' s report , to say one more thing about it .    3.2275167907284485
it is certainly possible , indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium - sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy .    3.7067165216602613
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes , provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition .    3.9128206430510817
this is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible .    3.889408190577965
my last comment was intended not so much for the commission as for the members of the group of the european people ' s party .    3.905940396272799
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report which i have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the commission ' s annual report on the state aid in force within the european union and for which the community is authorised under articles 87 , 88 and 89 of the treaties .    3.8560762715083823
the commission report is essentially a UNK report UNK the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors , according to various UNK , such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued .    4.0914308803776285
let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid , on average , for the period under review , is in the order of eur 95 billion , corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993 - 1995 , a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the federal republic of germany .    3.998104034831504
to put it plainly , the level of state aid declared , roughly speaking , is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1 . 2 % of community gdp or more or less the equivalent , UNK , of the community budget for one year .    4.209717806524959
this being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage UNK .    3.7297867616428855
i think it is also interesting to add state aid and community aid , which may be UNK in some way into state aid .    4.258955688741744
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the cohesion fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .    3.9047074599232667
this being the case , let me now come to the proposals made in the report .    4.19066531895104
we note , first of all , that the committee considers the data , as presented in the commission ' s annual report , to be in too aggregated a form to enable an in - depth evaluation of state aid policy which is simultaneously legitimate , sensitive to national interests and extensive in terms of compliance with the rules of competition , pursuant to the actual terms of the treaty .    4.624583044310847
the commission can only UNK and analyse the data provided by the member states .    2.79318277315028
it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided , and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect .    4.098202072650943
it is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example , has championed the UNK idea of a public register of state aid , accessible via the internet .    3.417475275902489
having better , more detailed information available , particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded , must make it possible for the european commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies .    4.0799899216772015
and insofar as such studies already exist , to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the treaties , which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the european economy , but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion .    4.469625393307471
by stressing , primarily , the quality of the information provided , our debate in committee , and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you , avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was , in absolute terms , either too high or not high enough .    4.079001769823347
most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between , on the one hand , the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and , on the other hand , acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the treaty , particularly , as i have said already , as regards sustainable development , research and development and economic and social cohesion .    4.285400702691295
this being the case , various amendments to the rapporteur ' s initial draft report were adopted in committee , particularly highlighting the need for effective UNK of aid found to be illegal as well as the establishment of a league table of results .    3.874285405915333
seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting .    3.562120648104099
most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid , in view of the inadequacies , acknowledged or not , of private investment alone , the market failures or inadequacies of the market .    3.7622601898121695
i should like to conclude this presentation , commissioner , by stressing two things : firstly , a concern of the members of the committee and , secondly , a demand of our committee .    4.079375947880687
the concern involves the pre - accession process for the countries of central and eastern europe , in terms of competition policy and state aid .    3.267608670003537
this is undoubtedly a complex issue , and one where we should like to see the commission informing us of the latest development in the matter , particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and , as far as state aid is concerned , the need , in all UNK , to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors .    5.007125821004994
and finally , in conclusion , our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the european parliament in the matters we are discussing , competition policy and state aid , in the context of the intergovernmental conference .    3.8174391979166797
as you know , commissioner , our report UNK that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid .    4.081558046898123
there were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the commission submitted its own report on these .    4.840023433002026
the ecsc treaty is due to expire shortly .    3.7363815469559407
the european commission ' s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the european parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying article 88 of the ecsc treaty .    4.016561166860572
the competitiveness of the european steel industry also forms the subject of the commission ' s most recent communication , which we have not yet debated in parliament .    4.566184536849997
as in other sectors , the general ban on state aid according to article 87 ( 1 ) of the ec treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry .    3.576812667115879
according to this article , state aid is irreconcilable with the common market , in principle . exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases .    3.838465758925158
under article 88 , the commission is obliged to supervise state aid .    4.077271002959005
in 1998 , the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling eur UNK million to the UNK in germany .    3.5824751258833207
furthermore , the member states must give the commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid .    3.759885544536132
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 december 1996 .    3.2684808767336575
these stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular , precisely - defined cases i . e . those involving aid for research and development , aid for environmental protection , social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non - competitive enterprises cease trading altogether .    3.5990717001075914
in addition , there is a special provision of up to eur 50 million for greece .    3.3050805034834054
however , there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report .    3.6687420564508586
as far as parliament is concerned , it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired .    4.0784222511414985
there must be no watering - down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code .    2.776236370044424
no one wants an UNK subsidy competition in europe .    2.9360401573261306
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market , regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years .    4.119920860561668
consequently , parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry ' s claims about unequal treatment , and for the commission to provide the council with follow - up regulations .    4.245929751270255
we all know that so far the council has dragged its feet with regard to follow - up regulations of this kind .    3.9562620983100576
the reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the UNK of the european commission ' s supervision .    4.608183843359204
we therefore demand that once the treaty expires , steel aid must be regulated by a council regulation according to article 94 , for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity .    3.639809921394317
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code .    2.5974001526273103
a council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments .    4.185778151984066
what we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets .    3.6620788587539055
we also need to criticise the commission ' s practice of approving multiple aid packages for steel enterprises which in their view , do not fall within the categories of the code , even given the fact that the european court of justice approved this unequal treatment where certain individual decisions were concerned .    3.343527251249623
the commission will be called upon , in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year 1999 , to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the UNK of restructuring plans and approved exemptions , thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made .    4.3048528353981945
once the committee on economic and monetary affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions , i would ask that we make full use of this opportunity , which we have ourselves created , in plenary sitting .    3.8914600696197525
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the internal market is not complete .    2.807788186908828
subsidies , monopolies and barriers to competition are still UNK markets and development alike .    3.1623370375638777
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .    4.270350382702205
subsidies distort allocations , both within and between countries .    3.7346480881088833
a successive phasing out of state aid is required , and more and more markets must be opened up to competition .    3.9876386343208177
this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies , both private and public .    3.3462110411477406
public monopolies are , more often than not , phased out reluctantly .    2.8919741411914246
increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare , including within the spheres of education , health care and social services .    3.7087957520207864
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures .    3.0422316667578104
europe must be modernised , made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies .    3.1424226975245206
effective competition UNK prices down and raises standards of living .    3.0988665497931573
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently .    3.1780845779397398
in fact , competition policy and consumer policy belong together .    3.3369554431812425
the internal market is the basis for our work .    4.5386155299806195
its legislation is to apply equally to all , to large and small countries alike .    3.736221353294415
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled .    3.852354845492569
the eu ' s own regulations too may therefore need to be analysed .    3.705410469368889
the new model now being tested by the commission ought not to lead to a process of UNK pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .    3.7923069378565417
in order to be effective , it must be well anchored in the member states ' national authorities .    3.5567608725373687
in six months ' time , it may be appropriate to carry out an analysis of the outcome and also to look more closely at the new situation ' s effects upon the commission ' s role .    4.223327216488163
the question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter - institutional congress which will open up an UNK debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests .    3.1903671365188417
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed .    4.37143719704639
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate .    3.706620724282715
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition .    3.321695496547636
wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership , which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for .    3.737552140438815
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us .    2.9420968899979014
a conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to UNK out misunderstandings , at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points .    3.4131870605340655
parliament and the commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens .    4.094855629795582
in fact , in my own constituency of stockholm , we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies .    3.598221460737125
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by mr von wogau and mr rapkay .    4.000915846776055
we hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law .    3.8540666747815435
mr president , as a new member i am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today , even though there has been a delay .    3.8463549471573955
i would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs mr von wogau , mr langen , mr rapkay and mr jonckheer , as well as the commission , for their excellent cooperation .    3.5392690233974804
competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and european competition policy is a success story ; take the energy and telecommunications sectors , where there has been a UNK lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service .    3.5998567090043188
all this is to the good of the consumer .    3.7183979913687883
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further .    4.032394635160811
the commission has put forward a new white paper on this containing two key points : dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement .    2.622084315779084
dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs , at any rate .    3.1145833312148894
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more UNK being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .    3.439379470667479
it will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved ; for one thing , each person will have to take responsibility themselves , and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters .    3.8519984321941823
however i believe that we should use this opportunity for europe to set down a UNK for less red tape .    3.7460437963476716
the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement .    2.2518583428417114
if we are to create a culture of law in europe , then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the commission , by central bodies , but also by national authorities , by national courts .    4.58411600752708
we are not discussing the fact that although every eu law is only ever decided on centrally , it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty .    4.145035226177713
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the commission in this matter .    3.959796184655325
the way to a european monopolies commission must be kept clear , something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion .    3.960303156554728
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy .    4.098669779223539
parliament must have more involvement and i also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted , then this would encourage the member states to be more disciplined .    4.839270884567022
however , when it comes to what the future holds for competition , there are two issues dear to my heart .    3.655188435668993
one is subsidiarity .    3.0673900755001213
we all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency , and i believe we should also permit competition in the regions .    4.516115807295679
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union .    3.47608388184433
i would cite , by way of example , the issue of job creation schemes , savings banks and regional banks , and UNK .    3.977893352230091
here , a region has , by its own efforts , created a means of marketing its own products .    3.7032134490123276
this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention .    3.946708307933202
i believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation .    3.6684847974525994
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other .    3.684981629457583
my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy , although i am not going to talk about market failure just now .    3.457939489468607
i have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector , but i would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters .    3.788664601054037
these days , someone who lives in an old people ' s home is accommodated within the social field .    3.263903688411123
however , i could also regard them as a customer , and i believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field , that is UNK structures , stifle competition .    3.9917313880643057
apart from that , i could refer to any customers , any sector , as customers , and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields .    3.2857443226349274
to conclude , i would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity . i believe it to be of vital importance that where member states allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes , they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across - the - board regulation by europe .    3.889497571882067
thank you very much , mr radwan .    2.6072391022122727
mr president , commissioner , i am speaking on behalf of my fellow member , robert goebbels , who is unable to attend due to a political commitment .    3.323810722953337
within the committee on economic and monetary affairs , the jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market .    3.345865308261753
a slim right - wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures .    3.1402146005466376
even if the majority in this house were to adhere to this UNK idea of a supposedly perfect market , it would not make any difference to the real world .    4.399153762270052
economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources .    3.34455268421865
while , since the dawn of time , the market has been the key forum for human UNK , it has never been perfect .    4.941046815469509
the market favours the short term and immediate profits .    3.3230239479308388
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers .    3.3223321241937005
in order to function , the market needs rules .    3.7264907003204017
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be UNK by a sense of responsibility towards society .    3.9590640657259577
we european socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose .    4.16106987831926
the market is not an end in itself ; it must help to improve the human condition .    3.346088585839732
the european union or individual states must not take over from economic operators , but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion .    3.5923850376121376
the main objective of the union ' s competition policy cannot be to reduce the overall level of aid .    3.6857139538808066
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union , particularly economic and social cohesion , sustainable development and research .    3.998076587267542
the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market .    3.1048885276587295
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid .    2.623913132032743
the internet is not a product of the market , but the result of research financed by the american army .    5.181278968546903
the world wide web , which has enabled the UNK development of the information society , was developed by UNK in geneva , once again with public aid .    4.07886413064396
the german government ' s intervention to save the holzmann group was criticised as an unjustifiable constraint upon the market economy .    3.215495157115764
president duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness , the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism .    3.385072475704082
public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation , as was the case in mexico , asia and brazil .    3.480150422504643
human labour , on the other hand , is considered to be a simple factor in the equation .    4.043816504965771
we socialists reject the liberals ' naïve optimism on this point .    2.9611991071104056
we want a true culture of competition in europe .    3.0946380520277574
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge .    3.9663307194412183
mr president , commissioner , i want to begin by thanking mr rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation .    3.105703079935616
i want to thank you , commissioner monti , for your outstanding cooperation and i want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .    4.252793520884755
it is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments . these may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy , but their capacity to UNK havoc seems UNK .    3.4215705147381197
let me mention the latest examples we have seen : holzmann , a company which receives considerable aid from the german government ; UNK in former east germany ; and , especially , aid to shipyards .    3.216807905733624
these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being UNK out of their markets .    3.7462328534965152
i want to say to mr poos that i very much agree with mr duisenberg that these examples show that some eu member states are not in a position to restructure their economies and , to that extent , are helping to undermine the value of the euro .    3.473439864836137
the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party has tabled 80 amendments in the committee , all concerning state aid .    2.787520072119271
these are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness , which is very important with a view to making the internal market work .    4.65127350188937
as i say , our amendments concern transparency , and i should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful , specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be .    4.1534774836181745
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful .    4.69445387150988
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back ?    3.3075889912322736
at present , there are no common rules in this area , and we vigorously urge the commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment .    4.271403909656666
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition .    3.199115309307151
finally , we propose keeping both a register , as mentioned by a number of my fellow meps , and also a scoreboard showing where the member states at present stand with regard to state aid .    4.207151205242402
you have shown us the way , mr monti , with the single market scoreboard .    4.447082240672469
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid .    3.6050126733894214
i very much hope that you , commissioner monti , will support these amendments , and i look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter .    3.7653426362471185
to conclude , i want to welcome the commission ' s UNK report on competition policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .    4.577282315041994
but , as i have already mentioned , our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness .    3.3389642285049916
there is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned , and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid .    4.192097848627533
this is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the union , and i should like to thank mr jonckheer who , in his report , has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria , as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition .    4.1380492689979995
as liberals and greens , we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look , but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives , and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems .    4.296004293810834
mr president , commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .    3.584362204797926
are state aid to business or inter - company agreements legitimate in a market economy , and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy ?    3.8752427164987715
regarding the first point , we say quite clearly that , in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the european union has endorsed , it is essential that , in some instances , there is state aid to businesses , be it in the form of tax exemptions , special taxation or even direct aid .    4.871407228303921
it is also legitimate for there to be inter - company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements , since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements .    3.1161962757820505
so our clear response is that , yes , such aid and such agreements are legitimate , but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified .    4.021945187605187
the von wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level .    3.26633268373826
we feel this is relatively dangerous , but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the commission cannot do everything .    4.25850517523171
we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact .    3.979324935385212
mr president , once again we are debating the european union ' s competition policy .    3.352358380729611
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us .    3.968385387932782
the overriding features of today ' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of UNK powerful multinational groups .    3.206514712679914
should we not be discussing this issue ?    3.0256940715247413
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private - sector monopolies .    3.428341375490563
certain sectors of european industry , such as the shipbuilding industry , air transport and the steel industry , which have been hard hit by existing competition policy , have suffered UNK .    4.034527572504857
they have lost their status , and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant .    4.239218240089772
when will we debate that ?    3.014954534667733
the scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states , and member states of the union at that .    3.760982829357156
and yet , we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by UNK public procurement contracts placed with public - sector corporations as state aid .    2.9738496512374946
at the same time , unemployment is UNK as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs .    2.998835839035657
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights .    4.158397512184463
consumers see their standard of living being eroded , poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the union being dismantled and UNK in the name of UNK and catastrophic competition , in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business .    3.9314284427695254
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it .    3.9977790694666564
mr president , commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .    3.6782171609131074
the competition policy has , as far as these resources permitted , contributed to this event .    4.054558989351051
for our part , we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which , far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency , imprisons us in an artificial UNK , which has been imposed on the peoples of europe .    3.4152960019886818
having said that , governing means planning . it also means being responsible and , in this new context which has been forced upon us , competition law naturally has an essential role to play .    3.820876221773152
in this area , the commission has given priority to a number of routes of action : acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti - competitive practices , by UNK its departments ' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law .    3.3316071029638628
as regards state aid , it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex , and the introduction of a public register , where all aid would be recorded , does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints .    3.9207170861589256
finally , on the subject of modernising the implementation of articles 85 and 86 of the treaty , we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction .    3.362615536107852
the commission is , in fact , retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities , but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the commission at all .    4.070674720433212
national states would thus become the secular arm of the commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control .    4.264754247886058
in conclusion , i would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction , we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the UNK of federalism which , if it were realised , would be to the detriment of europe and the sovereignty of the states .    4.12241214444816
mr president , commissioner , we have a basically positive view of the commission ' s white paper on competition , particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation , but we are also UNK by several things .    4.04539799732302
first of all , there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers , though necessary in many ways , will cause an abnormal increase in competition - related initiatives , and that some people will be tempted to use competition law , not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails , of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets , but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy , planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves , or even for protectionist purposes .    3.657091256701195
in this respect , we should heed the words of von UNK , and doubtless also those of the great italian liberal UNK UNK , who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti - competition policies .    3.637931768278322
state interference in the economy is , even today , still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market , competition and freedom of choice for european users and consumers .    4.385045349774045
there is state aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the italian treasury controls 15 % of stock exchange UNK ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about UNK ' s bid for UNK and the UNK of holzmann .    4.015041015153359
finally , commissioner , we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state , ranging from state television , which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer , and the post office , to some compulsory insurance schemes , including health and social welfare systems , which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no - one but the wealthy user with any other option .    4.007563779017729
commissioner , i am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the treaties , but i believe that , it must be emphasised once again that the european economy is finding it hard to compete with the american economy , especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition .    4.45978351807211
what is being done may well be very important , but it is still not sufficient .    4.859455714649645
mr president , a white paper , by definition , is not something you can take or leave .    3.6323192155933643
it is there to generate reactions and the white paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .    3.4132906338863025
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .    4.366680998110503
i understand where the authors are coming from and i share their views .    3.3004225767965387
i also assume that you , commissioner , want to honour the reputation of , and the work put in by , your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective .    3.8244711748307583
i cannot imagine the commission taking initiatives in order to de - UNK or re - UNK in a thorough manner , but i have my concerns and questions nevertheless .    4.562670299543778
firstly , these relate to the coherence of the policy ' s application .    3.7772464446191356
in general , i am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market .    3.899381517607736
the internal market needs a uniform competition policy , not only in terms of concept , but also in terms of application .    4.903661417159038
it is true , there are some european regulations and UNK statements on the way .    3.7482903314047635
the commission is also said to have the right of UNK and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities .    4.467919412863633
but i still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of UNK UNK where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward .    4.259320785638004
so , i would like to hear more about how the commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the white paper to be feasible .    3.4648736224095122
secondly , i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty .    3.1189257407042716
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .    3.280776735910529
this instrument will fall by the UNK in future .    4.112391033064413
in the white paper , you state that the commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines , but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next ?    4.165392237620682
thirdly , i would like to know whether the commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy .    3.2639520937013207
i have particular concerns regarding the fate of smes which will lose part of their legal and financial protection , as is already the case , one has got to admit , within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector .    3.446196922113013
fourthly , i would like to be informed of why the commission does not choose to apply the UNK penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules .    4.3142629959152545
fifthly , with the pending enlargement , i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game .    4.109708180030324
they are still in training , as it were .    4.174333592532533
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into first - class players in the league of the internal market ?    3.874561166724802
sixthly and lastly , i would remind you of a point that i have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions , namely the legal privilege of company lawyers .    4.225091288504866
if the commission implements the white paper objectives , it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable .    3.4639684897493015
is the commission considering taking any action to allow in - house lawyers in all member states legal privilege ?    3.5156401137012367
commissioner , i am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and i hope that , in this sense , we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain UNK but can bear fruit .    4.320085227181356
mr president , i would like , in beginning my speech regarding the white paper , to congratulate the rapporteur , mr von wogau .    2.983378572717308
we are , therefore , in agreement with the report , commissioner , as well as the broad outlines of the white paper .    4.49763145832348
since the treaty entered into force , community law on competition has been one of the tenets of community policy .    3.802490232061419
after almost forty years of being in force , these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion . for this reason , modernisation was essential .    3.4164794055064007
that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons . firstly , the authorisation system ; secondly , decentralised application ; thirdly , procedural rules ; fourthly , judicial application ; and fifthly and finally , excessive red tape .    3.319876135988723
the system of individual approvals needed urgent reform , as was unanimously requested by specialised companies , UNK and lawyers .    3.9689566753167966
i have not attended a single forum of UNK in competition law which has not requested a change to the system .    3.7594247141979324
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or UNK , is something less than a valid system .    4.518061560569054
national competition authorities were able to apply articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 for some time .    3.4079193025554755
however , they could not apply article 81 ( 3 ) , which , to a certain extent , prevented the coherent application of article 81 ( 1 ) .    3.2858057418027116
you will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the court of justice , both brought by german courts , which question the feasibility of applying 81 ( 1 ) without being able to apply 81 ( 3 ) .    3.4423406853913066
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary .    3.9238453313886326
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in regulation 1762 .    3.6410015892536287
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous .    4.061833467966307
the court of justice accepted some time ago that community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the member states and in 1994 , the commission published a communication on this subject .    4.111070787803995
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach .    2.8495715054794952
one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape .    2.926574961664616
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition , consideration of whether certain agreements are anti - competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market .    3.1087150412654196
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .    2.999529386769981
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .    3.721387508065516
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report .    2.897587417474087
amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise articles 81 and 82 , article 81 and not article 82 carries exclusive weight .    3.740877938397566
at the moment , with inter - company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them , the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important .    2.788480996746954
secondly , regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation .    3.135856646015913
for these reasons , we are going to vote in favour of the report .    3.5257353031699314
however , if some of the amendments are accepted , particularly those presented by the ppe - de group , we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document , lacking in rigour and , in that event , we would reconsider our support .    4.112764166977617
mr president , amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate , i would like to comment on the one mentioned by mr berenguer , that is to say , the modernisation of competition policy , which is the subject of the commission ' s white paper .    4.294434326001917
frankly , i believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory .    4.334652961727516
through his management , commissioner monti achieves good results , as did his predecessor and , clearly , he has established a guarantee which , in parallel with the creation and development of the european internal market , has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the union may work adequately , without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged , as has happened in the european union since 1993 .    4.492598722625347
if it functions well , if we are satisfied , if the commission has basically acted correctly , why the need for the modification ?    4.528287486531756
various arguments have been presented in its favour .    3.4967351566401534
mr berenguer made a very accurate analysis , justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition , but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the member states , are truly identical in all regions .    3.8925838001847737
because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the european internal market .    4.63581453632999
in that event we would not have moved forward , but rather backwards , in the application of competition policy in the union .    5.112318335673117
mr president , i would like firstly to express my appreciation to the commission for the improvement represented by the xxviiith report on competition policy in the union , when compared to previous reports .    3.331400001833941
i would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur , mr rapkay , who has UNK this UNK and comprehensive text in such a concise way .    3.3358339761040474
i would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the basque country , which i represent - a margin for action , by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity .    4.011862252094293
nevertheless , i cannot forget the numerous criticisms , both from member states and from market operators , which , given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the commission in its evaluation of specific cases , maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment , the planning of company mergers etc .    3.882944737063284
the only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval , through individual cases , which will take more than six or eight months to resolve , an excessively long period , which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility , affecting the generation of wealth and employment .    3.3964885881361533
i therefore believe that something is missing and i suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .    3.5439632209762824
mr president , i would like to stress that , in an age of significant technological changes - just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport - safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future .    3.456407469581572
from the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increasing employment and wealth , safeguarding a competition policy in the member states is becoming a crucial factor , and one that is certainly very important for our future .    4.146069933364213
this is why i give this report my full support .    2.867080232845526
recently , i have noticed that the commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner , precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility , both for products and for services .    4.381741763643657
i would emphasise that this is going to be extremely important for our future , for europe ' s economy , and , above all , for the protection of our wealth and technological development in europe in general .    4.682196207302602
mr president , for british conservatives the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the european union .    3.001882521281599
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined .    3.2755497741792
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete .    3.705863617930179
during my six months as a member of this parliament , i have become acutely aware of the determination of many members to drive forward what is described as the european project .    4.343806102775611
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper europe .    3.9976353229453423
but all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true european single market .    3.781155177079437
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission ' s proposals .    4.117133514203567
i should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for commissioner monti .    3.4364581651776205
we look to him as the man to root out UNK .    2.971484730669653
but he would recognise that , as for everybody else , we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination . that is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affairs , mr von wogau .    4.234373007104543
i want to congratulate him , sadly in his absence , for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side !    4.027143682902324
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support .    3.9271799003048753
so although i may not share his conclusions , i believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the commission must address .    5.138985631294744
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy .    2.5835973174182683
i know that the commission is set against this , but the potential exists .    4.125274767748852
i remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities .    3.197444756672335
i remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process .    3.035891125141834
i asked commissioner monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation .    3.9327374362352194
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court .    4.233037808469768
well , we in britain are looking to the european court at the moment .    3.9834170906827926
we find that the european court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with france at the moment , in which we have the support of the commission .    5.4134448876735615
unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point , in the UNK case , in which the british government was the defendant , it took ten years for the european court to give a ruling .    5.843554946189424
so , judicially , something needs to be done .    2.9355479603473755
i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area .    4.0051956641432485
in relation to legal certainty , i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen .    3.7015081484448955
it is important that business has legal certainty .    2.1233379407476622
i mentioned this again to commissioner monti recently .    3.6022660849983734
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers .    3.623263496442165
i must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the united kingdom .    3.4134800140690826
we all have , as it were , our histories to live with , but it is important that business has legal certainty .    3.3444329058766193
i would also ask the commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business : a cost - benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more european policy .    3.1801357166464426
i know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change .    4.501242257093989
we have been told how , currently , people ' s time is being wasted and that the changes , therefore , could be beneficial .    4.687142493644227
but i really feel that , in the circumstances , we want to know what the implications would be for business .    4.56592905118719
i would like to hear what commissioner monti has to say about that .    2.890012891445445
mr president , the european union ' s competition policy has been of central importance since european integration began .    3.0388469140106804
it is an integral part of the tension , inherent in the very concept of european integration , between solidarity and cooperation between member states , with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy , and competition , which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the european union as an entity .    4.018362558375105
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies .    3.404437736198834
we can be proud of a european competition culture , for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality .    4.194435199101213
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision .    2.742884292980906
however , we must be vigilant in the face of global operators , against whom nation - states are no longer able to impose limits .    3.48255576333895
that is why we should bear in mind what was said by the french UNK UNK UNK , who described the state of the world in terms of the economy ' s UNK of terror .    4.572102347298677
society is surrendering itself to the economy .    3.5834949682433637
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union .    3.2368023733353946
we are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers - in 1998 usd 2 400 billion was paid out in connection with take - overs - restrictive practices are being held in check , not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the usa or japan , or others , until we get the international competition law we so badly need .    3.3391990713344373
european competition policy , as we very often forget , is not just important for fair competition as such , but also for prices , growth and employment , and hence for the public .    5.105922808999865
in common with the other members , i call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned .    3.5335726825405307
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken .    2.8524070790242537
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection .    2.8641180846280143
i welcome the fact that commissioner monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the european parliament , as he does in the dialogue with non - governmental organisations , consumer protection associations and the public .    3.615030342959268
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy .    3.365612079526964
then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to european competition policy , and brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context .    4.214125161452063
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu enlargement .    3.83505526922697
emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy - and the jonckheer report makes this very clear - must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis .    4.283227536812387
at the same time , it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose , with a view to UNK the deficiencies of the market and furthering community objectives .    3.4385848481175874
a word on the white paper : the revision of articles 81 and 82 represents a change of direction in monopolies policy .    3.4481233029701914
i am opposed to this , unlike the majority of this house and indeed the majority of my own group , because i believe that , in competition policy terms , the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met , and i believe there is a threat of renationalisation .    4.416048280658123
the system currently in force creates transparency , affords enterprises legal certainty and has , without a shadow of a doubt , led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement .    3.2385537706128043
the problem of UNK highlighted by the commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system .    4.405270252950449
indeed , it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the treaty .    3.4128585622209417
mr president , i am very glad that mrs randzio - plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so .    2.8969460600951704
the UNK of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within european business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions .    3.566998651795492
for example , the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the european area was eur 1 . 4 UNK , which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last european merger boom in 1990 .    3.921398372269766
this poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which i hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .    3.630935115291297
commissioner monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the eldr group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices .    3.358495390132909
delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what mr von wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the european element , and , particularly would ask the commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that .    5.014895497908596
mr president , in the limited time i have , i would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here , in particular by mr jonckheer , who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio - economic balance in the granting of aid .    3.969580162812671
i also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of article 82 , especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration .    3.680381844076046
as a member for the basque country , i would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market .    3.9805095858033335
i say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the commission in general , and mr monti , in particular , for its persecution of the incentives to basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid .    4.704076418355033
mr president , commissioner , competition is exactly what we need .    3.3942149299813758
we need competition if there is the least unemployment , for a smooth - running healthcare system , for social justice , for high social standards , and , of course , we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest - quality products , equal market access conditions for all enterprises , and environmentally - friendly products .    3.847428422379209
in other words , we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics .    3.2786009054258987
i often have the impression , unlike the country i come from - former east germany - where economic competitiveness is UNK above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded , that very often the reverse is the case ; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics .    3.405089934969184
i say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this .    3.527917619724988
but a system cannot function in this way : it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand .    3.6498547816184606
i will give you an example : the european union was right to support the UNK steelworks in brandenburg , although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained .    3.30550781672533
but these are competitive jobs , for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany .    3.1184020015883696
anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle , by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time , would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region ' s employers that small and medium - sized enterprises are , of course , dependent on too .    3.5020504870616374
it goes without saying that that is not what the european union ' s competition policy is designed to achieve .    4.062393149712847
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre - UNK of managerial economics .    4.157573648807915
indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under - developed regions that will protect people ' s social welfare and boost purchasing power .    3.4696616180989563
mr president , ever since i was elected to this parliament in 1994 i have never witnessed a report which had such anti - irish sentiments and UNK as the jonckheer report which we are debating today .    3.3925332975078097
i would like to quote UNK from the report : " state aid per capita is highest in italy , germany and ireland . ireland clearly is in the lead when national and community regional and social funds are put together . "    3.5191947228927942
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .    3.3147292850025405
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation .    2.947899574995258
i should like to remind the member that the european union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus . this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within europe .    4.431628862375995
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .    3.594549441155539
i welcome the fact that grant aid of 40 % and a top - up of 15 % for smes for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in objective 1 regions in europe post - 2000 .    3.3305036896742095
i remind mr jonckheer that irish companies or foreign companies in ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland european marketplace .    2.948475599091026
no other member state is at such a disadvantage .    4.090590225555318
mr president , the monopolies ' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe .    2.8934678053117695
the commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies ' ban to be unsatisfactory , something i would wholeheartedly agree with .    3.1119095099210434
but opinion differs as to the solution .    3.7064497905155913
the commission ' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation .    2.8456157314364643
in other words , we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse .    4.059422151776289
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system .    3.102278429155636
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law .    3.1194131170823254
we would be changing the law to make it UNK again , which is something i consider to be unacceptable .    4.402109601900738
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions .    2.902420035566506
competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption , insofar as the provisions of article 81 ( 3 ) of the treaty on european union allow .    3.3761133083298147
the requirement to lodge applications in brussels will be dropped ; in other words , the commission will be completely in the dark in future .    3.602334579973227
this is unacceptable to my mind .    3.497962890437305
the commission ' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow - up supervision of the national authorities and member states ' courts .    4.319628707042181
this is unacceptable in my view .    2.888920131954102
it would weaken a key element of european policy .    3.2719247466396393
the change of system in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned .    4.703423728658067
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition .    3.4484921849173626
in any case , the commission ' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and UNK .    3.0178654461344703
there was no majority for this at the time .    3.480113558972251
since france laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time , it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy .    3.65146146311251
forty years on , this proposal has again been placed on the table and i am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies , to the detriment of europe ' s consumers .    4.383251368961842
i consider this to be unacceptable .    2.8138874574838098
mr president , in this important debate on competition , i am speaking this morning with particular reference to mr langen ' s document on the steel aid code .    3.821401818683026
as the court of justice recognised in 1996 , the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition - related disturbances .    3.216700321105442
indeed , several years ago , this was the conclusion of a report that i compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the european steel sector .    4.126298324612656
this is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses , even if this was in contradiction of article 4 of the ecsc treaty .    3.551641543024019
this indeed , is the aim of the sixth steel aid code , but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .    3.553204403377616
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research , development , environmental protection and cases of company closure .    3.245909772331418
in the same category of ideas , it is essential that member states fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the commission for the aid granted to their steel companies .    3.744677979837303
the commission suggests shorter deadlines .    2.803944068105466
i agree with this request .    3.3774425156338133
like the rapporteur , while i am pleased with the commission report , nonetheless i deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid .    4.125485042013764
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the code .    3.2416803121230484
in the interests of equality , either the code must be applied or it must be modified .    3.8774573916542976
finally , and in conclusion , mr president , with the expiry of the ecsc treaty , the regulations will have to be reviewed since i think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002 , and in that case i am in favour of a council regulation which will ensure security in this area .    4.781265717298043
we therefore await , and i await , the european commission ' s proposals on this matter .    4.416506327625569
mr president , i am also going to refer to the report by mr langen , which concerns aid to the steel industry .    3.610582946551159
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues .    3.1473230721920222
we agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that , despite the rules laid down in the sixth steel aid code , the commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that code .    3.630765194754192
however , the thing that worries us most , mr president , is the decrease in prices , by 30 % , owing to imports .    3.6937515506748033
the reason for this decrease is unfair competition from south korea and UNK , in the case of steel , as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid .    3.626476861053282
orders in the steel industry and the ship - building industry - we also spoke about this a while ago - have decreased drastically , resulting in a loss of jobs .    3.297600012771461
i live in a region where the ship - building industry now has very serious problems : UNK .    3.3585817584592568
with global markets , we need global employment laws and global subsidies .    3.919319846368559
i know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve jobs in europe and outside it .    3.961283979601294
mr president , commissioner , director - general , i would particularly like to emphasise the following in relation to the von wogau report : i welcome the commission ' s open - minded endeavours to initiate debate on the hitherto strict procedural rules , and to propose practical reform measures .    3.753115562836766
i congratulate the rapporteur karl von wogau , who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification , indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken , and UNK no UNK when it comes to the problems currently under discussion .    3.3111262165655577
the white paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection , discussion , and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves , the judiciary , the member states , and above all the smes concerned , that need to be clarified .    3.710948605978473
competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be UNK because this would jeopardise the internal market and europe as a business location in a global economy .    4.077568051137706
however , it must be " UNK " taking into account the principle of subsidiarity .    3.5345476127526436
i also welcome , therefore , the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual , without the commission giving up any of its responsibility .    4.212573188990358
in practice , only 9 cases were rejected , 94 % of the cases that the commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of UNK , non - legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines , which clearly shows that the work of the commission is subject to time - related , staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and eu enlargement    4.214115763640225
to conclude , i would like to tell you what i am expecting from this reform : fair competition and equal competition conditions , legal certainty for all enterprises , consistent application of competition policy , procedural simplification according to the principle of the one - stop - shop , coordination of the national - and to me , independent - competition authorities , close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the commission , along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of european competition and monopolies law , and i expect the commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the UNK of its tasks as the UNK guardian of the european competition policies .    4.450770414839417
i am in UNK as to how the discussions , which were broadly based , will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal .    4.662460758052043
the commission report confirms that , with the exception of germany , state aid to businesses is increasing .    3.5298258295132507
the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition .    3.027635298621148
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .    3.6627285222628108
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business .    3.394523809342973
take , for example , the car manufacturing sector , where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24 % during the reference period .    3.1856053346782582
with what aim ?    3.7416119348689576
not to save jobs .    3.256782666171443
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .    2.9388953562784
not to improve working conditions , for in increasing production with fewer workers , working conditions are made worse .    3.2224956479527336
did these firms need state aid to survive ?    3.856756023476501
no , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .    3.0800140007328065
state aid is not only counterproductive because , as the jonckheer report acknowledges , it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another , but it is unacceptable because it UNK public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders .    4.146595029035277
in voting against the jonckheer report , i wish to assert the need for another policy , to wit , UNK all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff .    3.8117319169818424
mr president , today ' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market .    3.3625640314763725
in accordance with the principle of competition , the legislation has implemented articles 85 to 94 , competition policy in the strict sense , and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition .    3.7160717644906236
this has worked fairly well , but , as in the famous film UNK ' time goes by ' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances .    4.4339140568176525
in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions .    3.2861656568583757
firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .    4.563754909882162
it is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory UNK and rules that only lay down UNK legal concepts .    3.7322878928358367
this is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities .    3.6581469240465507
thirdly , it seems to me important that the commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the commission , in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies .    3.692932220376038
fourthly , and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed .    3.412564397687275
we have seen this in the UNK seattle conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .    4.518742655660005
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application .    3.5690549253670487
we must monitor compliance with environmental standards , employment standards , in order to prevent dumping in this area , and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid , which in many industries - as has already been said - UNK competition and destroys jobs within our own territory . to sum up , we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid , internal distortions by other countries , from being transferred to the international arena , in other words , through UNK .    4.043116450698863
mr president , commissioner monti , there is much that is good in mr jonckheer ' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors .    3.2674215226181733
first of all the report reveals parliament ' s single - minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions UNK .    4.407444846035257
many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .    4.50611713972517
for example , the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from member state to member state reveals the need for surveys such as this .    3.68131723788468
aid that is based on the self - seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages , thus UNK competition and leading to an ineffective , UNK division of europe ' s meagre resources .    3.601921679919093
the form the aid takes is important .    3.4727638939824113
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported .    4.467847204442853
for example , state guarantees , on which the commission has just publicised its position , must naturally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion , a better option than granting aid directly to companies .    4.013793791513597
the report on competition policy further stresses the commission ' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency , which affects competitiveness .    3.4016049504611265
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets .    3.9666234586530327
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy , real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream .    4.379398576974875
competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non - material rights : we should not just be emphasising its social dimension .    4.949305730408763
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth , not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy .    4.034477377793729
mr rapkay ' s report also emphasises the importance of the international dimension with regard to competition law .    4.614161811873523
in my opinion , it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law .    3.125182927388927
aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator , which will water down all the aims of competition policy .    3.6330622579359964
mr president , mr monti , the reform of competition rules calls for a commitment by the european union , not only in the light and as a consequence of changes which have taken place through the years , but also with a forward - looking view to the union ' s enlargement .    4.738646516563593
moreover , i would like to say that i appreciate the remarks and observations that professor UNK , chairman of the italian competition authority , sent me , and which i am sure mr monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration .    3.6312814798536523
our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market , and , above all , to achieve consistency between the different national markets . as things stand , there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the english , italian and french markets .    3.8070418125223653
there is a large degree of state protectionism in the french market which is not found in the english market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in italy .    3.663657542767159
another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement , which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment .    3.248054279574346
safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade , pure and simple , and a system for improving people ' s quality of life .    4.49516532647335
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .    3.7373650795540825
we ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with russia and the mediterranean countries , precisely so that their economies become less peripheral .    3.055168535059888
i hope - and i thank mr monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed .    4.247619819455465
mr president , competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force .    3.5622597986039497
a free and open market can only exist by the UNK of competition , marked by clear , uniform rules .    3.99710824344931
but europe is changing .    3.584976263436075
the economies are growing , we are enlarging to 25 - 30 member states .    3.8396592142997346
the european commission will become UNK if it UNK its current policy .    3.6528315503717965
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy .    2.6338692418602094
this is not in question .    2.9868541006459184
having said this , i still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation .    3.011187957302514
how will the commission , as keeper of the treaties , guarantee that decisions are taken UNK in matters of competition in london , UNK , helsinki and , soon , budapest and ankara ?    4.146226763153743
this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented , and issues of competition will UNK towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given .    3.637393268169933
it is not enough to say that , in the member states , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .    4.5114652574082434
the european commission ' s belief that , in all quarters of the union , legislation will , almost as a matter of course , be interpreted in the same way , is what , within catholic circles , we term " UNK , " and this is not allowed .    4.574497893380731
uniformity needs to be worked on .    4.621683000724709
think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court .    3.459859414339655
this special court in luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise .    4.002885295445144
moreover , due to the immense economic and social interests involved , we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event , as is now quite normal .    4.120116109117547
in order to grant small and medium - sized companies greater security , the european commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium - sized businesses so that , alongside vertical exemptions , horizontal exemptions will also be possible .    3.6743082780431284
through cooperation , small , independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains .    3.8985091198680197
it cannot be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses .    4.198950916857511
moreover , regarding these small businesses , we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in , the UNK card , instead of an immediate red card , which will be a large fine and will threaten the company ' s very existence .    4.173083376557301
mr president , being the last to speak gives me the privilege , commissioner , of telling you that the majority of this house supports your initiative and has expressed a total , and , i believe , justified , confidence in you at the helm of this boat . but we all want to be UNK on it .    4.270891975001367
we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you .    3.131193859797253
i therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform .    3.654797638024956
the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories .    3.6188180491468134
firstly , there is the concern that some have expressed , in particular mrs randzio - plath , president of the committee on economic affairs , of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the treaty .    4.1498125582078575
secondly , we have the issue of companies ' legal certainty .    4.061356137404982
it is true , commissioner , that the commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty .    3.8163125923302164
we all agree on this .    2.676563417026026
but it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this house - that the european industrial fabric is composed of small and medium - sized businesses , and that the commission often plays the role of UNK , of legitimising the nature of the internal market .    4.389099047919227
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr karas said .    3.4663611531106495
there have only been nine UNK .    2.830922842530668
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .    4.324492890977211
how often has a lawyer with two companies and one project , in the face of a commission guideline given ex ante , changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules !    3.896728419838181
this is therefore an aspect to be considered .    3.3287240277564587
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of community law .    3.24659023428293
in this respect , the excellent speech by mrs thyssen cannot be improved upon .    2.9186107146870106
i believe that biodiversity is good , as is cultural diversity , but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market , that is to say , competition law .    4.222264199657927
here improvements should be made .    3.8214823987264674
only in certain countries , germany for example , is there specialised jurisdiction .    3.70932974883082
perhaps this is a promising UNK to explore , but we must also explore others .    3.894319112279104
what we cannot do , commissioner - and i would like to end on this note - is to give way , and give ammunition , to those who regard the european institutions as the property of the great and the good , of the rich , and not of the citizen , or the small and medium business , which , in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements , very late , with no real possibility of control apart from what the french call " le UNK du UNK " , that is to say , after lord knows how many years , when the court in luxembourg passes judgement , a court which we know to be inundated at the moment .    3.98615847006795
commissioner , it is impossible to UNK the importance of this reform .    4.58741665250359
it transcends competition , it transcends the cohesion of the internal market . i believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of european integration , the meaning of the legitimacy of european integration .    3.9431582258462416
therefore , commissioner , we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation .    3.9084397347559285
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i heartily congratulate the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the entire european parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition - related subjects .    3.1413878795459365
in my opinion , mr president , this joint debate fully bears this out .    3.5106891310046775
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order .    3.6775968495895097
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy , a pillar of the social market economy and of european construction .    4.026602044332054
the guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy , which we shall have the opportunity to address together , aims to ensure more effective protection of competition , reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision - making processes closer to the european people .    4.404306723748541
i , personally , would sincerely like to thank mr von wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the white paper and for the quality of his report .    3.8707077040816764
i would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups . i do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the commission , but , on the contrary , fundamental contributions , since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome .    3.6229005604164692
the groups are : the efficiency of the rules , the risk of renationalisation , consistent application of the rules and legal certainty . i will take these very quickly one at a time .    4.851369025898163
efficiency : i am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it .    4.099743236289226
the current notification instrument , ladies and gentlemen , no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - i would remind you that , in 35 years , there have only been nine cases in which the commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which , in the majority of cases , receive a simple comfort letter .    3.956140460480543
the proposed system will improve the protection of competition , primarily because it will allow the commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions , also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in UNK out infringements , and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges , whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals .    4.069084736781389
the question of renationalisation : first of all , although it is not really necessary , i would like to point out and stress , several times if i may , that the white paper does not affect mergers or state aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that , as far as regulation 17 is concerned , there is a risk of renationalisation .    4.598123318268246
of course we have UNK this issue , and we are still studying it extremely carefully , and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced .    4.606063059875807
at the end of the day , i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified .    3.1867991942637444
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .    3.1910574310605093
the reform does not entail any reduction in the commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .    4.099571448653547
the reform will lead to a gradual development - i stress this because i was particularly taken with this term , used by mrs randzio - plath , and , moreover , i fully agree with it - of european competition culture .    3.9663943175402463
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being UNK and taking root in the european competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .    4.465235996173839
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned , permitting greater use of community law , which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply .    3.4058338584343164
allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation , not renationalisation , of competition law .    3.7391431681636234
the question of consistent application : the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind , but i do not believe that it should be exaggerated .    4.294489578078658
as with many other provisions of the treaty , articles 81 ( 1 ) and 82 have , after all , been applied for decades by national authorities and judges , and i do not feel that this has created serious problems .    4.033194119990792
in a directly applicable exception system , consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules .    3.0232338484362318
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework , both through general provisions and through its decision - making practice .    3.2946018443903067
secondly , we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes , and the white paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation .    4.368166044191302
in this respect , i would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs riis - jørgensen and mr huhne of monitoring implementation .    2.8889188898327207
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation .    3.954926592104543
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up .    3.9770793287851967
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on , it is evident that we will watch very carefully how ec law is applied by national authorities and courts .    4.782161979033106
that is why the commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application .    3.8235757155879346
this goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns , mrs peijs .    3.3955135267240717
concerning mr evans ' point regarding the implications for businesses , it is important that the cost - benefit analysis should be seriously conducted .    3.9558319558366755
the purpose of publishing the white paper is , after all , to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources .    4.058710527416733
we have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost - benefit assessment for business .    3.464939404800321
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation .    3.6040549698240825
there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance . this was raised by mrs thyssen , mrs peijs and mrs palacio vallelersundi : the issue of smes .    3.6164299214233666
many speakers have underlined this .    3.2554519206225137
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes .    3.076448236991434
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes .    3.138987383471349
why ?    3.878987120302772
is this simply a political gesture ?    3.2788596587133325
no .    3.2985442425100673
in the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most smes will be covered by block exemption regulations , as in the field of vertical restraints .    3.5598889237068194
most smes have in fact less than 30 % of the market share .    4.315233826053145
we have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since smes are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under article 81 ( 1 ) .    3.05227018024001
we are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of smes , and our white paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of smes , first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system , and secondly , by making article 81 ( 3 ) directly applicable , which will benefit smes in particular .    3.4379950616198833
the fourth group is legal certainty .    3.1811122557283604
mr evans , legal certainty is , of course - and i am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses , not just for the legal professions , although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of europe .    4.307380190202111
legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the chair of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , mrs palacio vallelersundi , emphasised in her last intervention - and i am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .    3.8288453373564297
i am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons : by virtue of the direct effect of article 81 ( 3 ) , it will permit authorisation , without a prior decision , of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions ; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions ; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty .    3.5021024833530254
( fr ) mrs thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers .    3.2986207991375545
let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than i . this ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any UNK thereof .    3.6222431017034142
the white paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re - examined : the exchange of confidential information .    3.724958121141601
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion .    3.522814561082873
( it ) i shall now quickly turn , mr president , to mr rapkay ' s report , and i would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the commission ' s xxviiith annual report on competition policy .    4.276535992820031
we share the same basic views but the rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully .    3.306794913478078
i will mention only two , in order to be brief .    3.3716824217820944
the first is greater transparency .    2.9529544911156336
parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy , as i did right from the moment i had my hearing , on 1 september , in the committee on economic and monetary affairs .    4.301556843578553
mr jonckheer , i would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union .    3.2693274574661966
i will not talk about codecision here , but this certainly does not mean i do not consider it important .    4.166665180497928
it has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition ; i am therefore not qualified to give an opinion , and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the intergovernmental conference .    3.649997861473507
with regard to your suggestions , mr jonckheer , you already know that my staff , who , although short - handed as usual , are fortunately highly qualified , are working hard to produce the register of state aids and the state aids ' scoreboard ' .    3.329697590888163
i am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey , which , according to the scheduled timeframe , should be being drawn up by the staff now , in january , and for adoption by the commission in march 2000 , to see whether the latest trends are confirmed .    4.521902666487728
mr jonckheer , mrs thyssen and mr UNK raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of state aid .    4.49153532108194
i can only say very briefly , that we are actively working with them on a practical level : they are making preparations , they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities .    3.6356644648639374
i can also say , in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which , as you know , i share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental state aid .    4.610417518127864
in connection with the issue of state aid , i would also like to take up one of the points raised by mrs riis - jørgensen , among others regarding repayment of illegal aid .    4.55559669723344
in april 1999 , the commission adopted new rules of procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment .    3.9266405284310246
finally , mr president , i would like to thank mr langen warmly for his report , which , although geared more towards a specific sector , is a valuable contribution .    3.727107145913644
i would like to say that , as we know , the commission report on state aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure , pursuant to article 95 of the ecsc treaty , but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector .    3.475141451079259
in respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector , which will come into force in july 2002 , we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied , and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this .    4.52418978689307
when we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form , i will be happy to present our viewpoint to you .    3.897185652182984
so , mr president , i will walk away from this debate , for which i am very grateful to parliament , in the knowledge that we have the european parliament ' s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the house , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .    4.6825246803761305
i am especially grateful for all of this .    3.739696528491202
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs , and , at a more general level , with parliament .    4.180471186213419
in this regard , i liked your term , mrs palacio vallelersundi : we must all pull together , UNK in the same direction .    3.4755597006455914
competition is not an end in itself , as mr rapkay rightly pointed out , but it plays an extremely important role in european integration .    4.072119092754593
i would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social , as well as economic , role in the european integration process , as it has done in the past .    3.942876920480631
thank you , commissioner monti .    2.6536932161397067
the joint debate is closed .    2.6217336641448776
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.5924185258399082
protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests    3.7361576836204775
the next item is the report ( a5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mrs theato , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , containing parliament ' s recommendations to the commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests .    3.0438621209275976
mr president , year after year we learn , mainly from the european court of auditors ' test reports , that money is lost to the budget of the european union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage , mismanagement , and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud .    3.289789595253742
for some time now , these abuses have meant that parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the european taxpayer ' s money , which , when all is said and done , is what sustains the union ' s budget .    3.6388999903159727
particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud , to detecting it , punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening .    3.800153189936225
creating uclaf by means of the task force and setting up the anti - fraud office olaf were important steps , as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the community and on local monitoring .    3.8001733941488203
the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed .    3.35531693045783
so far , efforts on the part of the commission to ask for UNK obtained money to be returned only had limited success .    3.6652274965825096
it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures .    3.6948634271093668
since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross - border violations against the union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the member states .    3.534130824310775
what is more , the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the european council in 1995 did nothing to change this .    3.621119138802235
for it to enter into force , it must be ratified by all 15 member states .    4.119851606231671
after five years only four have done so .    3.317819211036256
this state of deadlock , which threatens to undermine the credibility of the union , has inspired parliament to initiate the setting - up of a european public prosecutor ' s office .    3.217305185850829
there is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority , rather the aim is to equip the union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests , that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity .    3.925022135063741
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised .    3.8299083696167466
the concerns of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as UNK in its position , together with those of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , will also be taken full account of in this process .    3.2517593394096247
we would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .    4.109662885030565
in addition , we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the union ' s financial interests , and in which main principles are firmly established .    3.5733258430346537
i support the proposed deadline for the commission being 30 september in a proposed amendment .    3.720000404899566
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings .    2.788640585856556
the commission ought - and i have also amended this deadline to 31 may 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the commission , for coordinating and UNK the legal investigative body olaf .    4.165862701254652
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency .    2.9911485881037874
the proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks , which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by olaf into activities which are to the detriment of the union ' s financial interests , and to olaf ' s relationship with the national authorities .    3.5178729776746294
the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts .    3.5320284405581415
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so - called five wise men .    3.9258522293037106
the commission , mr barnier , mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to the idea .    3.910525127298475
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to vote in favour of this report , which the committee on budgetary control adopted with a large majority .    3.649594100196558
we can set another example here , to the effect that parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular , fraud , and to UNK out punishment where necessary .    4.729152306190672
mr president , i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato .    4.4583634816153905
i believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well , and the result , which we have received today , is moderate and UNK in a very delicate area .    4.736566437519957
this moderation and UNK is particularly necessary in the implementation of article 280 ( 4 ) .    3.665419714232069
if we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand , least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought . the treaty is a collection of complex articles .    3.555577812567721
however , this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm UNK to win such a prize .    3.496117624295257
at the same time , it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the community ' s financial interests , as mrs theato has explained very well .    3.1897966684589383
we are all aware - and this parliament has been the UNK champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the community . but be careful .    5.180244850652109
as the french say , " UNK UNK pas le UNK UNK UNK ' UNK du UNK " [ let us not throw the baby out with the UNK water ] , that is to say , in the protection of the community ' s financial interests , we must respect , on the one hand - as mrs theato has said - the competences of the member states , but also other matters which affect the citizens , which affect the essential guarantees .    4.5357082406623555
the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them perfectly .    3.100337687194377
therefore , in my capacity as president of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , and , of course , as an mep , i hope that a large majority of this house will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the commission .    4.307202954110041
mr president , this , as mrs theato said , is a critical report .    4.207431346765756
it is a report that has been proposed by the committee on budgetary control and it is an own - initiative report .    4.004255827635446
one of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because , whether we like it or not , the european union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement . it is sometimes exaggerated but there it is .    3.5556199187218738
we need to do something about it .    2.7273755601705196
some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the member states - and let us not forget that the member states are responsible for implementing about 80 % of the eu budget .    4.99648858252576
a lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the convention on the protection of financial interests , and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done .    3.755198177742705
we need to take this responsibility seriously .    3.387409998913362
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union .    3.159342986799205
the question is : who UNK ?    3.239666490142325
that is where we really get into difficulty .    3.1741179039337064
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that UNK so many frontiers ?    3.525763579622511
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of member states .    3.8513898760294847
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one .    3.5613157542026763
we are all aware that an all - out federal approach and a situation where a european judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people .    3.2127172584407577
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions .    4.352600979439638
of most importance to parliament , as the guardian of the budget of the european union , is how to deal with people who work within the european union institutions .    5.039993066986463
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal .    3.3797672187580594
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted , and that is not the case at the moment .    4.36768688024018
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio .    4.7058158368050345
i should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the commission should tackle this question .    3.8630757784592253
we are aware that it is a delicate debate .    3.895510468400089
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties .    3.8828542389881564
can i just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here , no commitment to a federal european public prosecutor .    3.5743775190834084
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable .    3.612650529757473
mr president , i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report .    2.2484442876488315
i think it is a first - class report which will , for the most part , be supported by my group .    3.984072643857349
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage .    3.1433514305837496
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months , this could well be the case .    4.002666028046469
we all know that , in 1995 , it was agreed that the union ' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law .    3.864071761650825
but the member states failed to cooperate .    3.9562534820615394
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present , i think .    3.9283212981854057
it is now possible , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , that the commission will take new initiatives , and i would like to suggest to the commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .    3.7828803332737855
unlike the previous speaker , who has now disappeared , my group is strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor .    3.94960741520001
my colleague jan - UNK UNK , will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter .    3.9659570863424127
i think what we need is , at european level , to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible .    3.5063318118553797
i myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic .    4.400796409245631
this , i thought , is no longer permissible , certainly not at the moment .    3.7510235128403573
i would like to make one general point on politics . whatever we may say about the european elections , the low turnout is a fact .    3.3693383753641375
we can improve on this by punishing crime in europe quickly , and this must be done at european level .    3.7567537802188995
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur .    2.387396929949026
mrs theato ' s report may help to restore confidence in european institutions .    3.462117713607559
i believe that is something we are all desperately in need of , bearing in mind the results of the last european elections and of the level of turnout .    4.485081191676598
yet , every year we have the same problem .    3.8168588276464
the court of auditors UNK its report , which UNK the member states on account of various incidences of fraud .    4.064576528449919
so far , however , the european institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here , to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied .    4.0901924412005055
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year .    2.843002647753497
i believe that mrs theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the european institutions take steps to ensure that european money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here .    3.8061515975597686
it is important that after the first step , which has already been taken , i . e . forming olaf from uclaf - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for olaf , in order that olaf too might operate within a secure legal framework .    3.616751515100707
we will need the european public prosecutor ' s office for this , which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees , also for UNK .    4.258010944864427
having said all that , i must say that unfortunately , my group will not be voting for your report as a united front .    4.105691263100063
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people .    3.063357741138864
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity .    4.149623059906707
but i will do what i can to see that mrs theato ' s report receives more support .    4.066252609846471
mr president , we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled , even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by parliament to the council to amend the treaties , so that effective protection under criminal law of the union ' s financial interests can be guaranteed .    4.448428007523208
the establishment of a european public prosecutor ' s office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the union is doubtless a good idea , but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a european legal system .    3.4454807995929535
indeed , we are talking about criminal law , the area where resistance that national states put up to communitisation is , and will be , UNK .    4.073142280735117
indeed , it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a european legal system .    3.451981915501936
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are .    3.551204865265427
in any case , this idea must be encouraged , and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a community corpus iuris in the treaties .    3.6559462955529067
on behalf of my group , but also personally , i hope that the vital financial spirit of the union will pave the way for the creation of a european legal system which respects citizens ' rights and guarantees , which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto UNK in many states .    4.223867035070559
therefore , on behalf of my group , i would like to say that we support the theato report ; i nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the igc agenda .    3.9384941221578393
mr president , mrs theato ' s report on the protection of the european union ' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a european public prosecutor .    3.017639765923009
this proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state .    3.7878305762032642
but the idea of a european public prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters .    3.4295754129839904
moreover , this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally UNK reforms .    3.2823232222121197
according to the theato report , the european public prosecutor is needed , in particular , in order to better support the inquiries of the anti - fraud office , olaf .    4.390676017007655
at the same time , however , we see from the van hulten report under discussion today that the european public prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a european union court .    4.022737037904488
in this way , a small european reform may hide a medium - sized one , and a medium - sized one may hide a large one .    3.5266939009874836
not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one , as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a european criminal law and then , why not a european minister of justice , supervised by an extension of the powers of the european parliament ?    4.391782743079139
i therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform , which appears to be quite specific .    3.8349915015450518
in the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a european public prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form , organised around a superstate .    3.3369467728870856
the union for a europe of nations group , on the other hand , wishes to see a polycentric europe with nations linked in a network .    2.959015308861456
so the legal framework , mr president , is already in place .    4.898292541029849
it is fine , in principle .    3.5496921761845956
mr president , mrs theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason .    2.6918958356360014
public opinion , although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows , is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution : a european criminal code with crimes against the community and a european prosecutor - general .    3.3765353834546765
mrs theato probably forgot to include a european prison now that we have the fbi , the european police , in the form of olaf .    4.731411145779479
all this would be established by two regulations , one for the public prosecutor and another for the criminal code . the regulations would be adopted pursuant to article 280 of the treaty , i . e . based on secondary law , whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible .    3.5476956856986748
and indeed there is a twofold shift .    4.387856851667966
firstly , the classic eurofederalist ideological shift , a single market , a single vat , a single diplomatic service , a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor .    3.524812172200961
all this to combat fraud worth less than eur 1 billion , while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the generalised system of preferences , free trade areas , customs presents to UNK and the billions lost to the fourth resource , gdp , as a result of the budgetary UNK pact .    3.2320898899633392
next we have the UNK shift : the UNK europe of the north , the europe of the UNK , UNK and UNK , wishes to inflict its moral order on us .    4.561945535191211
basically , the more we lose our grip on morals , the more we tighten our grip on our UNK .    3.280954944780144
mr president , it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union , more so these days than there used to be .    3.6332609292172475
the fraud and corruption scandals of the past have had a profoundly damaging effect on the confidence of europe ' s citizens .    4.362140614928857
the credibility of the efforts we make here in parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future .    3.0964367290673236
this does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes ; in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law .    3.0778340924966177
the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .    3.7792219474053796
now it is , of course , possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the member states and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity .    3.8925270550406825
there is no doubt that i myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at european level .    3.624117042800128
when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear UNK of competences that should take centre stage .    3.8404996637841307
now that is not a contradiction , since the demand for an instrument of criminal law and criminal proceedings law , as detailed in recommendations i and ii of the report , is actually about taking action in the eu ' s own interests , which , as far as that goes , does not damage the legal interests of the member states ; on the contrary , it protects them , at least indirectly .    4.757161564118725
the compatibility with the various national systems of law , as confirmed by experts , shows that criminal law is another area where europe has a great deal in common , for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned .    4.268268188374048
taking these aspects into account , i consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind , as proposed , and i also consider it necessary to the further development of olaf .    4.663235188596353
mr president , will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish UNK fraud involving eu funds ?    3.796454383507502
on the other hand , we can go a long way using the existing tools .    3.1604746706737736
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust , as proposed at the last summit .    4.3996036054977905
in the way it is structured , eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes .    3.0879995580479855
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for .    3.418473873977503
olaf , europol and the treaty on UNK and mutual assistance in criminal matters should be used fully and , when the fraud convention from 1995 is at long last ratified in the member states , we can also achieve a lot with this .    4.398429782384571
i nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most member states should still not have ratified this agreement .    4.146676014297994
it is simply too bad , and i can well understand why people are becoming UNK and demanding that we have a common european public prosecutor ' s office instead .    4.007464165995205
however , it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office .    3.3616225699332656
it is , after all , only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law . UNK per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence .    3.4098000826752557
instead , there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily .    3.6000250693291296
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and , especially , change our practice .    3.121143736236573
at the moment , article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used .    2.969346541403216
should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we UNK into constructing grand new institutions !    3.2497978894157207
mr president , we all want to do something about combating european fraud .    3.3447649055726267
but the question is now : is the european union doing anything about it as well ?    4.295544180719129
the answer to this is that we know very little about this .    4.442718995701698
the tampere summit was about combating crime .    2.8017706611995923
there is no european anti - fraud legislation in force because the member states , as was stated before , have not ratified the treaty texts submitted .    3.65952992530412
so a great deal has to be done in this area .    4.3930505288235855
and what exactly should be done ?    3.778412534241775
two things , and mrs theato ' s report clearly spells these out .    3.5912217708597662
firstly , the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud must apply in all member states of the european union .    2.999870675288346
so , unification in this small area .    3.080886276480832
secondly , we should indeed set up a european public prosecutor ' s office with two tasks , firstly to assist the national public prosecutors , helping bring criminal proceedings in european fraud cases and , secondly , to supervise europol and olaf in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision .    3.3351951376577906
the european public prosecutor ' s office is nothing to be afraid of .    3.2696294241232446
i feel there is a lot of UNK going on .    3.731968904231979
it is , in fact , something very positive .    3.164514060113863
just like europol . europol , involving police cooperation , does not UNK above the national police forces , but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces .    3.683197800489318
this is exactly the task which a small , limited , european public prosecutor ' s office should carry out , not just at the criminal investigation stage , but also at the prosecution stage .    3.4172362438777095
parliament supports this .    3.472005130472838
the committee of wise men supports this .    2.9048740135611975
i urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same .    3.8875658114713816
mr president , i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris .    3.039532591279603
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue .    2.9252367637372294
corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation .    4.063367417910467
the idea of a european public prosecutor on the continental UNK model with overriding jurisdiction throughout eu territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in ireland and the uk .    3.208311297389759
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about .    4.38651153922631
indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the eu budget .    3.821125110507479
but when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in san UNK - to a very select UNK of 140 jurists , with no media invited - the president of the european parliament at the time , mr gil - robles gil - UNK , said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend eu competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity .    3.9507883417905325
we need a public debate on this .    3.4473263351399224
we need the member states and the citizens in the member states to be properly informed .    4.268980756207352
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed .    3.332766304747159
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .    4.670617581291795
it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member states of the eu without any proper public debate .    3.9413173836791824
mr president , on behalf of the italian radical members , i abstained on this text in the committee on budgetary control , because i share the concerns that have been voiced , in such an authoritative way , by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important : common law .    3.7773695347742073
with this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue , since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for community fraud to be UNK , to be crushed .    5.322465998916037
nevertheless , the way in which our committee intends to see this text through , with the drive and UNK desire of its chair , mrs theato , will not be without its critics .    4.25375198664089
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law .    3.664602386152025
article 280 of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud .    3.7987046286218997
nevertheless , we are left feeling slightly UNK that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality , without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this . that is to say , they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system .    3.9573225918658164
we wanted to express our UNK as regards these points by abstaining in committee .    3.7753667919633234
mr president , we need to speak our minds on this subject in the european parliament , during the plenary sittings and in the committees , even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture , the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed .    4.342042642951318
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events , which in the past seemed to be the norm .    4.35973184190727
today , something has changed , at least in terms of mechanisms , and especially as regards monitoring , but we are still not satisfied , particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a european public prosecutor , crimes , fraud , the UNK of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one ' s office at european level .    4.134953325751981
i feel that we must clearly safeguard the community ' s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of community life .    3.699063970818724
for this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual states .    4.033511503276063
in this respect , we are faced with the most sensitive issue : what role would a european public prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems ?    3.6679201611272156
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms .    3.506142850004254
today , we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country .    2.8637594560715267
mr president , i would very much just like to add to two particular points .    3.0169181031572725
firstly , i would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of member states , although i am very much in favour of having such a debate , for my regular viewing of british television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are UNK up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home - grown legal system .    3.8013304296751733
sometimes it is worthy of UNK and merits discussion , but i UNK .    4.740681699937923
the point i want to make relates to mrs theato ' s report .    3.1024197714291453
i believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here - and the european union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences UNK as european criminal offences - we have become UNK in UNK .    4.393845433190484
i am referring to recommendations 1 and 2 .    2.8949556693183
after all , there is no longer mention of a european public prosecutor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , european authority , or " body " to quote mrs theato .    3.6496600233080607
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .    3.6711627192783576
we also face difficulties with regard to offences .    3.8633796271416463
nothing has changed there .    3.3181323932812514
as has always been the case , there are offences that transcend european offences , as it were , or at least there is the potential for them to do so , and these might include money - laundering , receiving UNK goods , and forming a criminal organisation .    3.8691188146692728
as far as that is concerned , i believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome .    3.5732127974419994
what parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though - and this is why we intend to vote for recital 1 without these recommendations - is to send out a clear political signal to the commission and council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this UNK state of affairs .    3.8040131494446343
the proposals in mrs theato ' s report seek to encourage the commission to present a substantive legislative measure on the protection , under criminal law , of our financial interests , which would criminalise certain activity , specifically fraud against the community budget . these proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently - needed uniform criminal law for the whole community .    4.010009169773484
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by olaf , without UNK the administration of justice by each member state and under the supervision of the european court of justice .    3.7565329134380696
finally , following on from what was agreed in tampere , the report UNK the need for a european public prosecutor . this issue has been brought once again to the fore by commissioner vitorino ' s timely decision to ask the igc to include in its agenda the creation of this new role , which everyone considers vital .    4.1621950715560265
we should approve this report because it highlights the need to maintain efficient legal control over our institutions , by protecting the union ' s financial system with a substantive and procedural european law which is capable of maintaining the credibility of the community ' s economic life .    3.663678976684009
nevertheless , it raises some very basic questions .    2.8966166148679044
is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically community - wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the member states ?    4.097898806159979
as there are doubts , would it not be more advisable , from a political point of view , to put the reform of the legal system on the igc agenda , and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the union ' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the european public prosecutor ?    4.673470325604192
surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom , security and justice ?    3.4395894824431714
mr president , the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny .    3.1939823765265296
confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged .    4.202773463143782
to remedy this , vigorous efforts are required .    3.3040250246563265
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently .    3.1250249017234197
at the same time , we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the eu must be able to be held accountable in an effective way .    3.987476465831059
it is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the union ' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few member states .    3.5035962445246245
we therefore think it only right that the commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework .    3.6398663713890906
on the other hand , i am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common european legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime .    3.532560163923511
in the present situation , i am therefore sceptical about the idea of a european prosecutor , which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty .    4.60803153258332
we have more confidence in eurojust , where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate .    2.9700879165710714
the major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the union but , rather , that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered .    3.583597431276442
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is , however , to find the right mix .    4.724645493664967
the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old - fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which , through an exaggerated supervision of detail , prevents the development of a modern administration .    3.4097863446742576
we therefore welcome the aggressive approach of mr van hulten ' s report .    2.5742076621335452
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision .    3.653551287144321
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness , decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision .    2.9845740264068406
the major challenge is , therefore , to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law .    3.3552870728669877
this requires staff training , more modern recruitment methods and , above all , openness and public control .    3.1439159722560825
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities .    3.904490654113918
mr president , rapporteur , restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the european institutions and in european politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us .    3.896577484881131
the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this .    3.2251642703248216
parliament is committed to this task , which is something this report bears impressive witness to .    3.8479991765948154
on behalf of the commission i am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do , in terms of creating legal bases and UNK institutional change , to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the european union .    3.7276877993750097
on ratifying the amsterdam treaty , all member states stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the european union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment .    3.6815747848339324
yet as things stand , only the first four member states have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995 .    3.6224895208040797
the commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation    4.80516778049265
a legislative act , a directive , in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money - laundering or UNK , and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective , may enable us to take a major step forwards , and i will therefore advise the commission to examine this step with all due haste .    4.770628235470784
olaf , the european anti - fraud office is one of the most important instruments the commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud .    4.12192240087406
accordingly , the commission refused to put up with the fact that both european banks , the ecb and the UNK , contested the right of olaf to include these two institutions in its investigations , UNK their independent status .    4.4737562363187555
this is why the commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting , and i hope that parliament approves this step .    3.1342549799971935
the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions .    3.3029068246446487
it is the task of the monitoring committee for olaf , which was set up at the same time as olaf , to safeguard the independence of olaf , however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by olaf .    3.733284237640425
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point .    3.9455591420844667
in other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and i will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .    4.260331417179339
there is one thing i would ask though : i believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for olaf from leading to the UNK that olaf does not now have enough authority .    4.193326080895664
no , there must be no undermining of olaf ' s authority , and neither do i think this was the rapporteur ' s intention .    4.259015851231603
as such , i would ask you to give olaf ' s work your full support , also in its present form .    3.5578773938195596
thank you , commissioner schreyer .    2.2989853818138406

heaton - harris ( ppe - de ) .    3.4532016754695793
mr president , on a point of order i should like to ask you for clarification of the rules of procedure : namely rules UNK ( 2 ) and UNK ( 4 ) . these are both about voting .    3.344667679807588
is it not the case that on votes other than roll - call votes , the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then , if there is some doubt , should we utilise the electronic voting system ?    3.4731714813275505
that is quite right , mr heaton - harris . i put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call .    3.236338430615763
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it .    3.1098178401027416
in this particular case , i can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .    5.559854138941187
mr president , i was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general .    2.7470937714900976
it is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands , so to speak , but go straight to the electronic voting system .    2.951048487886405
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .    4.4217124929611575
i know it takes longer , but should we not always have a show of hands first ?    3.521898348419109
mr president , as far as the second reading is concerned , the commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by parliament .    3.818510443983193
the commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it .    2.9045694293347943

explanations of vote - own resources    3.4208865116305565
. ( fr ) the european union is apparently financed through four own resources .    3.0260138486278505
the european budget is effectively UNK from vat and on the basis of gdp , especially now that the community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy , which had already been cut back drastically by the generalised system of preferences .    3.4326469305284903
since then , community vat fraud and distortions in the calculation of gdp , the UNK basis for the fourth resource , have had a UNK effect on the yield and justice of community resources .    3.760409241881569
since then , of course , this europe with UNK to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .    3.384430812767239
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us .    3.4934295552786363
it shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the commission .    3.541909713988759
furthermore , the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the UNK member states .    4.1944048700732015
this is a long way from UNK such as the " community criminal code " , the " european public prosecutor " or a european police force , with olaf .    3.7823738874482693
there is as yet no federal european tax .    3.1991778457199955
all the same , a europe with 25 members will be wanting a european tax on income , if not on profits , or the tax on co2 to finance the budget for 2025 .    3.8360702159392903
koch report ( a5 - 0105 / 1999 )    2.8729469911661285
- ( fr ) it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods .    2.1249943902260315
in recent years , the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably , increasing the risk of accidents .    3.41656069451938
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation .    3.175550516716032
it therefore proved necessary , in the context of establishing the internal market , to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention .    3.894282276380703
directive 96 / 35 / ec was a response to this requirement .    3.2209010035943786
firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the UNK and UNK operations related to such transportation have been obliged , quite rightly , to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention , whether road , rail or inland waterway transport is involved .    3.685083035244224
in order to facilitate achieving this objective , directive 96 / 35 / ec provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training .    3.034792011641216
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .    3.396305687305136
while this represented significant progress at the time , the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem .    3.817804214231715
it therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised , high - level training of safety advisers , but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training , with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different member UNK .    4.002199623544838
the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised .    3.3148019860468994
it outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies .    3.2294217504839917
parliament voted in favour of this text .    3.8039883073506906
it did , however , table a number of amendments , most of which were adopted in the council ' s common position , particularly regarding the need to draw up a UNK and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the ' specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body ' .    4.627115340302368
in order to be realistic , i further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force .    3.3810676617217927
i shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users , to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods .    3.21091263852754
koch report ( a5 - 0104 / 1999 )    2.7089366643931663
last october i expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail .    3.3562224806506564
the views i shall express today are not far removed from those i had then .    3.1125600966153084
i shall point out that a directive on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 january 1997 .    3.0512684726774117
this included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 january 1999 .    3.720255789442449
this is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the commission proposal to put an end to the derogations .    4.489890786996176
in line with the usual procedure , it is the european committee for standardisation ( cen ) which puts forward standards in this area , and they are then integrated in to the european agreement concerning the international carriage of dangerous goods by road signed in geneva in 1957 ( known generally as adr ) , applicable throughout europe , whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the eu .    3.4161974276421736
the cen has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted .    4.187083661142851
this is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail , except for the fact that a time limit had been decided .    3.8689879536693903
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .    3.9341982113118386
until then , there is really no point in member states amending their national regulations .    4.53449208485666
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted , and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards .    3.010075186582228
they may , therefore , continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation , where there are no applicable european standards .    3.772487800975509
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .    2.910350686312846
in offering this explanation of my vote , therefore , i wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern .    3.717747516613562
schroedter report ( a5 - 0108 / 1999 )    3.2446950291296894
mr president , i wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the schroedter report with regard to regional development .    3.2376458554114436
i would urge both the member states and the commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in europe .    3.699299535714758
not only the difference in income per capita but , above all , large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern .    3.3372370859200857
despite the fact that the community , through the structural funds among others , UNK considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in europe , these disparities continue to exist .    4.188599837742029
i therefore wonder whether the community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , based on very strict evaluations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .    3.3248212242749156
mr president , in relation to the schroedter report , i am aware , and have had it confirmed to me by mr barnier , that the rules on additionality concerning structural funds apply only at the level of member states and do not apply in a UNK and transparent way inside member states in favour of self - governing regions such as wales or scotland .    4.397196510656778
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs .    3.529788360127855
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time .    3.4491629564511808
i want it to be clear that though i voted in favour of the report , i have this important reservation .    4.4490087062738635
- the schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of eu structural funds in europe for the period 2000 - 2006 .    3.505862401804515
i believe that this is particularly important as eu structural funds are always spent in a manner which UNK the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision - making process for the spending of such funds .    3.3082435010102293
as a member of the european parliament for the constituency of leinster , i have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom - up schemes supported by national eu funds .    3.9565782642736975
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities .    3.6304820239013122
i believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision - making process for the spending of european structural funds .    3.1318676911184906
for example , we have seen the success of the leader i and leader ii schemes in ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of ireland and within europe .    4.0945702574662075
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .    3.395727975240234
the leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public , private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long - term and sustainable jobs in small and medium - sized enterprises in rural areas .    3.2087345383894172
this is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit .    3.332435442729495
the european peace and reconciliation fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in ireland .    3.5383179182130076
once again , there is active participation from groups from the private , public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region .    3.198310751959405
during the next round of eu structural funds 2000 - 2006 , other eu initiatives such as " equal " and " urban " will be operating .    3.1886846835310356
these initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best european structural funds should be spent .    3.478633636382848
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new eu structural fund plans and programmes .    3.7236552946816546
they must promote a decentralised , efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities .    3.4946013222822803
this is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , european and local funding .    3.4648631164191888
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) this report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy .    3.7840719181905538
in order to reduce disparities between regions , of course .    3.7918713863975793
but more especially because , even though at first sight the european market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy , it may also be a source of inequality .    4.236678452500098
jacques delors was UNK to saying that the market was short - sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities .    3.9306236210757177
it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the european social model , which we are all in favour of , and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion .    4.085954688177525
this is a real political objective , alongside economic and monetary affairs , drawn up in collaboration with member states , regions and local communities , with the commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show member states what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming .    3.9335313279248645
this is why i shall support this report , despite regretting the fact that , for UNK reasons , the european parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist member states , regions and local communities in the programming of objectives 1 , 2 and 3 .    3.6811533695819527
moreover , i would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs , adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion , support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy .    3.825481901361685
mrs schroedter ' s report marks a further step towards the transparency and effectiveness of structural aid .    3.4858650362930446
it highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved , chiefly those involved at a local level , who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems , hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships , which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned .    3.9314616687022874
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the member states , which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid .    3.5239042636267106
in order to do so , the monitoring committees must be opened to include members of the european parliament , associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society .    3.6640232085995894
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid .    3.3266751756913058
amended again as such by the schroedter report , they are a step in the right direction .    3.2370869221847287
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after 2006 , but that is another subject .    4.254657470369544
- this report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid UNK out by some member states .    3.5704312142391657
although i wholeheartedly support this aim , i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether .    3.765008022776989
in my mind , illegal state aid amounts to little more than state - sponsored social dumping .    3.254295444176938
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by UNK UNK industry , we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments .    3.8293569779312695
if we are to have an effective single market that makes european industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all europeans , then we must have a level playing field .    3.3653056352597908
illegal state aid , by contrast , destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment .    3.6363006630509838
there are , of course , cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate , for example helping companies restructure .    3.6619900169200723
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained .    4.313323563420506
whether we are talking about beef to france or about UNK to industry , eu member states must not be allowed to flout the law .    3.9869759644139275
i enthusiastically support the report ' s proposal to publish a " scoreboard " showing the amount of state aid per member state .    3.3106171672275475
countries that claim to be at the heart of europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and UNK and their hypocrisy revealed .    3.8246953080173376
member states cannot be allowed to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private .    3.3819989664338332
i take some UNK encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in europe appear to be falling .    4.292123694825679
much remains to be done , however , and i call on the commission to be far tougher in UNK the subsidy UNK of europe .    4.432305546300172
.    2.4274255028413507
( pt ) the commission ' s main instruments for overcoming regional disparities are the structural funds and the cohesion fund . it is therefore crucial that the european parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity , given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective member states .    3.80549853852702
unfortunately , the european commission has already moved ahead with its guidelines and parliament ' s position on the programmes for 2000 - 2006 does not carry much weight .    3.7213199716414707
it is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions , of which the portuguese regions of the azores and madeira are examples . this must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion .    4.461108998290605
the truth is though , that the commission ' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives .    3.435695738419359
on the other hand , it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity , and supporting the social economy and solidarity . there must also be support for rural development , for small and medium - sized enterprises , for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas , specifically in the field of social housing , with a view to achieving sustainable urban development .    3.270621944534434
.    2.4274255028413507
( it ) while article 158 of the ec treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the communities , we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled , or rather in some cases , as with italy ' s objective 1 zones , paradoxically , disparities are being exacerbated , particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural UNK to community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures ; despite the changes to the rules , the community structures have not yet been streamlined .    4.142322117069119
in the first place , if administrative procedures are not simplified , it will be hard to attain community objectives on reform , with a view to greater efficiency and concentration .    3.442218021501171
in this respect , the commission document has shortcomings , as it makes no recommendation to the member states to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities , and for their funding , execution and monitoring .    4.173508890463342
smes , micro - enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still " weak operators " , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some member states , including italy , are major obstacles to accessing structural funds .    3.493525470423152
in view of this , in accordance with the decision on the 97 / 99 guidelines ( UNK report ) , the commission should have consulted parliament in time . in fact , it found a sort of convenient excuse in the UNK of the programming stage in the member states , and it published the guidelines back in july 1999 , even before the new parliament had taken up its legislative duties , thereby preventing parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines .    4.085509615478304
this is why the mid - term review , provided for under article 42 of regulation 1260 / 99 , will be of considerable importance .    2.9377231790879064
in general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .    3.3513214701398426
they merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely UNK with the strategies followed in community policies , and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement , so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities , or candidate countries .    4.161608296379528
that said , the differing approach adopted in the guidelines , which are not geared to geographical objectives , but rather to policy areas , can be considered as positive .    4.557852252000436
while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions , we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the objective 1 zones allows , in practice , a policy of integrated interventions , for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary .    4.228450491208728
we could then , theoretically , also support the commission ' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the member states , with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there , provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level , but guarantees real help for those zones - and i stress this once again - which , owing to a whole string of converging negative factors , have not yet harnessed structural funds to sufficient levels , with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could , in fact , amount to a negative intervention .    3.6392319496242784
the guidelines , as adopted by the commission , are very limited because , instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance , they are providing a shopping list of possible measures , a shopping list which , as it fails to set priorities in UNK order , could even put the member states on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration .    4.1234744989397845
we could say that , in this state of affairs , we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring - UNK ever - increasing urbanisation and , hence the destruction of the countryside .    4.056813582258178
there has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument , which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and , moreover , would accord proper status to local bodies which , being independent , could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly , and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the structural funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency , concentration and administrative reform .    4.054678753246929
rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .    4.24699355336059
it is now a fact that in order to attain this goal , rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs , which are no longer solely connected with agriculture , in the traditional sense - although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity - but also , for instance , in rural tourism , sport and cultural activities , environmental projects , smes , services , and so on .    4.26710624045341
a genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the UNK of coordination between the esf and employment strategy . the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme period implies that the member states really do need " guidelines " .    4.037695444141386
i must also stress that once again the commission is , in fact , UNK the issue of practical action on equal opportunities .    4.412042976987799
in conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .    3.7251837435069026
berend report ( a5 - 0107 / 1999 )    3.3083931243569316
. ( pt ) we basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union .    2.7311637377150357
firstly , and as the commission itself states , it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita gdp between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new german länder in calculating the community average from 1991 onwards .    3.910537419721029
this obviously caused a slight reduction in the union ' s per capita gdp level .    4.098687050589691
we also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment . this consequently imposes the need for new development strategies , with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area .    3.6461645483900424
this situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the member states , which is what the report proposes .    4.214345288946945
finally , but no less importantly , i would like to refer to the rapporteur ' s proposal that , in future , this type of report should also include , amongst other issues , an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each state .    4.314438189107063
the huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same state mean that there is a need for an in - depth assessment of this issue . this kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee UNK to regional ( and other ) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each member state .    3.570128471726845
. ( fr ) considering the employment situation in the community and the european union ' s declared ambition to UNK attack unemployment , the analysis of mergers carried out by the commission should take elements other than competition into consideration .    4.191560250261422
as an example i would give the restructuring of abb alsthom power . a sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout europe is visiting strasbourg today .    3.0277616671191367
the management of abb alsthom power , following a merger carried out in june 1999 , announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries .    4.119271924976788
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions , particularly regarding the information given to the european works council , in existence since 1996 .    3.9982694808420023
it suggests that the community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened .    3.4372743503975505
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment , the environment and consumers into consideration .    3.940497194418826
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect , i abstained .    3.3403481698179167
.    2.4274255028413507
( pt ) by proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in community competition policy , the commission is UNK to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion . issues of mergers and state aid however , still remain within the notification system .    4.004992262253807
the position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy , moving towards applying community law in national courts rather than at the european court of justice , and even aims at having specialised courts .    3.6130201240948927
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states .    3.285342372781911
on the other hand , as the rapporteur points out , in the name of competition policy , public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies , with the privatisation of important industries and public companies , as has happened in portugal , with harmful consequences for the country and its workers .    4.046783152535715
- ( fr ) the commission ' s white paper on the modernisation of the rules implementing articles 85 and 86 of the ec treaty ( now 81 and 82 ) certainly does not propose any " renationalisation " of competition policy , as some members of the european parliament fear .    2.9228497068265242
but it does , at least , make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the european union .    3.731219181381625
in fact , taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade , and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new member states , the commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements , and to apply competition rules at member state level in a more decentralised fashion .    3.5595030809850066
the most remarkable thing , in my view , is the message conveyed by this proposal : that the commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and UNK that this necessarily , and virtually automatically , requires reform of the centralised system .    4.324364576104362
admittedly , this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling .    3.809801618304094
indeed , the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .    4.086193882325065
moreover , the von wogau report , which the european parliament has just voted on , supports it in so doing .    3.9026127264912316
but at the same time , one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended .    3.276896994440395
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term .    3.3860625504546307
is this not , indeed , what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament ?    3.9677335566367153
curiously , a number of employers agreed with them , preferring the european " one - stop " system , which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally .    4.079194345395187
indeed , this is one advantage of the present system .    4.366795483450005
but , on the other hand , the wider view must also be taken , namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may , in the long term , lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account , and this will be of benefit to everyone .    4.333482204535087
rapkay report ( a5 - 0078 / 1999 )    3.40357915234184
the members of parliament from the UNK UNK party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on european competition policy .    4.236230714812956
competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other , which constantly takes the form of layoffs , factory closures , not to mention extensive waste of production capacity .    3.3497236134241035
we see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power .    3.598281013450549
eighteen million unemployed and 50 million poor people within the european union , despite its being one of the UNK regions in the world : these are the results of this competition which the european institutions intend to promote .    5.017397435312728
the commission ' s declared intention to regulate the conditions of competition on the european market is ridiculous , for the only law which competition respects is the law of the jungle where the most powerful UNK or devour the weakest elements .    3.6880886538220183
this is UNK most of all in social terms .    3.821043750655945
the european commission ' s report is a blunt demonstration of the fact that the union institutions have no interest in anything except the major capitalist corporations who are engaged in this economic warfare and have no interest in the victims this causes .    3.4173691267910127
there is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment , nothing to protect employees , nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still !    3.7930813356864186
we acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the european institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions , and still less of improving them .    4.143207456777623
- ( fr ) in voting against this report , we are acting as UNK for all the men and women who in seattle and throughout europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic .    3.5636766887924183
we are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services , in memory of the victims of the paddington rail disaster , killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations .    3.68686715684303
this report is essentially a UNK text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle , for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century .    3.532834282792298
whether it is a matter of the balance of the UNK , culture or cooperation with the third world , excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity .    4.490950235856469
do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy ?    3.3336585232693854
we are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .    4.136532530742526
excessive in comparison with what iron rule , what criteria of efficiency ?    3.6056050068632852
finally , after seattle , do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto ?    3.766403529051016
only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such UNK .    3.0014906866441504
jonckheer report ( a5 - 0087 / 1999 )    3.401785162573269
i am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the eu , and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report , and also that the directorate - general for competition will be making information , both general and specific , publicly accessible via its website .    4.138660555041236
i am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this .    4.083564742346113
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid UNK as a measure causing distortion in competition .    3.2461831859974892
admittedly , an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union .    3.331933756931078
however , as the rapporteur pointed out , such aid is occasionally essential and may , in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm , make it possible to contribute to sustainable development ( article 6 of the treaty ) , services of general economic interest ( article 16 ) and economic and social cohesion ( article 158 ) .    3.7816836575479114
clearly though , it must be monitored , a task which falls to the european commission .    4.3403853271232515
the aid which union member states allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of eur 95 billion in the period 1995 - 1997 , including 40 % allocated to the manufacturing sector .    3.2175173556171615
this aid is considerably less than the previous period , 1993 - 1995 ( a 13 % drop in the total amount and a drop from 3 . 8 % to 2 . 6 % in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector ) .    3.5091796382314246
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german länder .    3.965494707112145
like the rapporteur , i deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid .    3.5355207665407957
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .    2.715516330174159
it must also cooperate with the member states in order to improve the quality of data in good time , which is to say in time for the UNK report .    4.858329045188847
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state .    2.830129043781514
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid .    3.395037498490468
in order to compensate for this situation , the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us .    3.7312271454165704
i shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which i feel is particularly dangerous : the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one member state to another , with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the eu .    4.089268117427523
this is why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment , industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries .    3.5179380844915182
langen report ( a5 - 0073 / 1999 )    3.418600934538992
in the important debate on competition this morning , i expressed my views on mr langen ' s report on the implementation in 1998 of the sixth steel aid code .    2.882360968272991
just as the court of justice recognised in its order of 3 may 1996 , the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation .    2.9003278119615494
establishing a system of aids to this sector intended to ensure the survival of successful firms was therefore justifiable , even though article 4 ( c ) , of the ecsc treaty prohibited any sort of state aid to the steel industry .    3.999188207212861
this , indeed , is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code .    3.434102249820974
at the same time , it is , of course , essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets , hence the importance of regulating such aid .    3.0059584827613155
it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development , environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure .    3.3204446858605365
in the same way , it is vital for member states to fulfil their obligation to report to the commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings , as stipulated under article 7 of the steel aid code .    3.6861859382695137
the commission suggests that member states submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six - month period or , at least , annually , without the need for UNK .    4.007054574111716
like the rapporteur , i am pleased with the commission report , but i did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid .    4.468027985237346
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .    3.2382350271493467
in the interests of equality , there are grounds to either apply the steel aid code strictly or UNK the code if the commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment .    3.6722981736054683
finally , we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty .    3.016033387830543
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002 .    3.0531086056504955
my feeling in this respect is that only a council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code .    3.5756905037515643
for all these reasons i voted in favour of the langen report , and i now await the commission ' s response to our requests and demands .    3.5126821076195163
( the sitting was suspended at 1 . 05 p . m . and resumed at 3 p . m . )    1.8444907421857875
oil slick off the french coast    3.9107463102310063
the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast .    2.384397746119447
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission .    3.9626893463659068
mr president , i shall be speaking on behalf of the ppe - de group , but also as an elected representative for brittany , and i am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events .    3.4298036867631216
together with mrs grossetête and the ppe - de group , we tabled a motion for a resolution .    2.527591157758272
i am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion .    3.685972762816615
the erika shipwreck is a truly european issue , firstly because it is UNK and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in europe , with extremely serious consequences for tourism , people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists , and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a european scale .    3.767205022418966
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline , and why ?    3.408046900738831
because the americans managed to learn their lesson from the exxon valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the oil pollution act , which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities , as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable , and is more restrictive , and , more especially , more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and , in particular , the existence of the american coastguard .    3.8216581061042527
if , i repeat , we had had regulations of this type , then this disaster would surely not have occurred .    4.050583571762715
well , if the charterer is UNK , then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for .    3.923195785310638
the regulations must therefore be reviewed , and i thank you , commissioner , for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations .    4.12902519864021
moreover , as you said , monitoring must above all be stepped up : that of the flag state , that of the classification societies .    3.9041691989986904
what are the conditions for this recognition ?    3.476615139422287
what guarantees are there of its reliability ?    3.1491988905328436
you are going to commission a fact - finding mission .    3.1433685911817593
we await the outcome with great interest .    3.054411438964981
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be UNK up .    3.7525108175523143
there is a paris memorandum in existence , let me remind you , which stipulates a minimum for inspection , that is , one in four of the vessels putting into european ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned .    3.628462067268742
this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other european countries .    3.5448302417168893
why not ?    2.953813619373112
what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw ?    3.5475408848512
i also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for , in this case , the oil company .    3.9917334155646707
if the charterer ' s liability entails a financial commitment , then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent .    3.1529048263311634
finally , we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of european facility comparable to the UNK who supervise the coasts of the united states .    3.8704049326441803
firstly , i would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team .    3.00282630647684
this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .    3.685339314992477
here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster .    3.728733473794759
i could UNK off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this parliament but i only have three minutes .    3.672375651045497
surely it is now about time that not only the member states but that UNK tiger that is known as the international maritime organisation , and last but not least , the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year .    3.6863990057938234
how many more UNK do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the european union , not just certain areas of it ?    3.6845928786038074
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with UNK tanks and double holds ?    3.2643173174443034
how many more UNK are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which , as our resolution points out , causes far more pollution than any erika - type disaster ?    3.1665045680027863
while i recognise that some progress has been made in areas like port state control and minimal UNK standards , we are still faced with what our late colleague UNK UNK used to call ' ships of shame sailing in and out of our european union waters : rust UNK badly UNK ' .    3.3636186186802166
we need the member states to act quickly and decisively .    3.363377663619568
we need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety .    3.761981772581045
the erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods . just as the sea UNK , just as the UNK did .    3.605151603325077
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster .    2.901938975675335
my group ' s sympathy goes out to the people of brittany who have seen their area UNK by this disaster , just as my group ' s sympathy went out to the people of west wales and to the shetland islands on previous occasions .    3.5227632200166656
is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement UNK to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again , later on this year , discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag - of - convenience tanker sadly goes down UNK its crude oil all over the sea .    3.3218767215875205
the time for resolutions has passed .    3.1562827354581553
what is now needed is action .    3.228798458521182
sadly , i fear , the council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster .    4.544833202135031
mr president , every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again .    3.755463022053463
in reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea , but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future .    3.501773867045596
the " erika " incident was serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affected , but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of europe .    3.516643982854279
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as 400 , 000 birds , perhaps mainly UNK , may have died .    3.5944609469204503
the pictures many of us will have seen of oil - UNK birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .    3.3528182609368185
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying .    3.4467578493302478
we need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the " polluter pays " principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced .    3.506888118881748
i agree with every word the commissioner said in her remarks , but the question is , how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes ?    4.432353346437408
as a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this parliament in a year , were a similar incident , just as devastating , to take place , if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice .    4.057320116307859
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully .    3.4255706551475043
mr president , commissioner , i have brought you a small gift . here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the french island of UNK who wrote to me as follows : " with every tide , the UNK is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the erika .    3.324538249387007
with every tide , the volunteers , members of the armed forces and UNK remove great UNK of this UNK , UNK , black tar .    4.234000781260779
when will we see a return to UNK and the end of this devastating accident ? "    4.193826214747958
indeed this disaster involving the erika , like that of the russian vessel in turkey , moreover , is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi - tech technology is available .    3.6126182538416995
it is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the amoco cadiz disaster , despite our saying at the time and many times since , " never again ! "    3.368498970825665
it is , of course , the responsibility of policies , and therefore our responsibility , to guarantee the safety of sea transport .    3.8795206486445895
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again .    3.5982819073528693
indeed , we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many .    3.766827889478611
this is why it is essential , as a matter of urgency , for the european union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes .    3.4062992250253683
we should be aware , for example , that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to transport their oil .    3.703896746523101
why , in these circumstances , is the liability of total as charterer not recognised ?    4.165118551378951
your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance , at last , of the ban on degassing at sea .    3.472419794146857
a european inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently .    3.0741733164004823
in addition , it is also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo , as a matter of urgency .    3.849234367731941
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if , once they are at sea , most vessels do just what they wish ?    3.562841548738452
finally , a UNK thought for all the volunteers , nature lovers and bird lovers , who UNK and UNK are coming through to the aid of the oil - covered birds , organising rescue operation with the means available .    3.793462656003099
i can testify to this remarkable work .    2.8468299288052514
you are no doubt aware that approximately 200 000 birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick , which is a major ecological disaster , practically unprecedented in scale .    3.7509782999289425
in relation to this , you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces .    3.6357066248147785
once again , there will be no clearly defined party responsible .    3.137202070467707
in the meantime , it is nature that is taking the UNK , as always .    4.624188418171437
mr president , my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster , affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment .    4.132978929844822
let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitors ' gallery of mrs UNK - le UNK , spokesperson for the oil slick action group " UNK UNK " , made up of men and women from the french department of UNK .    3.6572609363476234
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field .    4.0239056287895645
as the european parliament , we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and , at the same time , demanding tightening up of the quality criteria , on the european and international scale , of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport , stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders .    4.17624826893723
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers .    3.809836073030337
among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .    3.71944102049647
this is no longer tolerable .    2.5667585120142995
next , we have flags of convenience .    3.685821320996895
according to the international transport federation , over 40 % of the ships UNK in 1998 were sailing under flags of convenience , the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety .    3.40680919619529
this is no longer tolerable .    2.5667585120142995
finally , there is the lack of transparency .    3.7509368975475814
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility , the identity of the owners and real decision - makers as UNK as possible .    3.7037260838457735
this is no longer tolerable .    2.5667585120142995
in all these respects we must ensure real , significant change , including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards , including the mandatory double hull , on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of member states .    3.3381158514866662
we must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea - worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels .    2.7233629176676706
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused .    3.8320029016769195
i am thinking specifically of total - fina in the present instance .    3.317516627831632
this is an approach , mr president , which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation .    4.921008758901424
in so doing , it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which , in this instance , is awaiting clear , tangible action .    3.8255745836023394
mr president , commissioner , as a member for the french atlantic coast , for vendée , i should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the erika oil slick in the face of these disasters , caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us , but by a crime .    3.7070336360923637
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .    3.7129844483609533
what the stricken populations are waiting for now , those who have lost everything , particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism , those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come , is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused , but for the UNK to now be set in motion to ensure that their present UNK serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future .    3.69401701981737
quite clearly , we are now paying the price for our lack of concern .    3.7890459507432745
because our states , with the blessing of the community , did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know - how to disappear , we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships UNK our waters under flags of convenience , UNK according to the short - term interests of the multinationals .    3.8867144760342205
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this UNK of irresponsibility , irresponsible charterers , UNK shipowners and lenient certification companies .    2.6246727972261445
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion .    3.5556319596225676
obviously , such matters should be handled at world level , but the current international regulations of the imo are far from adequate and are far too loose , and neither our own countries nor the community have tried UNK to make them stricter , despite previous disasters .    3.5651845533256434
admittedly , there is the international oil pollution compensation fund , UNK , but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level , which must be reviewed .    4.3404426887463865
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo .    3.2836546595487643
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this .    4.260124608321288
let me remind you that the erika was sailing under a flag of convenience , that of a state applying for membership of the european union .    2.852253060351799
in addition , there are community directives , but they are seldom applied , if at all , due to the insufficient number of national inspectors .    3.6600347711700345
this omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency .    3.1775161533326584
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years , but it is making very slow progress .    4.249181337851838
the date when the commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again . it is now scheduled for july .    4.354904011665771
this must be brought forward .    3.8177152520965474
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict .    3.912340613410633
i shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities .    3.2091283063921576
firstly , the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally .    3.567075596211718
the best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil , criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select .    3.7376576228823555
secondly , the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely .    3.0867445557993634
thirdly , a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future .    3.2738908089216054
this could be of a maximum of 15 years of age .    3.31292970059527
if we do not obtain a framework of community regulations which is sufficiently clear , strict and trenchant , then those member states that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory , in the same way that the united states succeeded in learning the lessons of the exxon valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters .    3.6004147577572128
if the european community had done the same , a great disaster would have been avoided .    4.16894906010313
let us ensure , mr president , commissioner , that this time we really do learn the lesson , even after the media UNK and the shock of this house have died down .    4.075674749718406
mr president , torrey canyon , UNK UNK , UNK , amoco cadiz , UNK , UNK , so many names we remember with horror .    3.7766697657589674
and now the erika .    3.7748919103792606
whose turn is next ?    3.4419664694486425
twenty one years after amoco cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .    2.979577979314301
the atlantic west coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react , for their capitulation to the multinationals .    2.929864327550356
it is hard to understand why the french and the europeans allow something which the americans refuse to accept , and why europe , normally so quick to pass environmental legislation , has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety .    3.4294582514884144
and this is the result .    4.4139313585862805
the erika , a vessel flying a maltese flag , a UNK rust UNK , classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers , has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the amoco cadiz .    3.123204894147923
as an elected representative for the loire - atlantique region , unfortunately , i can testify to this .    3.4936081131652434
there is nothing natural about these recurring disasters , they are the result of fate .    3.52216685522303
they are the result of human UNK .    3.5836351429090154
what we have here is an ecological disaster .    3.229396764967685
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that .    3.0175022292541387
it is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism , fishermen , oyster farmers , shellfish farmers , people who make a living from the UNK UNK , shopkeepers , etc .    3.1849828543947414
the erika disaster must be the last in the series .    3.7766664457014545
first of all , we must shed some light on this shipwreck .    3.2090617496417257
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get members of parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the commission ?    3.7029734892309425
next , as a matter of urgency , we UNK pass legislation , firstly , regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported .    3.3243710982838426
in fact , according to the experts , the oil the erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast .    3.305805205490295
we know what actually happened .    2.941497595708036
next , reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in france for vehicles more than five years old .    3.1433200551994287
we must regulate the use of flags of convenience , make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials , work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover UNK at sea .    3.357988121487638
this would be a minimum requirement , i believe , on the dawn of the third millennium .    4.455146004073374
non - UNK vessels must be denied access to european waters , the responsibility of polluters , shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the " polluter pays " , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing , thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required , an appropriate " natural disasters " budget line must be re - established for member states and , in the meantime , community aid released on an exceptional basis and the french departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for structural funds .    3.5269542979560953
i have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group .    4.173406108718907
mr president , in the course of the last few years there has been a UNK of serious tanker disasters world - wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning .    3.140156839534896
it is particularly bad this time , not least because it has affected a major european state ; an incident which could happen again at any time .    3.537623996540433
we urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks . the 15 clearly do not suffice .    3.4788602768813504
these guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things .    3.412570828908287
no tanker or UNK fit only for the scrap UNK must ever put into any harbour within the european union again . all those involved , including the transport UNK , are responsible for any ensuing damage , and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances .    3.8489479991687316
however , we must aim higher in the long - term , let there be no mistake about that .    3.114542565876971
in other words , we need real cost - effectiveness for our entire energy supply system .    3.1483517577981246
mr president , may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .    3.2698562449499406
many thanks for this .    3.6576341955885963
this also means that , in any case , i have a great deal of respect for the UNK note which she sent on 10 january but also for the action points which she announced today .    3.86643452228672
the erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and european level , nature and the environment come off second - best .    3.306136651505698
the damage suffered , also in ecological terms , cannot be expressed in money .    3.3685900080521973
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management members .    3.4305854840825747
during the christmas break , when the dutch media received attention for the erika disaster , i had a look , just out of interest , on the internet to see what arrangements were , in fact , already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures , especially after UNK jospin had said that europe should do more .    4.176939714439419
what i learned is that , actually , there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision .    4.687984507382398
could i highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the commissioner ?    4.004859542469234
first of all , the port - state control , according to which 25 % of all ships require inspection .    3.264916067378496
i think that this 25 % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place . so this 25 % should be increased .    3.4617739546224153
but this is not in place .    3.809386512533378
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .    2.873157529093054
finally , as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned , some members have already mentioned just now that , since 1999 in the united states , ships should in any case be double - hulled .    4.189439748775105
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and i also think that the marpol treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .    4.146818468894487
mr president , i would like to take a brief , critical look at the accession negotiations with malta and would like to express my gratitude to , and admiration for , the many ngos that have at least rolled up their UNK in order to save animals .    3.6488626384917846
mr president , we have already had this discussion so many times in the past .    2.991750184255903
we have achieved nothing so far , and we have been unable to reach agreement within the european union .    4.11455440873093
that is why i will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today , and what the commissioner has announced here , actually leads to legislation being produced ; in other words , if you all go and say to your heads of government and ministers : " you must push this through in the council of ministers " .    3.9720978309725834
so what are we to do now ?    2.860973513079966
i have no intention of talking about past events ; rather i want to look to the future .    3.3341250002676546
what are we to do now ?    2.428160720465459
i will tell you a few things we should do .    3.8341821335627455
of course , we need double - hulled vessels .    3.2208329856139155
that goes without saying , but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term .    4.28355462853793
so what do we need to happen immediately ?    4.476302567174407
we need technical testing of ships , that is obligatory technical testing every two years , and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate .    3.6926377880590833
we need this at european level and internationally ; we need something like a tüv , an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in germany , which is compulsory every two years .    3.5213770560479327
if you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle .    3.6060886192598534
this is what we need for ships .    3.1186094377404054
thirdly , we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports , that is in every port of the european union .    3.975019576616427
any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port , regardless of all the port charges .    3.5620187329371213
we must reach agreement here , in all the european union ' s ports , from UNK , through to rotterdam , to UNK , cuxhaven , and wherever ships drop anchor .    4.104049007597615
fourthly , we need the UNK to bear liability , and not just to the tune of a derisory usd 12 million , but to the value of at least usd 400 million , to be covered per insurance certificate .    4.419531890350326
we also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability .    2.740143584928981
we need to be sure that if need be , the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability .    2.9153682315730856
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision !    3.229535236132749
i can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability .    2.7668724634631205
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the european union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries .    4.059252036016678
last but not least , we need a long memory , for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future .    4.455801203117522
environmental standards will be a recurring theme .    4.336246843848345
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports .    3.5342602637901726
the unions will have something to say as will industry .    3.4599147888900137
a long memory will serve us well , ladies and gentlemen .    3.5294203951244763
i am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement .    3.216159079516936
just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .    3.682305931889233
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports .    3.1890450594600095
we need to have a long memory when we say : " for once we are united , at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned , and will not play one off against the other in the european union . "    4.049269513368226
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years ' time !    3.9166878994685366
mr president , mrs roth - behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts .    3.1003912557294893
we have now obtained a first - rate UNK of a variety of measures .    3.7482071711857294
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led ?    4.029086079471366
i would compare the situation with an earlier generation ' s introduction of the UNK line , a marking which was introduced to prevent insurance fraud involving inferior vessels .    3.465872372608409
i consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that mrs roth - behrendt speaks about , the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in europe have brought up for discussion .    3.3522175587569873
we must also critically examine the classification societies .    2.7024810884916075
i do not think that we can accept their procedures .    3.3967419718067338
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .    3.034055912397408
finally , i want to say that , when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment , there are units within the commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards .    3.613790981576664
within the commission , the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing .    5.573617806188137
it is not an acceptable procedure that measures to improve the environment , which are in keeping with the commission ' s guidelines , cannot be taken because these are considered to constitute prohibited aid to shipyards .    3.8316781070159203
mr president , we shall vote in favour of the gue / ngl group resolution because it UNK total - fina ' s responsibility in this ecological disaster and i endorse the proposal that flags of convenience and the use of UNK vessels should be prohibited , or that double hulls should be mandatory for oil tankers .    3.295325530195294
i shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick .    3.624402934899471
how can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations , and indeed many others who , in order to make more profit , take the risk of making the world UNK ?    3.7929223837076567
how is it possible not to be outraged when a bank refuses to UNK the names of the erika ' s owners on the grounds of professional confidentiality , without governments reacting ?    3.404956363371388
the crux of the problem is that all governments , and indeed all the european institutions , acknowledge the right of major corporations such as total - fina and its UNK to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment .    3.956784248605863
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks , even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions .    3.2375471308007273
in these circumstances , even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations ' capacity to cause damage .    3.245683911972824
mr president , i am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies .    2.684072088600123
however , we must stick to the facts .    3.2092147138515656
the ship erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years .    3.2321470522139872
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken .    3.636881124093184
i have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the member states do not have enough money to undertake the controls .    4.076765889731234
i cannot accept this .    3.065768219110208
if the member states decide , in agreement with ourselves , that 25 % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control , then they must also make the necessary personnel available .    4.346697982303437
the controls must also be carried out in such a way that the UNK does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire UNK missing , rather there must be materials testing , for this ship obviously broke up on account of material UNK .    4.058625217025619
this can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous .    3.0660019549601567
it should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial , but include materials testing .    3.656355821455046
secondly , i also share the commissioner ' s observations and would like to encourage her to continue down this path .    3.729513980870375
if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies .    3.4492955144690587
that is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit .    3.013159826806318
mrs roth - behrendt , we already have a tüv ( organisation for safety testing ) for ships in the form of the classification companies .    2.9986821022002874
there are reputable companies too .    3.010056478884148
you will be familiar with some reputable companies , our french fellow meps will be familiar with some reputable companies , but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements , and these must be struck off the list .    2.9000577541018457
finally , we should make it quite plain to malta that if it wants to become a member of this community then by the time it UNK it must apply a standard in respect of UNK and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements , for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up !    4.364072411476843
mr president , commissioner , the erika sank near my home and is still there , with 20 000 tonnes in its hold , the fate of which we are waiting to discover .    3.3087020595145122
it could have sunk anywhere .    3.1658443119847823
my first thoughts are for the 26 indian UNK , who were saved but of whom nothing has been said .    3.648542436787228
there could have been deaths in this disaster and safety at sea means , above all , men ' s lives .    3.954770007318842
by now they are far away .    3.292779673627667
it is a miracle that they were saved .    3.562868260820606
so we are now experiencing the same thing that happened 20 years ago with the amoco cadiz ; a wreck on the north coast , a wreck on the south coast , a wreck on the west coast .    3.154388139843759
things could well continue in the same way .    3.3944073529231726
commissioner , as time is very short , i would like to pick out the seven points which we feel , and you have already mentioned some of them , are essential to work on : double - hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports . in particular , we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public , as currently , we do not have access to them .    4.046207312257644
we must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience , not because they are necessarily bad boats , but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones .    3.3896763562923398
we must improve information on all of the world ' s ships , but provision has already been made for this . we must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them .    4.29404804223693
with regard to this matter , i would like to know who owns the erika , because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing , but there are always real shareholders in the background . where are the erika ' s owners ?    3.729511045687164
perhaps they are in lovely UNK by lovely beaches , getting a nice UNK .    3.163718399597321
we would like to know their names and their faces .    3.1828831343310013
finally , there must be improvements in the training of UNK .    3.5583135100560073
mr president , i welcome the statement from the commissioner .    2.7020268383291746
having spent a lot of time at sea myself i am well aware of the sea ' s power and destructive force , which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential .    3.5689488642919165
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika .    3.000101754035491
it should be noted that the oil industry , through the international oil pollution compensation funds , regards itself as liable under the 1969 convention and its 1992 protocol , for over 90 % of the estimated cost of this incident , or some usd UNK million .    3.0469944787310324
this suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners , to the flag state and the inspection authorities to UNK their share of the responsibility .    4.377368058495625
in that context i support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection .    2.923807438952381
i support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels ' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions .    3.318134910133091
calls for design improvements in hull construction , especially double - hulled vessels , are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet .    3.304253571213901
mr president , i would like to thank my socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .    3.3831863691034396
because , as well as the irreparable damage to the environment , the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry , the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry , to the conservation of marine resources , and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover .    3.92571899343636
it is no accident , commissioner , that the affected areas are always those european regions which are least developed , those which UNK out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which , in the majority of cases , do not have any other resources .    4.121813043306719
i come from a region , galicia , which has suffered similar accidents in the past .    3.4017722230708087
brittany and galicia , two european ' lands ends ' , fall constant prey to the irresponsibility of those who prefer not to comply with safety regulations and transport crude oil in vessels which in themselves constitute potential oil slicks .    3.088092506727224
i therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways .    3.3847860349980627
on the one hand , by asking the commission , within the scope of aid to the fishing industry , to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected , and also by asking them to demand , of international bodies and of themselves , tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience .    3.769171550486993
in this regard , the current process of negotiations on malta ' s accession to the european union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously UNK the oil tankers which sail under its flag .    3.545899668232079
on the other hand , prevention is essential .    2.7111368061198537
portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea .    3.7979632241312817
i would ask the portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at european level , using all the means at our disposal - technological , structural and socio - economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future .    3.6256325417697766
lastly , mr president , i would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities , who reminded me of old times when , as the then UNK , i lived through similar situations .    3.4270312468199795
we must thank those who , while defenceless and lacking in resources , have UNK UNK against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions , the marine ecosystem and european fishing stocks .    3.5541567712111584
mr president , as chairman of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i should like to congratulate the commission , and in particular commissioner UNK de palacio , for her reaction to this incident , which has really shaken the whole of europe .    3.2702157837387884
we , as the committee on transport , are prepared to discuss the commission communication on the question of safety at sea and , of course , we are likewise prepared to discuss , at a later date , the legal implications of this communication .    4.67962316434261
first , the commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of rina , the italian shipping register , because we need to know if community law was applied .    4.058106038751687
that should be the starting point for our efforts .    3.430109196092732
secondly , apart from the shipowners ' liability , it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers , for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and , of course , for restoring the damage .    3.825506528130484
once we have done that , our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified .    3.607195976303766
however , this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine , which is an important sector of the economy , covering as it does 1 / 3 of transport requirements , which is why our reaction needs to be measured : strict , but correct .    4.011360283937486
i have no objection to examining an amendment making community law stricter but , as other members have stressed , we need to start with application , because there is already a legal framework at european union level and we must not lose sight of that fact .    4.022188332111277
this legal framework is fairly advanced , at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the member states , under the supervision of the commission , should endeavour to ensure that community law is actually applied .    4.319791595292978
mr president , commissioner , i believe that the unfortunate incident involving the erika should in fact , as others have said this afternoon , constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the european union where , since 1967 , there have been UNK accidents involving large oil tankers ; more than one every two years .    3.6769697850590544
the economic and social damage , which we have spoken about today , in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources , is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the community institutions .    3.9818924529554445
commissioner , i would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented .    3.546726521156341
i trust that these measures will , in a few months , give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive , possibly - which will put an end , once and for all , to these 21st century pirates , who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea .    3.7209951084479114
i would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken , which was mentioned by the commissioner and some of my colleagues .    4.790816284853875
i am referring to the double hull , which consists of two layers of steel , with containers divided into two tanks .    2.6873785879780754
commissioner , there are many experts who consider that the double hull is not sufficiently safe and propose the so - called ' ecological hull ' in which case , in the event of an accident , the UNK UNK the containers and , as a result of pressure , the oil is transferred to other tanks .    4.043278752463779
commissioner , i believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures .    3.296499124257336
it is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries .    3.161104984204665
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard .    3.506013636201625
any cost - benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm UNK to persons and the environment by these accidents , is bound to support this approach .    3.670391029595942
mr president , commissioner , i think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us , after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings , finally to produce a joint resolution .    3.647491571237281
i think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill - advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .    3.6860519720135194
on the other hand , parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote , for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me . i think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or UNK of a few governments and i think that we are providing the commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a european maritime area .    4.324093925809833
i think that it is quite obvious , and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the erika disaster , that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport .    3.2491895829930306
public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area , common UNK , a common rail area and a single market , but not a common maritime area . i therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms .    4.039882990722077
the commissioner has suggested three main UNK which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation , in which we can set standards .    4.235666711753565
i have also noted , to my great satisfaction , that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty , or the UNK groups are calling for europe to regulate , and i think that this is in fact the right level to take action .    4.247633877114166
in this area we must respond to public opinion .    3.3221122426436103
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are , when all is said and done , on the global scale merely a peninsula .    3.5651578622551923
therefore , once our legislation has been brought into line , we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law . we must also put in place systematic controls and finally apply the ' polluter pays ' principle of responsibility which is , of course , supposed to be a deterrent .    3.9970232505346743
i have almost finished and i would like to say that i have personally requested a public hearing of the committee on transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow - up to the erika case and to suggest possible future considerations .    3.965663000940574
i hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing .    3.3211190890717828
mr president , the oil tanker erika , the ownership of which is UNK by UNK addresses on malta and probably in italy and greece and which was UNK by total - fina for the transport of oil , UNK off the breton coastline , with disastrous consequences .    3.5045064917612376
the implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment are enormous .    4.675946642988322
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker .    3.658292624004341
so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods .    3.1924613167840694
the international maritime organisation has issued international rules in this connection .    3.271523911026536
states can carry out port inspections .    3.7080655232588353
in europe , legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect 25 % of the incoming vessels according to the port - state control directive .    4.040625214530392
however , it seems that none of the member states meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors .    3.60625937499886
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation .    3.0801879623373773
in my opinion , the commissioner is quite right .    3.3687699834892437
where the scheme UNK is in the enforcement of existing legislation .    3.586206551213105
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , esteemed european commission ?    3.5456516011118
can the commission provide an assurance that directive 93 / 75 concerning minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods will be implemented correctly in all member states ?    2.9377797199561346
should its implementation not be more strictly monitored ?    3.590585568524111
would it not be beneficial , in the short term , following the rotterdam model , to inspect according to a points system in which , for example , account is taken of the ship ' s age , whether it is single or double - hulled or whether it UNK under a flag of convenience .    3.6911721341882795
in short , to give priority to older sub - standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements .    2.8781586695780077
the erika was built at a japanese UNK and is single - hulled .    3.250068680680006
there are four more UNK ships in service at present .    3.2305853923630488
construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of UNK was especially high .    4.443578188826698
some of them also sail under the maltese flag .    2.9241406746105305
are we waiting for the next accident to happen ?    4.059048317039686
would sanctions not be appropriate , as the commissioner stated , for the classification society ?    4.880224612950515
rina is currently the talk of the town .    3.9092951925791657
i would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time , and this delay is going to limit the time available for questions to the commission .    3.5661576252865443
mr president , just before i went down into the chamber , i received an e - mail with a quite emotional description from a swedish woman who had chosen to spend new year ' s eve on the french coast in brittany instead of staying at home and celebrating with her relatives .    2.979030553590489
like many other hundreds of volunteers , she had seen the destruction , washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and UNK when they really should have been required to be there .    3.3611726993531117
like so many others , i too wonder where the people responsible are .    3.941156132252835
where are the shipowners and those who order the UNK when these disasters occur ?    3.6528045865248955
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime .    3.592175640817806
this is not the first time we have seen oil slicks , whether UNK or UNK .    3.038280921086941
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
i would like to thank mrs grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before parliament .    2.738668227438233
the environmental disaster of the sinking of the erika off brittany and the spillage of 10 000 tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the british media .    3.1518288828886476
although britain and france have had their differences recently , i can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected .    4.057602973811846
i salute these joint efforts to repair the damage .    2.8841436455791474
this is clearly a problem for all eu coastlines which will require imaginative solutions .    3.3846190748469276
instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as UNK of london , we must develop new technologies to UNK from the sea much more than 10 % of the lost oil .    4.137413503913195
there is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market UNK up the UNK .    3.2457627782125686
ultimately , the polluter must pay .    3.607187359351809
in addition we must build on the council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of 25 % of ships calling at eu ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered .    3.148526120149309
moreover , although i am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice , i believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations .    3.618203769705432
rather than banning flags of convenience , which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet , under the 1995 eu directive on port state control , national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations .    3.5519152109902317
i sincerely hope that , particularly during the french presidency later this year , the commission and the council will look carefully at all these options , and i heartily commend this resolution to parliament .    4.116879350992527
mr president , it feels quite strange to be standing here again today , as i have been doing at regular UNK for almost ten years , and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence , and not by force UNK .    3.9152241389104185
the victims are waiting outside .    3.5591350389666827
they want answers .    3.2402128240381662
they do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep , or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through .    3.8064574738069097
the citizens are right to ask : " do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever ? "    3.69162509501534
who will provide us with new jobs ?    3.546166656489703
when will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun ; nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group , rather it is a joint european challenge .    4.004258643120435
that is why i welcome mrs palacio ' s action plan with open arms .    3.2241525104350592
it is equally important to note that " prevention is better than cure " .    2.7474607370744555
but there is an art to that as well .    3.257265487077681
UNK the german UNK ship " UNK " - it is right outside my front door in cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of european neighbourly help .    3.062303862779862
we are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew .    3.7471929612031136
valuable experiences were gained , and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state - of - the - art technology alone .    3.956079326121722
we are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .    2.8404113125721975
i have been fighting for a european environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in parliament .    3.3575107553712584
the issue is as topical as it was before .    3.588404143950774
furthermore , i will not withhold my support but will endeavour , alongside my fellow meps , to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of european and international cooperation .    3.6287704662872193
mr president , firstly i would like to express my very sincere thanks , not only for the initiatives of the different groups , of mrs grossetête and the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and the european democrats , but also for the initiatives of mr wurtz and the confederal group of the united left / nordic green left , who proposed this debate , which has led to a positive and important discussion .    3.330667031496744
before the end of march , i propose to present a communication in which i will possibly present legislative texts , that is to say , amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the council and in parliament .    3.8955490789544376
i would like to tell you that , in fact , it is not just an environmental problem - it is a very important environmental problem - but it is also a very important social problem .    3.730382742253561
there are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas . they are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium .    3.4010401323297357
mrs roth - behrendt said that nothing had ever been done .    2.789365145898721
in fact , i believe that things have been done by the commission , but there is still more to do .    4.440659487794845
this was demonstrated by the americans who , after the exxon valdez disaster , within one year , adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation , which threatens , as i said earlier , to divert ships unacceptable to american ports towards europe .    3.2007242626702106
in europe , after the amoco cadiz , or the urquiola on the spanish coast , in 1976 , or the torrey canyon , in the same year , or the many other cases there have been , we really began to legislate after 1994 and 1995 , particularly in the last few years .    4.110080620090932
during these years , the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of UNK transport .    4.180233580182269
that is the reality .    3.207845557420862
in my opinion , we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems , also deriving from american legislation , which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector .    3.1315908521135705
i have referred to a series of issues which i will lay out in more detail , if you wish , in an appearance before a special committee on this matter , or when i present the actual initiatives in the coming months .    4.061420941942076
my intention is - and i insist - for us to begin discussions after the end of march , also coinciding with the council of ministers , and , of course , before the end of the six - month period of the portuguese presidency , for us to have texts to discuss .    4.2119119537387535
flags of convenience are one problem , but are not the only one .    4.40245139815181
the romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but , nevertheless , that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections ; more than the countries with flags of convenience .    3.5213162830109215
malta and cyprus have asked to join the community .    3.6145484504969647
we must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end .    4.729477894114317
this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the european union , and to deal with the notorious problem , which will no doubt arise again , of the aim of a community register .    4.7379343752357155
i believe that this will be difficult but , in any event , we should carry out a review of the registers of the european union countries .    4.948677647080971
we already have legislation .    3.085896052824363
according to the information which the commission services have given me , this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to a lack of personnel , means and inspectors .    3.8459141388481046
the problem is not that only 25 % are inspected , but rather how we select , how we find , the ships which constitute the highest risk , through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags .    3.2797020189886243
unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are UNK and the work is carried out more easily .    4.139771965490944
and that is why we have UNK ( the international convention for the safety of life at sea ) and marpol ( the international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships ) , two conventions of the international maritime organisation which will eventually have to be made mandatory in all member states of the union and whose application will have to be monitored .    3.773523350507238
with regard to the question of union inspectors , i believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the member states , which does not mean that the commission does not have to ensure that the states carry out their duty adequately .    4.250689554720132
lastly , i would like to stress the issue of liability . not only in terms of maximum sums insured , which i believe should be similar to those in the united states .    3.723509269990789
we have set a figure of usd UNK million ; in the united states they are talking about usd 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments .    3.487010023739196
i believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the united states , but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and , therefore , the liability of shipowners , and also to hold liable those who charter ships , which is to say the owners of the cargo .    4.277898525332088
unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable , we will never , in my opinion , resolve these problems .    3.514376529559742
i will end now .    3.0801293617193246
i will not expand further . we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions .    3.9946424943906935
but , obviously , as some speakers have said - and i thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where , within one , two or three years , we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done .    4.970125084065768
as for me , i can say , after having debated it in the college of commissioners , that the commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures , amendments and directives to parliament and the council , in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety .    4.766345297485495
the political will of this parliament is required - and i can see that i can count on this - as well as that of the council of ministers .    5.6384271799856975
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.894443415166077
we have taken good note of your intentions .    3.444971412310267
i have received 8 motions for resolution , in accordance with rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present commission statement .    2.9551026890737093
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.623621155697488
the next item is the commission statement on the storms in europe .    2.483920885195948
mr barnier has the floor on behalf of the commission .    3.1035767902067297
commissioner , i would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward , particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the european union , in terms of the help that we can offer them .    4.070140932471657
in the days immediately following this terrible storm i wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the french authorities to UNK the boundaries of objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in france and elsewhere could benefit from objective 2 .    3.7525703740163356
i think that you must have done so , because you have not mentioned it .    3.9271044139197837
in fact , we all know that anyone who does not live within the UNK of an objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid .    3.582153235033823
you also know that this will not only be a short - term problem , but also a medium and long - term one .    5.236001777058669
let me explain .    2.9275440244285087
i was in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20 % of UNK forest .    3.3228131043176217
indeed , for some ' forestry ' districts , which have lost 20 % of their trees , this represents a huge loss .    3.496162713127069
we know , for example , that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity , so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one , two or five years , but over many more .    3.761889017560351
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years .    3.8030699461078568
i think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial UNK .    3.301869118581686
i think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies .    3.8625503878306366
it is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one .    3.485021674465267
on the other hand , districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer , as the national forestry office has decided to freeze cuts in UNK for four years .    3.316332442945532
those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case .    3.300913213624095
i would also like to draw your attention to the fact that , although there has indeed been an economic disaster , the real ecological catastrophes are still to come .    3.2237386605675415
as you yourself said , commissioner , these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes , and we think that these are the first signs of climate change .    4.299954605537939
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact .    3.9407725332981176
mr president , everyone who has travelled here by car , train or aeroplane , has been able to see the extent of the damage , particularly in france , caused by UNK of a completely unprecedented violence which struck europe at the end of last month .    3.9220075636657197
what can the members of the european parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster ?    3.6533937844020787
firstly , i would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who , on a daily basis , have had to reassure their constituents , organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services .    3.4978234174771154
they have earned the confidence of their fellow - citizens .    3.2622828891693048
next , i would like to thank the emergency services and the armed forces of the union ' s member states who , in a fine example of intergovernmental cooperation , came to support the efforts of their french colleagues .    4.110486736912183
i would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid .    3.461132303502412
if this disaster had taken place in UNK or turkey , we could have immediately used the community budget to help the victims , but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so .    4.371082381912493
we must also ask the commission not to prevent local authorities and individual states from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying community competition rules too strictly .    3.4788901672568535
i am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies , which have been particularly badly hit .    3.1807657182003197
as you said , commissioner , we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced UNK in activity and that appeals can be made to UNK for investments that have been totally wiped out .    4.124127516633604
beyond this , i think that implementing magps in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected .    4.092883698726631
i therefore ask the commission to stop doing so and , on the contrary , to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments , which they urgently need .    3.5570461178959416
mr president , the storms which devastated france during the night between 26 and 27 december have caused , as has been said , 90 deaths and damage to a value of ff 75 billion , i . e . eur 11 billion .    2.963244782723841
almost three weeks after the disaster , several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones , 500 000 UNK of forestry land , or 100 million cubic metres of forest , have been ruined , and our historical heritage has also been affected , as the sad example of the park at the UNK of UNK demonstrates .    3.7736973348147966
it seems quite natural that given such a disaster , national and european solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected .    3.434946601513314
as the previous speakers have said , and as you said , commissioner , in response to my fellow member , mr martinez , with regard to another tragedy , the floods in november in the UNK of france , you have certainly noted these disasters with concern , but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued , which has resulted in this shocking paradox . this paradox , pointed out by the previous speaker , is that it is easier , a great deal easier , to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the union than within it .    4.309887155392382
we know full well that what you are doing , commissioner , and that is , limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the structural funds of the new objective 2 or from the provisional objectives 2 or 5b .    4.0377909925290565
these are the terms of the written answer you gave mr martinez on 11 january 2000 .    3.078913566717371
i can show you a copy if you wish .    3.4614589497267323
we would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the commission , but also of this parliament , and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so .    4.246902179315411
but for pity ' s sake , and i am not saying this to you in an aggressive way , please do not present appropriations which have previously been earmarked under an unrelated regional policy as aid for victims of the storms .    3.251492703840397
as a matter of urgency , therefore , we must restore , within the framework of a supplementary budget , the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters .    4.018520749004295
we must use the berlin summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the union . that , however , is another problem altogether .    3.901818445462145
i would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in UNK as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated europe in december .    2.957776048928573
these storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests .    3.201595196349563
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forests in my region , lorraine , which have suffered enormous destruction .    3.5161384281178925
i would like to congratulate the regional authorities , the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but , unfortunately , their UNK are not yet over .    3.803878062107924
i welcome mr barnier ' s statement and i also welcome the measures which the commission has announced .    4.173910071851302
i am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter , as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this .    3.7506403434352555
the community action programme for civil protection , established by a council decision on 9 december , was launched on 1 january 2000 .    3.674016285259017
i ask member states to grasp this opportunity . this programme must work at full capacity .    3.587953364653112
although it may have been effective in certain areas - and i do not doubt the sincerity of commissioner barnier ' s words - unfortunately it is still in its infancy when it comes to forestry .    4.318448298804222
our priority , as we wait for community - level funds to be freed up , is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between member states .    4.094730432150482
it is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads , and to repair them as quickly as possible .    2.9086096354204987
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure .    3.1427554146257775
our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of UNK problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest , and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood .    3.3796267684150925
finally , it is essential that we slow down the UNK of standing wood , in order to give priority to the purchase of UNK .    3.943315547804892
these timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in member states .    3.162024686843724
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .    3.9046999630155605
this is a very sad opportunity for europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies .    3.1151900382734232
it is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between member states in the face of an ecological and economic calamity .    3.1697489712291773
if this solidarity is to have been worthwhile , it is up to europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry .    4.0153550289596955
hurricane " lothar " should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking UNK once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too .    3.7932592778680725
current programmes must be accelerated .    3.6181160026745256
for example , as they stand , the commission ' s programmes will preclude us from meeting our obligations under kyoto .    3.8110437371480743
the trade in emissions rights is UNK to my mind and rather than solving the problem , it UNK it .    4.426770465711511
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term .    3.353405563281724
the new commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject , and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate !    3.8757805679385977
commissioner , mr president , lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto .    3.742775659335888
however , it has now achieved UNK .    3.1807444264479376
the hurricane of the same name swept across europe claiming numerous victims , mainly in france and germany , but also in switzerland , leaving a trail of destruction in its wake .    3.6408675342914445
the wind triumphed over electricity UNK , roofs , traffic signs and , ultimately over the forest .    3.0292945983263793
we have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately 120 million cubic metres of solid timber , and this is only an estimate .    3.330884790040101
i have listened to you very attentively commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in france and in germany .    3.511279814007761
if mrs schreyer is to visit the black forest UNK in the next few days , then any one farmer might ask her how the commission and europe would be able to help him as an individual .    4.358006140016141
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an objective 2 region , or in a 5b region ?    4.065050828728923
what answer will the commission give , when it is on the scene , when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam - building , and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc . ? all this is well - intentioned advice .    4.1236715134818045
however , i come from an area in northern germany where the forestry industry UNK and i can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage .    4.106426037068355
the UNK - out we need is not being attended to ; the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree .    3.430652662716936
what we need the commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid , so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date .    3.2571262424821907
mr president , commissioner , permit me , first of all , to make reference to two facts .    3.1574853316456455
we are now endeavouring , at huge cost , to get the country back on its feet again and help its people , and rightly so .    3.3264245436096846
secondly , at the end of 1999 unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast UNK of the eu .    3.4928032173582046
the commission in brussels responded to the victims ' UNK for help with a UNK of shoulders .    3.9586962971995248
" we do not have the wherewithal for that , " they said .    3.9412882250691226
this is wrong !    3.40415104766171
and no one can comprehend this attitude .    3.679378861258672
certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss .    3.3886777556640877
the citizens of the european union expect solidarity , also from within this community .    3.8540487774920655
i say they have a right to solidarity .    3.799006808119992
indeed the european parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need .    3.828072068973929
i urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms .    3.425993058328073
it knows the UNK and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .    3.5172404466650966
i call upon you , ladies and gentlemen , to support me in bringing home to the commission the fact that what most brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will .    3.6873120369549874
the european union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency .    2.9294440522461898
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal UNK .    3.1815493613847363
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment .    2.85590874491108
then , for example , people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart .    3.5469489673538575
when , in 1994 , over five years ago that is , i joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament , i became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier .    4.264234616276787
to this day i am still awaiting an initiative from the commission , which will actually enable me to start work .    3.8529953086152573
it is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste , and i hope that february does not see this dossier being postponed yet again !    3.6699332193312584
mr president , commissioner , the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should UNK us into thinking about certain problems .    2.6336944684545553
it has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters .    3.1637963496944566
there have always been natural disasters and there always will be .    3.3372431396007354
of course , there is a need for solidarity here .    3.232140745745529
there is certainly a need for european civil protection , and the eu budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters .    4.528790130066354
but , most importantly , it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature - mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature , for nature cannot make mistakes .    3.6351657952499807
the extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density , the type of infrastructure , and , of course , the many monocultures , if we are talking forests .    4.181138484700356
of course , i am in favour of providing assistance where we can .    3.6296120130019123
but when it comes to aid , we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future , more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone UNK underground .    3.4745192572131147
we must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation , rather than monocultures .    3.009118834393388
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate .    3.580881817831967
to this day , we in europe remain in the UNK position of having the gulf stream , and the gulf stream still does its stuff .    4.129841918618729
america and south - east asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go .    4.048001560495125
we are fortunate in having the gulf stream .    2.9528202418979013
but in common with others , we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect .    3.608745226183546
this is partly the work of human hand , as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations .    4.39272666537683
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the kyoto environmental conference .    3.6963785323642533
we must reduce co2 emissions , employ renewable energies , and generally make enquiries , in this connection , as to how the forests of europe are UNK .    3.502602693487416
mr president , i think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims .    2.709956929830235
this is an irreparable loss .    2.9373519556488312
secondly , we welcome the solidarity between the french departments and citizens , and the solidarity of other countries with france , which is the country worst affected .    4.339619198220794
as i have little time , mr president , i would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution .    3.4860284941653417
i believe that the first one was UNK recognised by the commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not .    3.3547675216199773
that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .    3.3490120103220287
in fact , over the last decade , the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century .    3.4184078863720493
therefore europe must be clearly committed to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposals .    3.900906531950293
secondly , i was rapporteur for civil protection in europe and i completely agree with the commissioner ' s proposal to create a european civil protection body .    4.068766330329111
furthermore , we should utilise an extraordinary budget line , since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation .    4.101963167099773
first of all , we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy .    3.6187048371809833
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by european standards .    3.0392343327952225
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this .    3.2144741021362453
i want to thank the commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at european level to give assistance to member states and regions that have tragedies like this .    3.5222533983019897
that is important .    2.607767873258657
the other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past .    4.26755117930972
it was very small .    3.2203842468109225
it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by members of this house proposing action when the disasters were not even major .    3.862507395696595
officials and ministers from member states were coming to brussels , UNK with the commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies .    4.125065057423414
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished .    3.5994422135552746
i think we should reinstate this budget line .    2.997227097182433
when we had the earthquake in greece , which was a big disaster , the community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greeks .    3.7120510493695575
the same when the floods came in france and the same again now .    3.638349158120858
these are major disasters , we should have an instrument , we do not have it .    4.720221590993857
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument .    3.404719532980645
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it .    3.637121192978931
we did not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the atlantic .    3.9619409260780194
we had floods in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffered from these .    3.8567690277266387
ladies and gentlemen , none of us must forget what has taken place .    3.419224076866754
it is true that there was a joint decision by the council and parliament seeking to UNK emergency lines .    3.4738892463564213
it is also true that there is a lot of european money around . commissioner barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development , forestry would be eligible under article 33 , companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in article 87 ( 2 ) of the treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the structural funds .    3.192333615108284
it is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .    3.1913149996773065
it is nothing more than the states playing at taking from peter in order to give to paul .    3.43409078717717
this is inadequate , and i am personally delighted that mr barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which , moreover , i expressed when i told the press in bordeaux what i am hoping for , and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of european civil security .    4.187178343767457
if the european citizenship that we all want to see is to come into being , if the mandate that our president , mrs fontaine has UNK on a closer relationship between the union and europe ' s citizens is to be effective , our citizens must be able to feel that we are acting with some urgency .    4.9981233538026775
i therefore believe that a european civil protection force , real civil relief blue UNK , who would go to areas in difficulty within the union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the union if needs be , in UNK or anywhere else , is something that we should hope to see . i would like to tell commissioner barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly european in spirit .    4.190020299364733
mr president , commissioner , when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation , we see that europe gets off relatively lightly .    3.405258356120587
nevertheless , the storms that took place in the last week of december showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us .    3.537137342790498
anyone travelling to strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in alsace as well .    3.3244876928346416
i would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so UNK , and at the same time , from my position here in this chamber , point to how important it is to support these regions and people .    4.06702213262867
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible .    3.011131820048811
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long .    3.7210286146653067
for instance , it should be pointed out that fallen timber provides the best breeding ground for the UNK UNK ' s UNK , and we are not yet in a position to assess the repercussions this will have .    4.915909144700707
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the UNK weather arrives .    3.052225667768541
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow .    3.866215054353567
the calculations are in decades rather than years .    3.136959920628123
in addition , i would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production , for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a UNK against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions .    3.1254104764785744
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
mr president , i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms .    3.2512844093536453
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries .    4.492953468548192
we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank .    3.0935508925134463
i was asked to highlight the result of the storms in ireland .    4.09179405110804
we had high winds and unprecedented , prolonged rainfall which , adding to existing difficulties , resulted in thousands of UNK being UNK , sometimes , in up to 15 feet of water .    2.870612860812705
we experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms , no sanitation , no drinking water and the environmental disasters of e . UNK - infected water .    3.0857270611833867
i talked with farmers whose UNK were UNK their UNK due to drinking the infected water .    3.044357021606299
natural habitats were destroyed .    3.7508141732329867
so i ask that ireland be remembered in this particular case .    3.2230709622536438
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force .    3.417981484239675
mr president , commissioner , i second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims .    3.036848564768345
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe .    3.5445358786005623
for the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of europe , and i believe we need , in the long - term , to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future .    4.554061987725244
we certainly do not want market organisation for forests , but maybe we should set up a system , perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector , which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way .    3.9028212974135292
unfortunately , we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future .    3.897778521858788
of course , the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet , but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to UNK greenhouse gases as we are doing , these storms will , of course , hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century .    3.8562803679723787
i believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this chamber by a former fellow mep of ours , UNK UNK . he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women , we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect - he proposed the oil companies at the time .    3.973918542950358
however , an exception should certainly be made in the case of shell and UNK , for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate , rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability .    3.660977173635459
we must be aware of this connection ; i do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm , but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course !    3.865580609999326
i have received seven motions for resolutions tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .    1.9849126687226595
that concludes the debate .    2.1467925807151658
the vote will be taken at noon on thursday .    2.9808477754500697
food safety    4.428069989205333
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission .    3.2872013995440397
mr president , i am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to parliament the main lines of the commission ' s white paper on food safety , adopted on wednesday last , 12 january , in association with my colleague , mr liikanen .    3.2145902846403005
at my hearing last september , i promised speedy delivery of this white paper .    3.0235782868117638
i am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly .    3.6173224768500476
the white paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new commission was appointed last september .    3.072204698019206
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the commission ' s green paper on food law was published .    3.9448351557746695
equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge , as well as the bse crisis .    3.036844698093568
i do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in europe ' s food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months .    3.4978328026533263
the commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up - to - date and effective food safety regime in the world .    2.846512987709882
when i launched the white paper last week i said that the shopping UNK is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth .    3.7308691187637395
the most UNK decisions are made by the consumers of europe .    3.5757469468041325
if their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions . this in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers , producers and industry generally .    3.2020580447578646
in an industry worth some eur 600 billion annually , even a slight UNK in confidence levels can have significant effects .    3.0731470854747167
between the UNK - food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .    3.6536475203379903
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness .    3.373141180772586
this crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and european level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety .    3.126171461197836
in saying all of this , i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .    4.31213419694821
the challenge is to make the system the very best .    4.078850495367606
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food .    3.51182562446586
we are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change .    2.8358198959604586
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule .    3.6600962298162307
we will also need the fullest support from the council and other key stakeholders .    4.047471547775559
the white paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation .    2.692186295467748
all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent , understandable and flexible .    3.7799909707854313
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers .    3.232981937446409
the detailed action plan on food safety in the white paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years .    3.5215216091324173
over 80 measures are envisaged .    3.4264954528654523
our objective is to put in place a coherent and up - to - date body of food law by the end of 2002 .    3.4461648880995015
we are also envisaging the establishment of a european food authority by 2002 as an essential complement to the new food safety regime .    3.3299250438624135
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate .    3.851350789285127
it has already attracted much comment , including reactions from members of parliament .    2.7902938269949775
the chapter of the white paper devoted to the establishment of a european food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments .    3.219708594787642
we are seeking views by the end of april on what we envisage .    3.6221918855347988
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moments .    4.186804111825141
the commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of UNK the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence .    3.713359081711781
the first key concern is independence .    3.0623342683462815
key stakeholders , including consumers , are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests .    3.2648797338227316
we must also ensure excellence and transparency .    2.663173018132761
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the bse crisis .    2.979618140753205
however , the commission believes that we must go further .    4.027627956515774
we must create a permanent and truly independent , excellent and transparent system of risk assessment .    2.8404534603147535
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety .    3.7156340192123714
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority .    3.6280258370540284
they may not be transferred in their present form or structure - this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority ' s establishment .    3.8022979204311973
however , if we were merely to propose a simple moving of UNK , this would clearly not be enough .    4.278905044954502
as the white paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value - added structure .    4.126343731587768
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened .    3.459163181852976
within the authority i envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists .    3.580106113696603
i am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime - anticipate rather than react , identify issues before they become crises .    2.9193162742500967
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority .    3.1464629262098893
to be proactive the white paper identifies a number of new areas that would be UNK by the authority .    5.000653169600097
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function , the coordination of scientific information in the eu , and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states .    3.0185531009036635
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns .    3.1550095205141764
the commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority .    3.257994238631951
we believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the commission , parliament and council .    3.42372898682776
i make no apology for this approach ; i firmly believe that it is the correct one .    4.091787874422377
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law - making powers to such an authority .    3.586916714607648
i do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion .    3.0879245486110793
it was only last year that the treaty was amended to give parliament a much greater role in the legislative process .    3.902027999795599
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be , in my view , a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability .    3.6703183112364486
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter .    3.763977161116233
there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority .    4.051727162334677
i also reject this line of argument .    3.1276153829875373
how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well - founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?    3.5200121158826607
would this be in the interests of europe ' s citizens ?    4.535002747992409
in my view , most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based , rationally argued and fully justified .    2.889873178582337
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving .    2.937930627405162
i can assure you here today that the commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .    3.6906231840358035
i have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the member states .    2.8255882963126755
this is a major task .    2.971931696162644
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the european union .    3.06560540447994
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .    3.3339639173093882
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself .    3.368799761997122
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science .    3.367712904131805
however , with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies , the authority will become pre - UNK on the european stage .    4.150246204512282
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard .    3.2236011549894563
as an integral part of a value - added structure , the white paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication : to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer - friendly way ; to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up - to - the - minute data on risk ; to be highly visible ; to tell the good news story about food ; to be proactive .    3.7306676235183462
the white paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls .    3.588617452766686
this is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that member states and operators are complying with community legislation .    3.6254267313270203
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena .    3.209739357431076
in this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in dublin .    3.2905013675653274
this revised community framework would have three core elements : operational criteria set up at community level , community control guidelines , and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control .    3.4783294488398218
these could include UNK community financial support or UNK funding already committed to a member state .    3.141945426172788
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , UNK and residues , novel food , additives , UNK , packaging and UNK .    3.4559281873435173
it will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers , farmers and food operators , traceability of feed , food and ingredients , proper risk analysis through , for instance , risk assessment - that is , scientific advice and information analysis - risk management - that is , regulation and control - risk communication , and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate .    3.647450604638852
as regards the precautionary principle , i might add that the commission is currently UNK a communication which i expect to be adopted very soon .    4.3743346873791
i look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the members of parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available .    3.458256282439009
however , having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees , i recognise that this was not feasible .    3.4984566390864704
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .    4.032099217249046
parliament played a crucial role in europe ' s response to the bse crisis .    4.026106896867143
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens ' concerns about food safety issues to the fore .    3.0881616425021687
i expect that parliament ' s contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive .    3.7233380880746876
while we have a number of months to the end of april to debate the issue and UNK our views , i recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe .    4.854939565700076
i would therefore ask parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible .    3.061370821345603
it is essential that the commission should have the benefit of parliament ' s contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the european union ' s food safety regime .    3.7490919531531635
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu ' s food safety regime in the years ahead .    3.3881302122526544
it is essential that we get the mix right .    2.914920891989358
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .    2.507489937120012
i would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the european institutions , including the commission and parliament .    3.965004150901771
that is very much the right approach .    3.4062931433765065
but there is one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight .    3.987765674331891
i hope that we can UNK this out .    3.0785309064061988
we need a body of food law , as you have said , and we need to agree this together .    4.174584001798365
it is very important that we include liability in that process .    2.777814346833043
that is the one word i am talking about .    3.387128463390579
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong .    3.0220665438519614
that cannot continue .    3.4723632077539683
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .    4.291160344462692
mr president , it is a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority .    3.2200448836687716
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed .    3.5536968324302576
you are unclear about this in your white paper .    3.229309255232753
what is your schedule , how long will it take you to produce a positive list ?    3.2756482127130204
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof ?    3.476153297973888
the final part of my question is as follows : when will bse testing be binding in all member states ?    3.608018776710588
thank you , commissioner , for your statement .    2.707099169369172
i think the lines that you have set up regarding the food safety authority are a recognition of reality .    3.4171636135645254
the member states would not accept a regulatory agency , so there is not very much point in your proposing one .    3.8607961432700058
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .    4.21762148237079
however , as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years , i have to ask : if europe has the safest food control system , as you have said , why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives ?    3.779497516604929
secondly , will this not compound the problem of over - regulation from brussels and under - implementation in the member states ?    4.015508703506243
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this .    3.0820961023551496
regarding enlargement : what plans does the commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws , given that the commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the white paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003 ?    3.821469408497924
president , first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern , mrs roth - behrendt and mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper .    3.2706057074167756
i find that encouraging and i look forward to further discussions with them and other members of parliament in relation to the issues that they raised .    4.311861050338283
mrs ahern raised the issue of liability .    3.1724975685762065
that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .    4.729303909965262
once that is done , issues such as liability can be addressed .    3.501081122038452
i have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background , but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved .    3.6039124401460487
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration .    4.101205818482393
mrs roth - behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list .    3.0968500306229227
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .    4.3027431490356385
at the moment the list is , as i say , a negative list and it is added to as required .    4.360269593276767
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it , 2002 in fact .    3.9431912148815593
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .    3.5647052019661287
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed .    3.7655536147339497
this is unfortunate and it is wrong , and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done .    4.551721850353576
the work in relation to bse in member states and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of UNK in member states is ongoing , i know that mrs roth - behrendt has asked me this question before and i said i thought it was coming along quickly but i understand it is in inter - service consultation in the commission and work is currently under way .    4.536280430376079
mrs jackson has focused on the fact that there are 24 new and 20 amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over - regulation .    3.439415032992621
i should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation .    3.9084870917865677
it is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .    3.597517864675371
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind .    4.1685892069993615
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that i have drawn to the attention of mr verheugen .    4.5314829691522585
commissioner , the ignorance of certain member states has landed us in a major food crisis here in europe , and i am afraid that once more i have cause to be UNK at the fact that again no members of the council are in UNK , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .    4.790502239164035
what i would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind , whatever name it goes by , will be given influence over the council , who in this authority will have the say in matters , and who will issue orders .    4.359148774649852
of course , we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content , but i would insist on parliament retaining the rights accorded it under maastricht and amsterdam , and even extending them .    3.4386409848262174
i very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through europe anonymously like a satellite ; an authority of this kind would be UNK to me and i hope it does not come to that .    4.183431414965845
i also welcome the white paper .    2.7944077915948635
but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and france ' s refusal to lift the ban ?    3.7462478279311777
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting .    3.6978713391189273
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment ?    4.408631409957079
mr president , you said during last week ' s information session that it was your view that any future eu food agency should not be located on the periphery , but you did not mention what that periphery was .    3.6542285843071616
for example , the work of the eu unit located in dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters .    3.5307081054293348
it has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather , publish and coordinate data , make recommendations for improved food safety , and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers .    3.6164798202446535
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union .    3.6290229703508063
i would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location ?    3.055416738940892
in relation to the makeup of the authority : first of all it will employ in - house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time .    3.4833636849403797
in addition to that , the food safety authority will have a board .    3.6740921147289938
you will notice in the white paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board .    4.1020844974615
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months .    3.1418998310184936
i envisage that the board ' s membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders .    3.4778893376659896
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september .    4.672276168332462
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september .    3.882083700980141
that would UNK the independence of the scientific advice .    3.3311500068472646
but it would have an overall remit , particularly , for instance , in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research .    3.7314667484254587
mr florenz asks whether parliament will have a say in that .    3.7366140228361604
that is an issue for consideration and discussion .    3.189393165309036
there may be a number of views on that .    4.225221766439962
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for parliament or members of parliament - or indeed parliament nominees - to be members of the board .    3.8887549809247135
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if parliament , through nominees or even meps themselves , were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated .    3.578200073320049
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out .    3.716938227634687
mr florenz also raised the question of UNK .    3.748625344974968
i am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile .    4.0117074980447125
it must be visible .    2.603729633259479
it must be known .    3.149305794707457
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority .    4.277259324682556
the UNK of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known , who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food , particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to UNK , UNK and such issues , so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority .    4.0714860734055645
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some UNK of confidence already built up in the UNK from the authority .    4.284881676354041
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not UNK .    3.5692057377438715
it must be visible .    2.603729633259479
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority .    3.546835582397011
mrs lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth .    3.407332322552506
i suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in member states begin and end .    4.256526113448677
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level .    4.296989357405216
quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for , or advising , the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level .    2.917625082024629
that is an undesirable situation , we do not want that situation in the future .    3.944233152281189
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence - lack of information is one .    2.911894659064668
but information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern .    3.5657738318041643
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists , that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at community level has the opportunity and is UNK to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all member states and indeed maybe even beyond , where experts are to be found elsewhere .    4.27507060329391
over time , as i said a moment ago , not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise , its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged .    3.7447540403459127
this situation can be achieved over a period of time .    3.2504260413161776
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence . it is something that is earned over a period of time .    3.6699033565246877
however , the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the commission , parliament and council .    4.033709564406335
i realise that this is a somewhat time - consuming exercise but , nonetheless , the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the authority is - i believe - the way forward .    4.546369145704366
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way .    3.690845675888057
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance .    3.59272037281601
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process .    3.525506744735703
in relation to grants and subsidies : yes , consideration has been given to that issue .    3.0859686383825156
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought , particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with community law pending a court ruling .    3.578117648950817
in relation to mrs lynne ' s question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates to budget issues .    3.8086902540334107
mrs UNK then asked me about the location of the authority .    3.065262666691282
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .    3.917593006035491
i recognise that the UNK is located in dublin and , although i come from that part of the world myself , i have to accept that it is not the centre of europe !    5.968689126017228
but the fvo is in quite a different situation from the food safety authority .    2.7935048140592267
the fvo is made up of independent scientists and UNK and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport - quite clearly we have an airport in dublin .    4.140939300600085
the food safety authority ' s situation is quite different .    3.4941464785673104
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the UNK of legislation .    4.754595760315846
an important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean , what problems they have identified , what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise .    4.1255159015460645
equally , the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy - making process or the law - drafting process , to ensure that the legislation meets the UNK that they have identified .    4.1336340294051395
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located .    3.3495198113822027
scientists will be employed in - house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the commission and council are based .    4.667246013002339
that is my judgement at the moment .    2.9548639374269925
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and i will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery .    3.323498136951283
colleagues , i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda .    4.470527699383604
i would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the conference of presidents .    3.7975658326659976
if you feel that these sessions after a commission statement are important , i would suggest that we require more time than the half - hour that is allocated to them .    3.7373605158838337
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had 29 minutes of response by the commissioner , and his statement .    4.751819654287584
as you can see , half - an - hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session .    3.1378673028100863
i hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the commission on such future occasions .    3.7721920251820924
that concludes the debate .    2.1467925807151658
the next item is question time ( b5 - 0003 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the commission .    2.070446646956666
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to question time .    2.715595323958186
mr purvis has the floor for a procedural motion .    2.6879083254844995
i object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for question time ; it is one of the few occasions when UNK have a chance to get their time on the floor and i do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda .    3.9965374224241095
that is the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda .    4.3393263422235675
the fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5 . 30 p . m . , and you can see the clock .    3.920904384482701
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event .    3.9833840155556572
first part    3.4826430781408737
question no 28 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.20310316897198
subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake - prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than 7 on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey ' s persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .    1.5215876152247458
turkey ' s nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey ' s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan .    1.7401361680913656
what steps will the commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget ?    1.929959923921427
mr verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.9771438316495202
the commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in akkuyu , turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards .    3.458156588213457
according to our information , the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet .    3.914684244913462
the commission acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the UNK , construction , UNK , operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in turkey rests entirely with the turkish atomic energy authority .    3.309202687874896
the commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production , including the nuclear option .    3.6307744500438335
in particular , the commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the UNK fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site .    4.1144110534523275
according to information received from the international atomic agency , the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in june 1998 in UNK .    3.6484548304282045
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site .    4.226699758530096
the commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons - grade material .    3.1296104946663164
it acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the non - proliferation of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency .    3.3786150186286057
thank you for your reply .    2.2516137870648967
i should like to make the following points : turkey is now a candidate country .    3.148116250769136
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by 2 % .    2.914265107239645
at the same time , it also wishes to acquire UNK type reactors from canada , which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and india .    3.292489354389446
in this sense , there is therefore a serious risk that some UNK will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the caucasus calls for a UNK country with weapons grade nuclear technology .    4.10603707067014
so much for the political aspect .    3.2285793934682214
now to the technical aspect . the safety factor in this type of project , and i am speaking as an engineer , has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty .    3.91318052607338
in cases such as this , where there is uncertainty , simulators are used .    3.3087774059257744
however , we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy .    2.77383999062785
in this sense , all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this .    2.868523763359679
therefore , and given that the relationship between the european union and the commission and turkey has now changed , it would be a good idea if turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of turkey within the european union .    3.8839901382764146
a couple of weeks ago we had a debate in parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries .    3.91877768126178
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety .    3.6103371463591065
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be UNK .    3.30987366530609
in the case of turkey it is different .    3.089016270390578
the plant is not yet there .    4.137069094946656
i have already said that turkey is part of the UNK and of the convention on nuclear safety .    4.244497574314624
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with turkey .    3.8493942883721077
if the conclusion is that turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal european safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with lithuania , UNK and bulgaria .    3.614855006996239
mr president , the commissioner said that turkey has signed the non - proliferation treaty , it has signed the nuclear safety treaties : why should there be any doubt at all but that turkey ' s nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the community , and would the commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with mr souladakis on this matter ?    3.9504994956683332
i think it is the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears .    4.279712344234556
i do not have these concerns .    3.228144631510302
i believe that turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non - proliferation treaty , but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in europe and i think it is quite right to discuss them here in parliament .    3.977513117176237
question no 29 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.177609381891025
subject : depleted uranium weapons has the commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon eu states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the kosovan conflict ?    2.975528772485561
if not , why not ?    2.4668352110934655
mrs wallström has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.9301498999051834
the european commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action .    3.6971156377057848
as early as last june the commission financed a first study . it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and concluded that there had been no large - scale ecological catastrophe .    3.4241656183159312
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has UNK that original assessment .    3.407700692786887
the commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the united nations environment programme - balkan task force .    3.6619113141969106
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet studied it .    3.9055227276667908
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net .    3.8898917331373006
the balkan task force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict .    3.7101344575324107
no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the UNK fact - finding mission .    2.8762540853433647
however , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .    2.925729496259608
from a desk assessment UNK with a fact - finding mission the report concludes that the risks , if any , are limited to an area around the target .    3.3250819811931835
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south - eastern europe . a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed .    3.6729684417440853
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed .    3.219509735523021
first of all , mr president , can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response .    4.181520014913833
clearly the commission has given some consideration to this problem and i am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue .    4.689810720619299
but i would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used .    3.386678068959359
this uranium becomes air - borne , is UNK and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in kosovo with rather more long - term effects than it has been possible to establish so far .    3.837944625549496
this seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the gulf war .    3.224892716612205
i would therefore ask the commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long - term effects , not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a UNK way within kosovo ?    4.068893638635734
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons ?    4.12322327129632
thank you , mr bowe , for that question .    3.0887300885781253
we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean - up of kosovo .    3.3551092695782954
but those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium .    3.861811145388399
that is also mentioned in the report .    3.0414135355035348
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia .    3.463736398232942
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted .    3.8610502588378757
a big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .    4.69188083414681
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is , for the time being , the kind of frame we can use for the work of the european union .    4.179125334536678
it is important to follow up and it gives the member states , as well as the united nations and the commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military UNK and their effects on the environment .    4.661375685497147
it also has a long - term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons .    3.6413742105785443
mr president , commissioner , in a few months ' time , hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday .    2.725237040129233
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast .    2.698292307849825
are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this summer , and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect ?    3.8411014412078934
we make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this .    3.1819497277783078
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do .    2.959682587278842
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .    3.706251036919044
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution .    3.618785156342717
that also includes UNK and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system .    4.012409549149721
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean - up exercise .    4.534393309822526
i wanted to ask the commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the nato armed forces now UNK in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area ?    4.381905502831377
i cannot answer that question .    2.9779175151939836
what we know from the environmental side is what i have already mentioned , that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan , but when it comes to medical check - ups i do not have the information about that .    4.251697012325984
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information .    3.5439101025566053
question no 30 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.179845451100713
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile received over UNK tibetans who escaped over the UNK mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .    3.2208339211418524
many of the refugees had been severely frost - UNK and many had died along the way .    3.2496821741153634
the tibet intergroup is very concerned about the UNK situation in tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the european union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by tibetans daily in tibet .    4.109181305944175
the tibet intergroup , therefore , UNK concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in tibet and supporting the dalai lama ? s proposal for dialogue with the chinese government to resolve the situation in tibet , calls on the commission to appoint a special envoy for tibet to address the concerns of the european union and to help bring the tibetan and chinese authorities together for dialogue .    4.078287277144036
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet ?    2.8019127917550652
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.2909767628058004
the concerns expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared .    3.6449179527687297
i have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues , including tibet , firmly and UNK to the chinese authorities .    3.614001595848181
the european union did that at the european UNK summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on a number of human rights issues , including tibet .    4.050971873673881
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama .    3.1893115700310988
i urge the chinese again to do so .    2.9304363568054264
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities .    2.793757214613859
we are also doing a number of other things : in the european union - china human rights dialogue , we have focused on a number of practical steps , including sending experts on assignment to tibet , planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health , education and training for tibetans .    3.771460907291729
the appointment of an eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them .    3.5981908093503088
but for my part , i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts .    3.739459639076452
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the tibetan community in exile .    3.447006876481872
i am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys , however worthy the cause .    3.352023283204402
mr president , mr patten , of course , you are very well - qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in china , and you are well aware of how hard the tibetans are trying to initiate a debate , something which has always been blocked hitherto .    4.379147191114144
however , if your response was to be that we should turn to " mr cfsp " , that is , to mr solana , then i fear that this would constitute a one - sided approach to an external policy matter .    4.143294618457076
your approach , which i am very much in favour of , since it is a coherent one , takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights ; i wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights .    4.845575231198311
imprisonment , torture , the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth , are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum .    3.486545138642422
if we cut down here and say that the council now shares responsibility for this , then i fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve .    4.026480117308056
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the european commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the council .    4.9788640819771555
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is .    3.5120165594198207
i stated nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the council .    3.4315508361818217
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course .    3.5448528588171455
putting that on one side , because that is the situation , it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues .    4.503051270628967
i am very much hoping in the next few months that the commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out , among other things , that there is no UNK whatsoever between a regard for human rights in china or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the european union .    3.8281008226640583
i have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most UNK - everywhere in the world .    3.1292139113304063
i repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet .    3.9297091416405316
during the few months that i have been a commissioner that has happened twice , first of all in new york at our meeting with minister UNK and most recently at the meeting in peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest .    4.137934334229237
if i can make a literary UNK to the honourable member , who i recognise is interested in these subjects , i recommend to him a book published just before christmas written by isabel UNK , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of tibet .    3.9678696418462067
mr president , i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan UNK , which UNK peace and UNK .    3.030390634879707
we are not just talking about human rights and the environment where tibet is concerned , rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace , UNK , UNK - as the dalai lama would say - to us europeans .    4.008886730955785
the question before us now is what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his UNK , the dalai lama ' s , proposal for a peaceful solution to the tibet affair ?    4.082141269593311
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people .    3.7787537745925333
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural heritage and about the UNK tradition .    3.489922157236177
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama .    3.1620195166564904
it is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .    3.6134057541228217
the commission , like others , has urged dialogue .    3.5376987109373217
the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes .    3.5875034540140662
i wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama .    3.01612873699382
at or around the time of president clinton ' s visit to china , the president of the people ' s republic of china gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda .    3.635774461482978
it would be very beneficial , not just for tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in asia , but it would also be greatly to the credit of the government of the people ' s republic of china if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue .    4.0441720881040455
question no 31 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.213590064682254
subject : commission ' s rejection of legislation on proper administration in the eu according to newspaper reports , the commission has rejected the proposal by eu ombudsman jacob söderman for a citizens ? right to proper administration in the eu .    3.476930104116528
although the commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration , it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made , but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service .    4.086056725509806
are these reports accurate ?    3.568543112460334
what is the reason for the commission ? s acting in this way , and how can it explain the UNK discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of eu administration ?    4.256789195892752
does the commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five - point programme agreed between parliament and the commission in september , and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows parliament to express an opinion on it ?    3.6682072484700123
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.2909767628058004
the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate .    3.2789960482870257
in november 1999 the commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its rules of procedure .    3.657148697420876
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .    4.039707575927449
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading .    2.947516780521021
the commission would like to stress in particular that , in the drafting of the code , it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the european ombudsman .    4.926266937343581
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the commission ' s administration with the public .    4.493369228140613
it will be adopted through a legally - binding commission decision to be published in the official journal of the european communities .    3.4802388548875056
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the european ombudsman ' s office .    4.538295228679019
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself .    3.9726057884234374
however , it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform .    4.010908792793018
mr president , i would like to thank the commissioner .    2.4078365073347365
however , i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force , bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 1997 .    4.174733928082017
the newspaper reports were misleading .    2.890553862483611
i do not think there is any difference between us and the ombudsman .    3.5760597040049356
there is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and i think we are soundly placed on that .    4.073149758010215
i want to repeat that honourable members , like the honourable member who asked the question , who take a particular interest in this issue , will want to have a dialogue about it .    4.397741216625091
it is extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member .    3.3078057059152566
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer .    3.366955341207177
for safety ' s sake , i should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that , where the commission and good administration are concerned , there is no part of jacob söderman ' s proposal which the commission thinks is unacceptable .    4.673339371155083
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved ?    3.676611040051001
let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true ! " i would like to stress again that the commission has accepted all the ombudsman ' s recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 1999 " .    4.236962865520437
both documents , that is the commission ' s document and the ombudsman ' s draft , cover largely the same ground .    4.021034518916249
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .    3.133690404230015
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all UNK with the ombudsman on this important issue .    4.140862527624412
we will be happy to incorporate mr patten ' s notes into the bibliography , as another UNK book for the members to bear in mind .    3.2795442601887848
as the author is not present , question no 32 lapses .    2.5772663502980917
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy . i am sorry .    3.936299065836596
according to the rules of procedure , you are not required to reply .    3.639119734074111
i wish you a good evening .    2.989969346084427
second part    3.4079218452523494
questions to mr nielson , who is replaced by mr patten    4.439124917028837
can i first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague , mr nielson , was that he could not be here but the honourable members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is , trying to ensure that our agreement with south africa UNK .    3.687785948830181
the commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development , part of the so - called UNK courses for new staff , something that has been done already but not , i admit , on a regular basis .    3.84459118558061
the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point .    3.38956976060872
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory .    3.0888692725017046
we also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management .    3.2674736662817505
as far as possible , we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset , instead of having to be tackled separately and later .    3.5970666384446983
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add - on .    3.5428941717701887
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the directorate - general for development at all levels .    3.3252323549900735
it is not to be brought in as a " sort of optional add - on " .    3.12359443773142
this must naturally lead to a UNK of development goals and strategies , together with a transformation of institutions and processes so that both women ' s and men ' s priorities and needs are better reflected .    3.988890244957116
in addition , measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender .    3.29387888489793
equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals , action plans and strategies .    3.249290363933808
however , responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with UNK and unit managers .    3.3855464712106498
if the latter do not have the required professional competence , then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority .    3.3996230102064513
extremely few members of the directorate - general for development , that is to say unit managers and more senior managers , have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised .    3.8465941423759955
only one manager has participated in gender training , and for half a day .    3.6455663550741586
that is naturally unacceptable .    3.2208100826049915
what is the commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training ?    3.1749599595521123
gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees , but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course .    3.6675653107517974
this limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .    3.5031424888407354
as i point out in my question , one to two days , and not one to two hours , need to be devoted to the subject .    4.3084644682933515
my question is this : is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the directorate - general for development ?    3.135656575911098
well i certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson .    3.1435207854132674
i must not go on about books , but i have just been reading the book by david UNK UNK on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues , in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies , going back UNK .    3.960996437361744
secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the commission - it should be essential . and , since it should be essential , i would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .    5.287053576721062
that goes for everybody at whatever level of UNK .    3.1576812774392082
it is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their UNK but think that they are too grown - up or too senior to receive themselves .    3.0676932452885173
thirdly , one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross - cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground .    3.627906543660656
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said .    2.9014005792176722
i hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates UNK and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves .    3.7498512909205983
since 1991 , the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia .    4.267310041929202
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme .    3.410818531062314
in 1998 and 1999 kyrgyzstan , UNK , uzbekistan and turkmenistan received technical assistance of eur 75 million .    3.167992598220013
this assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors , in particular agriculture , infrastructure development , the private economy and the strengthening of institutions .    4.019390867375639
security considerations have prevented tajikistan from benefiting fully from tacis but a rehabilitation programme of eur 7 . 2 million has been in place in 1998 and 1999 .    3.3970053363575183
in addition to national programmes , the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy , transport and environmental sectors .    4.070372727222108
food security programmes in central asia began in 1996 , following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind .    3.9877185667613806
these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent , tajikistan .    3.29829808679291
funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur 7 . 42 million in 1998 and 1999 .    2.9117130810032186
over the same period , kyrgyzstan received eur 17 million .    2.7776732156269865
since 1993 the commission ' s european community humanitarian office , echo , has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan .    3.744041815111993
in 1998 and 1999 eur 3 . 8 million was granted to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received over eur 35 million , mainly for food , medical supplies , water and sanitation .    2.8008599048169716
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .    3.8493050183801714
mr president , commissioner , there is a risk of central asia and the UNK sea becoming the balkans of the 21st century .    3.2417761975099757
that is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of turkmenistan and uzbekistan in particular . that is why i would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence , how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going , that is , with regard to political relations that is .    4.144125868820681
of course , that falls within your remit ; my next question falls within mr nielson ' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation , in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the UNK monocultures , which are the cause of great UNK .    3.994263695649485
we were able , at the UNK summit a couple of weeks ago , to meet and have discussions with some of the central asian republics .    3.9097504440607094
i am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them .    3.7305268652527226
i can send the honourable member , if he would like , a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the central asian republics .    3.5324397464705597
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the UNK side .    4.000605557260995
but i have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of central asia .    3.6918853465018278
i have heard the honourable member talk in the past about the caucasus as well .    3.583019089346843
he is absolutely right to say that a union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much UNK in the balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise , had we taken more pre - UNK measures if those had been possible .    4.370839323811652
so the honourable member ' s remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made .    3.8311553826594777
we are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact .    3.8375601431094126
our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty UNK .    3.7473316593926316
those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of UNK the land .    3.7382038124931967
there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to .    4.084121489072454
we also take good note of the fact that the member who has asked the question has applauded the commissioner ' s answer .    3.7477430984683306
this is not the usual state of affairs .    2.8285655821185047
and furthermore the commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time .    3.4344940856579855
thank you very much , mr patten , for your interventions today .    2.80387545167953
subject : greek action plan for employment according to the findings of the evaluation of action plans for employment , greece and italy are the main targets for criticism from the commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies .    3.802030865135621
the report states that in greece and italy targets for improving ? employability ? have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long - term unemployment to be complied with .    3.5357885405835274
the report also comments that in greece there are no plans for medium to long - term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges , or for the satisfactory use of european social fund resources to support employment policies , and , in addition , that there are no exact employment figures .    3.84447290282599
could the commission say whether the greek government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long - term unemployment , and what these commitments are ? has the government UNK for and put into place a suitable system for UNK , recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work ?    3.7278767117730904
as far as mr papayannakis ' question is concerned , in the 1999 action plan for employment , the commission proposed certain recommendations for greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the action plan for employment .    4.110568542357149
the most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services , where problems exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the action plan for employment .    3.5719570151839823
the greek government introduced two specific programmes in 1999 as part of its employment policy : " yes to work " and " back to work " .    3.393741994053977
we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .    3.421862866352986
the greek government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed , firstly , to restructuring public sector employment services in greece , secondly , to setting up efficient employment promotion centres - this programme has already started but has not yet been completed - and , thirdly , to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable it systems to monitor all these policies .    3.458241927718354
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it UNK the commitments which it has made .    4.2439912675242875
thank you , commissioner for your reply .    2.744579425902612
however , our current situation is as follows : at 11 . 3 % , we have the second highest unemployment in europe , which was not previously the case , we have the biggest increase in unemployment , we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed , i . e . less than 1 % of gdp , while other countries , such as france , belgium and germany spend 3 - 4 % , and it is not clear how the money received from the social fund has been used , inter alia , to combat unemployment .    4.186651422210903
you tell me that you , as the commission , have made recommendations .    5.0847701602711215
i understand and welcome that and i hope that the recommendations will be adhered to .    3.544376490786688
however , my question for a very long time has been this : what happened with previous policies ?    3.475906522419753
did anyone find work ?    3.438616677978343
how many people found work ?    3.046025567711227
if you cannot tell us for this year , then last year and the year before .    3.997393649094028
what has been done about training ?    4.05238366803665
is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for UNK or trainees ?    3.3478935111176917
do we have any figures ?    3.435407660296754
in other words , do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in greece ?    3.546014085499986
mr papayannakis , the only answer i can give you is that the greek government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned , and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies .    3.9296930647513397
greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and , as far as i can see , an increase in productivity .    4.192532998861364
the action which the commission can take relates to the specific guidelines .    5.094531348033305
as you know , there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated .    3.229918952165073
they concern access to training , the ratio of men to women with access to training , and special action for the long - term unemployed .    3.35379814259772
the commission will endeavour , for all these specific guidelines , to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new community framework for 2000 to 2006 .    3.881515964222351
question no 36 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8561700457994672
the danish pension scheme , the efterløn , only allows people resident in denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in denmark to retire .    3.286756750019228
some workers have complained to the european commission because they do not have the right to retire .    4.7791313555579436
the danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under danish law .    3.4331152398938753
it should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are , however , still pending before the council .    4.726451851859135
there is , as yet , no european court case law on efterløn , but it could UNK be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality .    3.180201404550399
the commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the danish government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach .    4.089389104260731
the last meeting on the subject was held in november 1999 and we are waiting for the commission services ' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against denmark .    4.1897581474171135
i noticed that the commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the commission , but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been .    4.040970075435547
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the commission .    3.239006377563036
the commissioner also more than hinted , of course , that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the danish early retirement pension scheme before the court of justice in luxembourg , specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually UNK against non - danish wage UNK who are unable to fulfil the conditions , due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the danish system .    3.8386682209811225
i should like to ask the commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter , for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the danish socio - political debate .    3.47831881097436
so i should be grateful if the commissioner could enlarge upon this question .    2.5825783947549295
honourable member , i should just like to stress that both denmark and numerous other member states are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law .    4.197066389074327
this is one such case and discussions are under way between the danish government and the commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter , to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who , as things stand , have a right to this pension .    4.448748620190944
briefly , just to follow on from that last point , i invite the commission to make it absolutely clear that the commission ' s objections , such as they are , would not in any way infringe the rights of danish nationals to benefit from this scheme , but simply that the commission has a concern , which it has the right to have under community law , to ensure that the scheme applies to all eu citizens who qualify .    4.967007025798786
i think that the answer is brief and clear .    3.0691296427085004
of course it is as you say .    3.553146921073821
there will be no problem with danish nationals within denmark , that is not where the problem lies .    3.821959234076363
the problem is with danish nationals or other nationals residing outside denmark .    2.818461611065174
question no 37 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.868164594930476
subject : working time directive can the commission say what action it proposes taking to ensure a level of protection , equivalent to that provided by the 1993 working time directive , for non - consultant hospital doctors , who were excluded from that directive and again from the proposal for a council amending directive ( com ( 98 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 98 - 98 / UNK ( UNK ) ?    3.4503856934013
a proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non - consultant hospital doctors .    3.7157433699473925
the content of the proposal concerns the average 48 - hour working week of doctors , with the possibility , following negotiation , of increasing it to 54 hours .    3.623186787346559
the council , commission and parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive .    3.866394563366587
parliament has proposed 4 years , the commission 7 and the council 13 .    4.741843258194944
this proposal is still being discussed by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure .    3.8888999165688984
question no 38 by ( h - 0805 / 99 ) :    2.4369586078737586
subject : measures to advance gender equality one of the working groups of commissioners announced by president prodi has as its objective the promotion of measures to advance gender equality ( gender mainstreaming ) .    3.496543949638971
which commissioners are members of this group ?    4.496200150412403
how many meetings of the group have been held to date ?    4.136715221657712
what concrete measures have been discussed ?    3.8431790834903805
this question covers several individual matters .    2.9467875456798
it refers to the special commission working group dealing with questions of equality .    3.4599039861694516
the commissioners taking part are president prodi , vice - president kinnock , mr reding and myself .    3.3834872675499867
three serious issues were discussed : the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women , of which i gave an initial evaluation , the second issue was the report by mr busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science , and the third involved mr kinnock , who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the community .    3.9015647327885605
thank you very much , commissioner , for your reply , although i regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet , since this matter is of the greatest importance .    3.596105173698446
we trusted this commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .    3.5282976112585667
i hope that , in the future , things will change and meetings will become frequent , because there are many issues which require the attention of the commission in order to speed up and conclude , as quickly as possible , those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women .    3.844814439203299
mrs avilés - perea , that was an UNK rather than a question .    3.816349439022763
but if the commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions .    3.111288108303204
allow me to say just one word . i agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least , once it did , important decisions were taken straight away .    3.639200135315823
question no 39 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8577392375892463
subject : community equal initiative on 13 october 1999 , the commission adopted the community ' s equal initiative , the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum - seekers .    3.750551522464495
what criteria will the commission use to approve or reject the member states ' programmes ?    4.210000918172819
which community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?    3.437793961282158
the european social fund contribution for the period 2000 - 2006 will total 2 UNK billion euro . as the equal initiative is a joint funding venture with the member states , what will greece ' s contribution amount to ?    3.8680049889229373
the equal initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people .    3.1438730352546607
its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace .    2.822191479086228
the decision on this initiative was taken in berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .    4.140672745443289
this is an important aspect of this initiative .    3.20611040781753
the community initiative programme in each member state must comply with the regulation . this is the same as the social fund regulation , i . e . equal comes under the social fund regulation .    4.456892699759899
it has been submitted to parliament and we expect parliament ' s opinion next month .    3.8516012593985005
i should like to stress that the equal initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed european strategy .    3.2814161860780597
the member states , i . e . the national governments , have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies , submitting proposals , selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control .    3.093841483082408
within the european commission , the directorate - general for employment is responsible for implementation , while financial control is the responsibility of the directorate - general for financial control , the anti - fraud office and the european court of auditors .    3.9482991897522184
the last question concerns the amount granted .    3.578230093751959
greece has been granted UNK 98 million . the contribution commitment is 80 % , rising to an 85 % contribution from the initiative for the island regions , especially the remote greek islands , and a contribution by greece of 15 % .    3.4648487047259158
mr president , i feel that the guidelines for the community equal initiative , especially the four actions described in it , will result both in complicated bureaucracy and , paradoxically , a non - transparent structure .    3.639913539714752
for example , one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity , as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines .    2.9097692501899077
at the same time , the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation , the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures , as these are the only structures which can meet such demands .    3.538909882916317
however , this UNK the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas . however , at the same time , participation by those actually discriminated against , such as asylum seekers , immigrants and so on , is UNK impossible or merely symbolic .    4.047518544955646
first let me say that it would be a great help to us , now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by parliament , if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account .    4.5666127251754
secondly , i have to say that the aim of the equal initiative is not to reduce unemployment , it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment , or to support an increase in employment .    4.313157626640348
that is the job of the european strategy for employment and the social fund , which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal , especially for countries like greece .    4.079441393074695
so what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups , between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences ; that is mainly what we are looking for , and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be UNK .    4.250763638281833
this is the philosophy behind the initiative ; the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies , non - governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible , so that it can get as close to the people as possible .    3.712779863834421
question no 40 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.85084016037444
could the commission please tell parliament the circumstances and the groups within article 13 ( teu ) likely to be effected by such an exemption ?    3.0044619451055343
a month ago , the commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment , as prescribed in the treaty , in order to implement article 13 .    5.152264775025895
the ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted .    3.5325597436561824
at the commission ' s proposal and after approximately two years of consultation with social agencies , member states and the european parliament , a number of exceptions have been made .    3.794551137424746
these exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification .    3.397371732334259
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this .    3.37856619351829
in a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .    4.13155006732664
that is the sort of exemption we are talking about .    2.899935104827767
clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow member states to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification .    3.9568384432124484
this is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination .    2.845107461395043
for instance , religious schools could quite properly say to a roman catholic for example : we do not want to employ you because you are a UNK man or because you are a UNK .    3.0911074263949962
here we have from the commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression .    3.6117323759444373
surely what we should be doing , and i hope you will agree , commissioner , is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability , and we should not enshrine such UNK and prejudice , no matter how sincerely held .    4.567591106839106
i must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason , be it the reason which you mentioned , sexual orientation , ethnic discrimination or any other reason .    3.4915461236424945
it allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .    3.504130731753931
in other words , it is positive discrimination .    3.986696105650996
in the example which you mentioned , it is only logical that the teacher in a catholic school should be catholic .    3.654117212195689
that is the only form of exemption which is acceptable .    2.9443139116642496
question no 41 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8561457824178327
subject : promoting jobs for women in severely less - favoured regions given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less - favoured regions , and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on , in terms of either finance , entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities , living as they do in rural districts where 80 % of the population is on the poverty line , what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment ?    3.243039700926123
does the commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real - life situation of these women , or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies ?    3.190963369878988
obviously , the cohesion policy exists for less - favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the structural funds , the social fund and the agricultural fund exist for the cohesion policy .    3.7311241202453655
i should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget .    3.4767138944119016
the aim of these regional policies , which , of course , are implemented under the jointly agreed european guidelines in each member state , i . e . each member state is responsible for implementing this programme , is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women .    3.821299864387627
i should point out that 70 % of funding for the period 2000 - 2006 , i . e . eur UNK billion , will go to the less - favoured regions of europe .    3.1419988932098493
with particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created , i would like to say , first , that there is , via the social fund , an entire equal opportunities pillar which the member states must implement , i . e . special policies for women which must use social fund resources .    4.296717666332396
secondly , the leader initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism , with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions .    3.522935755563896
commissioner , thank you for giving me a well - intentioned answer , which has been rigorous and well - argued .    3.5716070332671017
however , i can assure you that we do not , with the existing measures - which you have referred to - reach these severely less - favoured regions .    3.6333582989995885
they are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation , where almost none exists .    3.915936202513793
therefore , my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on UNK , which have brought results in cooperation , could be applied to those women in severely less - favoured regions , who have the odds UNK against them .    4.358994961035556
i am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to .    3.5587425832166506
i can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need .    3.762331525660276
with these forecasts of the structural policy - which i know very well - and the forecasts of leader and rural development , we will not promote , as we should , employment amongst women in the severely less - favoured regions .    4.4696956581869705
i would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying UNK policies .    3.024608937873934
question no 42 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8570975550974116
can the commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?    3.439125526758471
we estimate that the commission ' s new social action programme for the next five years will be ready at the end of this summer .    3.978598373083288
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it , we first need to complete our consultations with parliament , the social partners and non - governmental organisations .    4.159575078270518
these discussions have already started , but we will need to take account of the results in lisbon .    4.476652020193199
the lisbon european council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society , economic policy and reforms .    4.18259564128843
these results will be most important in shaping the commission ' s social programme .    4.027575608145094
i have already told the european parliament that a joint meeting will be held in april between parliament and the commission , after the lisbon conference , so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for 2000 - 2006 can finally be drafted .    4.329823936426485
clearly , any future social action programme should take account of developments , for example within information technology , and , in time , become a modern social action programme .    4.465293306543653
but can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter i raise in my question , namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the commission is planning , as well as for those initiatives which the commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry ?    4.296395175075241
we need to see which concrete alternatives the commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements .    3.6807071867735246
firstly , i agree with you entirely . account will be taken of the information society ; that was something which i too mentioned .    3.7122358273629428
social exclusion , the programme for women , the efforts we are making in the social protection area , everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society .    4.638633436846096
secondly , there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .    3.6411611059965505
where i cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which , as you know , is not included in the articles of the treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the treaty .    4.281252195720907
question no 44 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8571070825530462
subject : opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the eu under article 13 of the amsterdam treaty , it should be possible for all eu citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the union .    3.0548333262329486
however , for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance , freedom of movement is still highly restricted .    3.4931611463574326
what measures is the commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area ?    4.074262298740967
on 26 november 1999 , the european commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination .    4.184232657901549
as far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned , there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination , especially in the workplace .    3.59126683469346
the european commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and , in the end , to promote the freedom of movement of these persons .    4.821247283456972
of course , it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport , services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement .    3.6050681938889393
the european commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses , coaches and other vehicles , so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them .    2.8668989114854386
in addition , you should know that , on 4 june 1998 , the council approved the recommendation for a UNK - european type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs , the aim of which is to help them travel in all member states with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout europe .    4.15426231546471
i would thank the commissioner for her answer .    3.670929086616614
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe .    3.524833999500431
it is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from UNK to somewhere else in europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a UNK and also need to have a personal assistant or UNK with you in order to manage .    4.338831147189703
it is of course a prerequisite , however , that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability .    3.4724980611550547
it would be interesting to hear whether the commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have UNK , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them .    4.067109436495725
i referred to the directive which the commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport , so that people with special needs can use them .    3.8067625015924116
it has not yet been passed by the council ; it is at the consultation stage .    4.6182304435371435
i think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at european level .    3.513772216607162
i think it is exceptionally difficult for us to UNK in aid programmes for personal transport .    3.4602550443512627
that is dealt with either under special programmes in education , for young people , for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy .    3.67904740224334
subject : compliance with directive 96 / 71 / ec concerning the posting of workers the posting of workers directive has still not been implemented in denmark , even though the deadline has passed .    2.908938229948057
the draft legislation before the folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .    2.8251743705223498
pursuant to article 3 ( 8 ) of the directive , terms and conditions of employment must be in keeping with the ' collective agreements which have been concluded by the most representative employers ' and labour organisations at national level and which are applied throughout national territory ' .    3.5541540157745177
however , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .    3.1678848318999213
there are therefore two possible solutions : either the directive is inapplicable in denmark , or denmark is required by the directive to introduce universally applicable agreements .    3.1882396820651278
can the commission confirm that the directive concerning the posting of workers is inapplicable in denmark as far as ' collective agreements . declared universally applicable ' ( UNK . article 3 ( 1 ) are concerned , given that such universally applicable agreements do not exist under danish law ?    3.7284691917418042
if not , will it explain how the directive is to be complied with in this area ?    4.635738891344862
the european union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country .    3.1818204600139066
what it says it that one of two things may apply , i . e . either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector .    3.8633311185546377
because denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules , provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that , apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation , the hours in universally applicable collective agreements , concluded by the most representative organisations , also apply to posted workers .    3.4053348462695276
in other words , to put it simply , denmark has a choice : it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally UNK it .    3.2588826204957497
the deadline by which it had to answer the commission ' s questions expired on 6 december 1999 and we have not received a reply .    4.611701436072578
we are waiting to see what the next move will be .    3.3785349729999776
thank you for a very clear answer , the gist of which - if the interpretation is correct - is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements .    3.7438880362800715
it is a very clear answer , but it is also an answer , may i point out , which puts danish organisations , the danish government and the danish parliament in a very , very difficult situation politically , for it is a well - known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the danish model , which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements , and the continental model , which presupposes legislation .    4.5296209705181
the disagreement and the UNK to which you refer , commissioner , concern , first and foremost , another directive , namely the working time directive , but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further treaty infringement proceedings UNK because the danish government does not intend , or has expressly stated that it does not wish , to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements .    3.809359059181391
firstly , no attempt is being made to change the system in denmark or in any other country .    3.5014037449464426
as far as your question is concerned , this problem does not only apply to denmark . it is not only denmark which has matters pending .    3.9776959134696
five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage .    3.810105526704102
what now needs to be done , and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the commission and the danish government , and with other governments , is to find the best way forward , so that something which is decided at european level by all the member states , and which constitutes a general framework , can also include workers posted to denmark from other countries .    4.885037898502631
and this is the direction in which we expect the danish and the other nine governments to move .    4.454611858936297
thank you very much , commissioner , for your dedication .    2.6328085483014645
you have fulfilled your objective for today , which is to answer all the questions .    3.9798191993427845
we congratulate you .    3.823176074775615
since the time allocated to questions to the commission has elapsed , questions 46 to 68 will be replied to in writing .    2.6895199077383807
that concludes question time .    2.4246667551966974
( the sitting was suspended at 7 . 50 p . m . and resumed at 9 . 00 p . m . )    1.7567588635518552
1997 discharge    4.966367630295367
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0004 / 2000 ) by mrs van der laan , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on giving discharge to the commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the european communities for the 1997 financial year ( section i - parliament , ii - council , iii - commission , iv - court of justice and v - court of auditors ) [ sec ( 1998 ) 520 - c4 - UNK / 1998 , sec ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1998 , sec ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1999 ]    2.844509893953847
the commissioner , mrs schreyer , is not here yet , but i hope , and expect , that she will arrive in the next few minutes .    4.608415665516365
nevertheless , i recommend that we start , in the hope that the commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur ' s speech , from her office , if that is where she still is .    4.421433198770201
mr president , i am sure that mrs schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be UNK otherwise .    3.6401018916033654
i would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report , it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation .    3.5514763541832957
mr president , early last year , the 1997 discharge was postponed because this parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a UNK commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future .    3.4516121890530376
in its resolution , this parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious , far - reaching proposals for reform from the new european commission .    3.6240026413826016
this report , therefore , appears at a crucial time , on the eve of mr kinnock ' s reforms .    4.294476446868556
it is an excellent opportunity for this parliament to introduce far - reaching reforms to these plans .    3.4743262880668566
in the period leading up to this , it already appeared , on the basis of the initial drafts , that the commission had made very important pledges .    4.513340008846062
we asked for a whistle - UNK ' s regulation , and this is now in place .    4.903298496457761
parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated .    3.1543364769476754
this has now been done .    3.452009291774421
parliament requires a code of conduct for commissioners and cabinets .    2.8284826420917426
this is in place too .    3.416600280855039
parliament asked the commission to waive its excessive UNK .    4.019383231950916
it did this as well .    3.2126820012338673
the commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with parliament in terms of UNK 2000 .    3.492286841132401
fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices .    3.981330250659212
these are sound , first steps which illustrate that , if this parliament so wishes , changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly .    3.6801265134696863
we want more than that , however .    4.074122639153689
the commission should now produce an ambitious and far - reaching reform programme .    3.3715002173742334
this is not only necessary for proper public administration , it is a UNK sine qua non of regaining the trust of the european citizen .    4.082630268423958
we now demand from the european commission clear pledges concerning the following points .    3.928771716080712
firstly , parliament must have complete access to all commission documents .    3.441438826881065
this , however , presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents .    3.610879404124811
in the context of providing information , i would like to draw the commission ' s attention to the fact that we are very concerned about the present draft plans on public access to documents .    3.6728909741590376
if the current draft is correct , then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today .    3.9463381809965323
we must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not .    3.2199537766120936
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents .    3.137075976510079
we would also like a clear job description for each european official so that an official with UNK objections can more easily object to tasks which are UNK or unlawful .    3.18529338579882
furthermore , it should be the case that , if the court of auditors UNK a mistake not just one year but two years running , the management should be held responsible for it , and this will have an effect on chances of promotion .    3.839868588940112
ultimately , we also need to achieve better cooperation , of course , between the european court of auditors and its national UNK .    4.7207535936648375
this parliament has also asked the commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on 31 march of this year .    3.4036654415956504
it should no longer be the case that , although europe is an economic power , we have no political influence because , when the chips are down , we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it .    4.379470558145092
i would quote gaza as an example .    2.940167681576962
it is unacceptable that the commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it has been left UNK .    4.786718434978953
mr president , since 1996 , the discharge has acquired a heavy , political significance .    2.9172610648697064
it is one of the most powerful weapons parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care .    3.3049005269005565
this is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow .    2.700126483435087
however , we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place .    3.032669250413275
indeed , the 1999 discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the court of auditors have been cleared up .    3.291165616672155
finally , this discharge report is naturally addressed to the commission . but this does not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order .    3.521514639517691
as long as we have no status , we are not credible as a force for reforming the union . the reforms of the european institutions are necessary in order to be able to continue europe ' s development process .    5.081621229971911
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it is also open and democratic .    3.842083811755836
mr president , the committee on industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for 1997 although we were not specifically asked to do so .    3.3795173573138553
we went ahead because we felt we should start this parliament in the way in which we mean to go on , that is , by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers ' money in europe .    4.384164631353326
during the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget .    4.438616808136129
they were not unique to 1997 and two strands seem to run through them .    2.967230901273493
the first is a tendency for the commission to embark on very ambitious programmes , particularly in third countries , without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper UNK .    3.712660334515395
the second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .    4.340816836146398
i know that all the institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the commission and for some of the lack of resources .    4.707003901207042
that cannot excuse everything that we came across .    3.1946885092289903
citizens of europe expect the european institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so .    4.562429717040251
that is why i want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of europe by mr prodi and mr kinnock .    4.137811404722324
from what i have seen of the reform process , it looks good .    4.0911362905113275
i saw some of mr kinnock ' s papers today , i heard some of what he had to say .    3.5432834523544394
i have every confidence that if we and the politicians of europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .    3.820872260528909
but we need that reform process .    3.440089035116456
many of the general points raised in our committee ' s report have been covered in mrs van der laan ' s report .    3.528924678760512
it is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it .    3.537501787559386
it seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports , a series of details .    3.8130801834519876
it groups them together and that is very important .    4.642098488543955
there are two issues i would like to draw your attention to .    2.767965875357577
one is nuclear safety in eastern europe .    2.9700259810329226
we have to get this right .    3.0328713905194857
the committee of independent experts said the commission was not managing this properly .    3.0458569157355875
we have to remedy that .    3.187659494744485
the second point is about scrutiny mechanisms .    2.7359422330269103
we need from the commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .    3.9105876258331898
we need proper information , given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past .    3.8797144224233473
i hope colleagues in this house will support the grounds for discharge for 1997 and , at the same time , that the commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue .    4.035864262034542
only in this way can we create a new culture in the commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .    4.836029526672989
mr president , i am sure the commission will be relieved to hear that the 97 discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the 96 discharge which , as you are all so very well aware , led to the forced resignation of the santer commission .    3.3624862327577607
the socialist group will be voting to grant discharge .    3.337156488306532
i am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well .    2.810642664850516
but that is not to say that we are satisfied , and that everything in the garden is UNK .    4.884141130988877
it is clear that a radical overhaul of the commission is long overdue .    3.732564733173048
it indicates , however , that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction .    4.05185699787829
i just want to outline some of the issues that we , as socialists , have put down as amendments .    3.5721118577617434
we hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform .    4.463219816811936
we need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption .    2.9950755604639943
it is critical to note that the commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the court of auditors .    3.6552727986626197
the court ' s report is there for a reason , our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through .    4.314586434357225
i have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the commission .    3.5746509557551884
even if we hear nothing else , we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see .    4.126616229606864
too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them .    4.1396752216326025
we want to see that follow - through to a much greater extent in future .    3.438722216595647
we have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had .    4.996093310966548
we understand that we also have a responsibility here , that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential .    4.143895331893849
we have put down an amendment to that effect .    3.591012800738809
one issue which is referred to in the van der laan report is the whole question of the gaza hospital .    4.275442197776195
the situation there is totally unacceptable .    2.9299557523990694
we will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue .    3.747853762936132
i would like to congratulate UNK van der laan .    2.893763800780017
i do not usually bother congratulating people but i think she has produced a very UNK report and deserves our thanks .    3.51759460062093
mr president , commissioner , if we are honest , we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation .    2.9350002035318448
we are discussing last year ' s discharge , but also the commission ' s responsibility .    4.585868720633101
i would like to raise the problems which are still UNK up high on our UNK .    3.437674200553053
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed .    3.6567277184688103
it is about a commission which is no more .    3.7010982795807705
there is now a new commission .    3.248814364268685
then it is logical to grant discharge , because how can the current commissioner be UNK where 1997 is concerned ?    3.5729284214403885
the problems remain and this gives rise to doubts .    3.172209086903506
we have to take a decision now regarding the commission ' s good intentions , but there is still no structural outline for these good intentions .    3.685148081308803
we are all very much anticipating this , but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge .    3.583231963883846
it is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also UNK .    4.015131193826025
this dilemma UNK beyond the areas which i have already listed .    4.311725993778777
take , for example , the pledges made by the commission . they look good in themselves .    3.818680453201682
i have read a few documents written by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them .    3.390514145754885
but i will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome : the public nature and confidentiality of documents .    4.342010513457697
the previous speaker already said something about this .    3.7534083585688816
a document is circulating at the moment - not at a low level , but at a high level within the commission - which , instead of enhancing the public nature of documents , is having the opposite effect .    4.362001295345093
this is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results .    2.746984527394685
this also applies to whistle - blowers .    2.6985356373837903
mr kinnock has also devoted some fine - sounding phrases to this subject but , at the same time , it is entirely unclear , at this moment when we have to make a decision , what , for example , happens with whistle - blowers who want to get something off their UNK and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world - the press or parliament .    3.8634731100754665
we have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type .    3.2250344003223748
so there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made .    4.001125479135985
this also applies , for example , to the very real projects which the committee on industry has introduced .    4.575905048331175
in my opinion , the commission and mr kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management , but each commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general , empty proposals .    3.746033564660814
at the moment , our group still feels sympathy for , and patience with , the commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past , but this patience has a limit .    4.413633436489577
clear progress must be visible .    3.4277551457424145
at present , we trust that the commission will produce these sound proposals , but it is not a UNK conclusion that it will do so .    4.182759937726895
finally , mr president , the 1996 discharge was the beginning of the end of the last commission .    4.389869235215899
i express the hope that - in fact , i urge the present commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the commission . otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value .    4.890279841679977
in assessing the question of whether or not to grant the commission discharge , the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned , in this case in the course of 1997 .    4.215723206485708
in our group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .    3.6523233362864453
in that year , we voted against granting discharge .    3.5293816492023256
as a result , we shall vote against granting discharge for 1997 , too .    3.0812995564782955
we think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the court of auditors .    3.121667592114491
it is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised .    2.9288840183955136
so far , the promises which have been made are still , however , to be fulfilled , especially where transparency is concerned .    3.887204368550006
mr president , first of all , i have only positive comments to make on mrs van der laan ' s very expert work on this report .    3.0594404709152796
the union for a europe of nations group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 1997 .    2.62478340449135
the report on so - called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts .    3.424548756188568
we support these critical remarks , and i must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .    4.017304320610256
it has not been possible for the court of auditors to issue an auditor ' s statement to the effect that the arrangements covered by the accounts are lawful , and we should regard it as extremely problematic if we , as members of this parliament , were to vote in favour of accounts without having any guarantee of the legality of the arrangements concerned .    3.823624599578233
the majority have made their approval of the accounts conditional upon the new commission ' s implementing a series of reforms , so as to ensure that what we are familiar with from the previous commission ' s period of office is not repeated .    4.584179995665236
again , i must say that we are concerned here with an extremely unfortunate confusion of the old commission ' s accountability for 1997 and the new commission ' s accountability for the future .    4.076708588969558
we do not think that the new commission , under any circumstances , could incur liability for the past .    3.7048760370496865
we think it is wrong to talk about the commission ' s liability as an institution .    4.402691030858467
the mistakes up until 1999 are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time , and we still have no way of knowing whether the new commission can do any better .    4.076505677683583
by means of this extraordinary procedure , parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in 1997 UNK where it belongs , namely with the previous commission .    3.2109152168742203
it was the 1996 accounts which led to the downfall of the previous commission , and the 1997 accounts are just as UNK .    4.148905660739425
there is no reason why , against this background , we should agree to grant discharge .    3.2899914053595887
as far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned , we shall abstain from voting , and where , finally , the motion for a resolution is concerned , we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it .    3.765609851264696
mr president , the decision relating to discharge for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the erstwhile commission , to whom it was to be granted , had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a UNK capacity .    3.2789645409781127
mrs van der laan ' s report - on which she has UNK a great deal of hard work , and for which we are indebted to her - proposes that we should grant discharge to the commission for 1997 .    4.318645822317532
one might ask how it is that the current commission is to receive the discharge for its predecessor ' s budgetary management - mr UNK just mentioned this - particularly as the discharge for the previous year , 1996 , was denied .    3.768945822290804
that is just the way things are , however .    3.8115820521982777
in taking over the mandate , the new commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made .    4.257997430068402
this question ought to have been asked when the new commission was appointed .    4.011129135660915
if parliament votes in favour of the committee on budgetary control ' s proposal this week and grants discharge , then the commission must not take this to be a blank cheque .    4.815642652208294
for it is the third section of mrs van der laan ' s report that is the most important , to my mind , namely the motion for a resolution .    3.775388729285308
in the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years - that for 1998 is already under way - parliament will have to examine , as a matter of urgency , whether or not it was too quick to UNK premature praise on the commission for 1997 .    3.7366778197746027
we will be in a position to judge just as soon as the commission presents its reform programme .    3.2907172481340634
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis - à - vis the discharge authority .    3.0192570536983063
mr president , we all recall that parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new european commission regarding internal reform .    2.812041079635344
in response to this the commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures .    3.856579496744734
it is fair to say that the new president , mr prodi , and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this parliament .    3.638947081450506
however , the reform of the european commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run - up to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference and the reform of various eu policies and initiatives .    4.772262930658103
existing eu treaties will be amended so as to ensure , for example , that the enlargement process can succeed .    4.918612688664726
i have no doubt further reform of eu institutions will be analysed in this debate .    2.9241578398836987
but from the perspective of small member states it is important that , as the european commission is reformed , it must be done in a way that ensures that small member states continue to have representation on the commission .    4.315296269955053
mr president , the commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997 , but in reality it does not deserve it .    3.5696111451191523
1997 was a matter for the old commission and , therefore , the new commission does not think that it can accept liability .    5.543257162202559
it is true that implementation of the budget for 1997 fell within the old commission ' s remit . the new commission has , on the other hand , undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals , and i must admit that i am not impressed at all .    4.077678655398876
the old UNK which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one ' s friends unfortunately still exists .    3.291075575163149
there are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start . i do not , however , think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly .    4.158074651488844
i am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving echo .    2.917598813045327
i am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter .    3.3351039896015906
i am the rapporteur for echo on the committee on budgetary control , and i shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the commission will not give me the necessary information .    4.366970268953532
from the outside , it looks as if the commission has something to hide .    4.065211086339615
my investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case .    3.4321738134733604
the commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the commission .    2.9424113769681717
it was this practice which led to the commission ' s downfall .    3.965500708865599
i can therefore fully support the demand to give parliament UNK right of access to documents . otherwise , we cannot carry out our work .    3.3584107689774325
thank you , commissioner schreyer .    2.2989853818138406
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.5924185258399082
response to second report of committee of independent experts    4.7803876726960395
the next item is the report ( a5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mr van hulten , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on action to be taken on the second report of the committee of independent experts on reform of the commission .    2.5066741531631695
mr president , this time last year the european parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by mr UNK to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the european commission .    4.021934363771115
on 15 march the committee published its first report concluding that : " it is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility " .    3.384485874298297
the resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident parliament and a european commission UNK in allegations of scandal .    3.6028575999844774
since then the brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition ; a new , UNK parliament has been elected and a new commission confirmed in office .    3.6554904561497223
speaking in this house on 21 july president - designate prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the committee of independent experts on commission reform , which contains 90 detailed recommendations and which we are debating today .    3.5246415580464148
a code of conduct for commissioners and their private offices has been adopted .    2.826407242538703
in a symbolic but significant gesture commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax - free purchase of alcohol , tobacco , petrol and consumer goods .    2.7644653718153767
new rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials .    3.4661431379001453
the number of departments has been reduced .    3.649929269535404
the commission , in my opinion , has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated .    4.327602329512872
the overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong , honest european public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner ; an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels ; an administration that recognises and UNK merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential .    3.643218348287052
in order to achieve this , action is required in four areas .    3.276129183266432
first , financial management and control within the commission must be improved .    3.8814653586464747
the commission ' s dgs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .    3.4450136874072945
a new independent audit system service must be set up .    3.2139318940011394
dgs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities .    3.221581397785446
it is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time .    3.294174014139601
changes to the financial regulation will be required and parliament must have its say on those changes .    3.963548404874308
but while the commission must ensure that it respects the treaty and the financial regulation in the transitional phase , this must not be an excuse for inertia .    5.042701331810696
urgent change is required today .    3.880603656672638
second , the fight against fraud , mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened , firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive .    3.5369954461199495
this requires a clear example to be set by commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly , by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud .    3.6115277747337657
olaf , the commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent european public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts , criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the union by members and officials of the european institutions .    4.048272515306421
a proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , by the middle of this year .    4.37227339560838
third , standards in european public life must be upheld .    3.197013730095574
the political crisis which led to the downfall of the commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct .    3.8511990940381824
a number of codes have since been introduced .    3.262229977566723
the european institutions should follow the example of a number of countries , most notably the united kingdom , and institute a committee for standards in public life , with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the european institutions .    3.885593653035905
whistle - blowers who act in good faith must be protected .    3.2266702963343947
at the end of last year mr kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle - blowers .    3.0408872569373027
they must be implemented without delay .    3.0012745656452195
crucially , reforms must not be limited to the commission .    4.355455244456063
parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules , administrative procedures and management practices .    3.523173230134801
finally , the commission ' s human resource policy must be modernised .    3.568215486860388
the social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue .    2.990955196639693
a career with the european institutions must become more attractive .    5.057418982312613
too many young , new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years .    3.235101223890423
merit must be recognised and UNK , specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade .    3.984597977768132
the UNK procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .    3.3490713259902023
last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed .    2.7113315589787974
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions .    3.2521979115284063
it must be rid of some of its more outdated elements ; and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why european civil servants should be paid an UNK allowance indefinitely in a europe of open borders , or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of member states .    3.7343401648747925
commissioner kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .    3.4264674204524446
this communication must contain a clear timetable .    3.1815864006917622
with a new commission and a new parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be .    3.28086207818988
enlargement of the union is just a few years away .    4.746242047507323
now is the time for europe to put its own house in order ; to UNK in its institutions - as the independent experts might have said - a sense of responsibility .    3.8050701266170397
in june of last year europe ' s voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism .    3.724231695719447
mr president , i do not want to be UNK - i sincerely hope this does not happen - and i should therefore like to start by saying that i am , of course , in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate , necessary reforms .    4.007179548028768
this is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide - ranging analysis , but i shall restrict myself to raising only a few points , in order to make people more aware , if possible , of what we are talking about .    3.8255313709256065
i nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be UNK from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which , on some occasions , i have felt in the past and still feel to be self - destructive .    4.173095956056518
i believe - and i shall only pick up on a few ideas - that parliament alone , and no one else , can exert an influence over its members . if this were not the case , the european parliament ' s authority and representativeness would be seriously undermined in the coming years , and this institution would not move forward , as it should .    4.03626116472483
it is just as important for no - one to be able to or have to refuse the european parliament or its committees any documentation .    4.063713805210212
members of parliament must UNK the qualities of morality , discipline and discretion over delegated issues UNK , and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else .    3.659320897934721
i would point out that there is no european legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each member state .    3.7594419019756624
we run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .    3.9442433633535696
i agree that an investigation system should be introduced , but i am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and , in any case , the equal need for the right to a defence .    4.823376327272554
i am opposed to european community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat : whistle - blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium .    2.89228233292762
in conclusion , mr president , parliament must introduce a principle of democracy : we must implement reforms which allow parliament to grow and expand its powers , not go into reverse .    3.865822907103267
this debate on the van hulten report brings to a close one of the most UNK periods for the european institutions since their creation in 1957 .    4.414651835143482
the refusal of the european parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the 1996 budget ; the motion of UNK tabled in this house a year ago for differing reasons ; and the first report of the committee of independent experts on the reform of the commission which led to the mass resignation of the commission itself , are now part of european folklore .    4.036442117724266
those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the commission operated .    3.7348562886130843
remember that the council of ministers , absent again this evening from our debate , approved the 1997 discharge - not the 1996 - on the very day the commission itself UNK on 15 march .    3.7520572153434224
now we come to the second report of the committee of independent experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last september .    3.364099235370951
our greatest concern in the epp is to ensure that public confidence in the european commission is restored .    4.495913499470005
further steps to build a strong europe will be to no UNK if the european peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over - UNK officials .    4.364354651180625
under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months , which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency .    3.751796781293386
we are therefore concerned to see the UNK of commission announcements in recent weeks by commissioner kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a white paper shortly .    3.9235431288639866
while conveying a desire to proceed rapidly , it also gives the impression that the commission is in transmission rather than listening mode .    3.43157235268532
our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true - namely that the commission wants to limit severely the access of parliament to information .    3.7541164359265915
have the lessons not been learnt ?    3.313091774329188
the knowledge that the framework relations between the european parliament and the european commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee .    4.301804230176798
we could , in no way , agree with his view that it would be UNK for parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the commission to take up in its reform package .    4.255916643376481
the less precise , mr van hulten , we are in our resolutions , the more room it gives the commission and your former colleagues in the council to do what they like .    5.10559178669267
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the wise men ' s report should be implemented .    3.2902374996309516
we have , as the epp - UNK group , submitted all the recommendations of the wise men ' s report in committee and many of them have now been put into the report , entirely changing the nature of the van hulten report in committee .    4.097754376996403
we have UNK a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last september - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion .    3.904209586806854
looking to the future , we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the european commission .    5.534205142186845
we want in particular to see the hard - working and highly competent norm for commission officials acknowledged in the outside world - a reputation that has been UNK by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals .    3.8194832888089407
commissioner , you will be aware from your presence in the last commission why the crisis occurred .    3.9632965935966404
in a nutshell : there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available .    3.0318698070691066
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible .    5.484096884802847
our position was made very clear on this topic in the 2000 budget .    3.110226597763981
we will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions .    3.5301833645666982
but , equally , we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by commission president romano prodi prior to his nomination .    3.1640431785117977
let us hope that we can avoid institutional UNK by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of commission reform .    3.71430548258536
mr president , i must start by UNK that i cannot be nearly as dramatic as mr elles in my presentation .    3.398065828044949
can i first thank mr van hulten for this report .    2.900181096266977
it is an excellent report .    2.510121796160105
it would have been wrong for parliament to have put in UNK UNK every single recommendation that came from an external body because parliament should have its own opinion on these issues .    3.4770709282669587
it is right for us to have a focused report which is what mr van hulten has produced .    4.159455076867085
can i invite mr elles not to put the cart before the horse .    2.9018343717325163
yes , a lot of things were lost by the socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet , and may i warn him that may not be the case tomorrow .    3.8464743004781945
i should like to thank commissioner kinnock for all his efforts so far .    2.831475478659761
he has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change .    3.6299921638343426
central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .    4.746806203308249
it is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the commission .    3.6045024204540543
that is important .    2.607767873258657
we need to stop people passing the UNK from one to another .    3.2884919458645387
where failure is occurring within the commission we need to hold people responsible .    4.664018285039943
we need to be assured that consistent under - performance must lead to dismissal .    2.9744045521056943
this is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the commission .    4.0290819537757105
we cannot continue with a situation where incompetence , mismanagement and fraud are costing the european taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service .    3.194907990005649
i will give you one example of this .    2.576289163885527
in the 1998 court of auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to italian wine cost the taxpayers of europe UNK 8 to 10 million .    3.4157303504002114
it is clear that is not acceptable .    3.390511271590575
what happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation ?    3.036788350490252
we need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit .    3.817320913332644
we recognise that most of the officials within the commission are extremely hard - working .    4.32364669402737
but we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated .    3.571977913463697
we look forward to reading the full commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the commission because , unlike what mr elles has just said , the commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with parliament between now and 1 march .    3.601043839553595
we also need to recognise that people who live in UNK should not throw stones .    3.240472152295318
the european parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history .    2.9608457720639607
we have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves .    3.385277680564057
our own staff policy is outdated .    2.990256003747806
some of our working practices need radical reform .    3.205986529599098
i hope that the european parliament will be hanging onto the UNK of the commission in this reform process .    3.835703892586826
we recognise the proposals on activity - based budgeting .    3.399291037058701
we recognise that means discipline on the part of commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities .    3.9077499732468373
finally , can i say that the commission needs to work on its relationships with the public .    4.093152354686581
european taxpayers need to be re - assured .    4.1147314850318875
the fate of the commission , of the whole european union , rests on delivery of this reform .    5.126938080427821
that is the key issue , delivery of these proposals .    3.4125050051121484
mr president , i would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur , mr van hulten , on his first report .    2.7169105262857425
i very much admire him for keeping his UNK up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments .    3.19665968226004
i think that the report drawn up by the wise men has been useful and i think that it is also useful for this parliament - as already stated by mrs morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run .    4.021843995560183
we have submitted an amendment to this effect .    3.4236615500960905
from the many points made by mr van hulten in his report , i would like to highlight a few , not necessarily in order of importance but just UNK .    3.9593695853183752
firstly , i think that the commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents .    3.7932303378646877
the commission ' s records leave a great deal to be desired .    2.81824563968397
we noticed this when we had to investigate the UNK affair , which , as it happens , has still not been UNK out .    4.117960381038842
if parliament want to carry out proper inspections , these documents must be available , and i would like to know what the commission intends to do to improve this situation .    3.8382743839518407
i would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control .    2.304932865017039
this has also been partly dealt with in the van hulten report . i think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented .    3.5390179508663944
the general impression at present is that anything budget - related within europe is bad .    3.2356922512058004
it is clear that , over the past couple of years , we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure .    2.9369116260230017
is this possible ?    3.340954293782146
i would like to suggest to the commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out .    3.164051458805843
mr president , i would firstly like to thank mr van hulten .    2.461033150840366
it is his first report here in plenary .    3.2518037803037334
this is worth a compliment although i regret , of course , that he did not expound it in his own mother UNK .    3.545986440143673
it is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late .    3.213584129346037
in my opinion , this is mainly down to the UNK between the two major groups within our committee on budgetary control .    3.9651846880572688
let us be honest .    3.179612519557702
the second report of the wise men arrived in september .    2.6835679651368234
we are now four months down the line .    2.9442199439059493
meanwhile , mr van hulten has been inundated with amendments , more than 100 amendments in the first round .    4.23537850474988
my fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed , too extensive and too late .    3.638041200819283
moreover , i have been informed that the commission has approved a report - today of all days - on the reform of the commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our parliament , i hope .    4.398955845065439
might mr kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening ?    4.372963180691823
mr van hulten , my group of the greens and UNK will support the attempts in tomorrow afternoon ' s plenary meeting to UNK this report .    3.8188588548258644
after all , it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the committee of wise men word for word in your report .    3.0675607538571827
so tomorrow , if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs , this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more UNK .    4.532836706043315
in any case , it should be clear that my group , of course , fully backs the recommendations made by the committee of wise men .    3.7771598700329956
in any event , i look forward to the document which was approved by the commission today .    3.331944563077051
i also look forward to the white paper which will be available in february .    4.337400869828085
i have to inform you , commissioner , that both the report of the wise men and that of mr van hulten will become gauges for our group , gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the prodi commission or not .    4.337258296078362
i would like to end on the following point . just as the white paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated , we would request the same in connection with the new white paper on the reform of the commission .    3.5637297581529723
i think that there is a need for this , as public opinion is looking for change and , in any event , my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 2002 .    4.223264180520027
mr president , this report is positive but , actually , we need more than this .    3.9331693592664623
fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .    3.5149309216320983
they are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow .    3.367988391812282
this is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich member states contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer member states .    4.01169299717857
districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating .    3.4332771172895966
after each incident of improper use of this money , and certainly after fraud , the call for stricter control is more pronounced .    3.527183222166126
even the strictest control cannot solve this problem .    2.963302590404758
it will , at best , lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects .    3.369886578262877
it would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a european UNK .    2.8701002331454477
in the next couple of years , we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for member states or their UNK regions with a low income per capita of the population .    3.671945727260334
this is probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less UNK , more transparency and more democracy .    3.1581134995041635
mr president , a year has not yet passed , but it is already clear that parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently .    4.186240258985184
the first report was widely publicised , formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make UNK , first of the president of the commission , and then of the majority of the european commissioners , even though they had no connection with fraud , mismanagement or nepotism .    3.8472802984575947
reading now what happened then , not even a year ago , it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform , as is maintained today , so much so that this second report - which , on the other hand , could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases , since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report .    3.715809845060582
it is of no concern to the major groups in parliament , nor to the majority of the trade unions , who are busy discussing the defence of european public administration , but , in practice , are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members , putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use .    4.003845305130682
trade union representatives sit on the disciplinary board and the staff regulations committee , thereby making it impossible to remove UNK officials and preserving the staff regulations in their UNK state .    3.4795670658272897
incomprehensibly , trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition , and i would not be surprised if union members were already members of olaf , thereby placing this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee its impartiality , at great risk .    3.7579703646300024
i therefore understand why we are meeting at this time , which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates , discussions and the exchange of information .    4.120774451844567
mr president , when it comes to putting its own house in order , the european commission is in a catch - 22 situation .    3.9497343143434893
there is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous commission .    3.396355198838353
i sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this chamber sound , the more applause they receive .    4.010430848553097
there again , it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few UNK of the pen , and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to UNK UNK .    5.104375629945146
this may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the committee on budgetary control as regards this issue .    3.267895417208824
nevertheless , the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see , and i would expressly like to thank mr van hulten for the work he has done on this report .    3.460693143070881
provided this report is not watered - down yet again by the adoption of amendments , it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the commission on a number of crucial points .    5.210191586676636
allow me to start with the most important demand .    3.666312797690999
we do not want financial control to be abolished .    3.1095346366595527
the financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made , not in every case , but wherever uncertainties or risks arise .    3.464806258118361
the commission is sending out the wrong signals here , by UNK the directorate - general for financial control as the directorate - general for audits , for example .    3.1463173697480626
it may well be easy enough to change the commission ' s organisation UNK but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts , particularly those relating to budgetary discipline .    4.326328144262114
this cannot be ignored or evaded , certainly not on account of soft law , as was once suggested at a meeting of our committee .    3.623769890390908
irrespective of such legal considerations , it would be an unforgivable mistake , under the circumstances , to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the commission are , at long last , no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and UNK mechanisms .    3.9238572754766365
as we see it , there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future : a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller , concomitant and follow - up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up , and finally , there will be the targeted UNK - down of irregularities by olaf , the new anti - fraud office .    4.128961372628571
it is to be welcomed that mr van hulten ' s report makes the connection between all three areas and also makes it clear as to where the crucial shortcomings lie , which must be tackled .    3.4607773157824364
a few salient points : the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect , especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours , including those of a financial nature .    3.504183290466924
there is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned , and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the commission are rather vague .    4.344390839570834
i can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be UNK .    3.362885641259608
mr president , firstly i would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague , mr van hulten .    2.958703824970785
it is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and i am , i think , entitled to feel a little proud of him .    4.2567701528923365
i would in any case like to congratulate him on his report .    3.8726517812030408
mr president , the commission ' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy .    3.0138882554600235
the call to make a cultural u - turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one .    3.6311795356199057
i have witnessed from close up within the development committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80 % of the money is not spent . sometimes , an enormous reservoir of money is created , not because it is not desperately needed , not because there are no sound proposals , but because the whole system has UNK .    3.77154367874655
a lack of responsibility , too much ex ante , not enough ex post and , as a result , far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending .    3.7931737318691763
it would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result - oriented spending of this kind , with all the work organised on that basis .    3.6715623692058066
when the commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 march , i very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .    3.903080044516241
without any doubt , this will then be a service , mr president , to the european public and , by means of the results we produce , we will also regain and re - acquire something which we have UNK lost over the past couple of years .    5.156318681787684
this is the best support we can give to european democracy .    3.459931176849641
if , in this way , we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century , we are witnessing a very special moment indeed .    3.7392702815456427
mr president , first of all , congratulations to UNK van hulten for his first report .    2.554212557563641
it was a UNK of fire but we have a saying in the netherlands appropriate for this occasion : in at the deep end and you will swim in no time .    4.005167285614933
mr van hulten , i think you deserve a UNK for your efforts .    4.610689357955329
there are two points which , in my opinion , deserve special attention on the part of the eldr .    3.6223261320950972
firstly , there is the commissioners ' individual responsibility .    3.0358195609442413
this must be regulated during the igc .    3.484511172576411
however , we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the council and we have , therefore , submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the commission and parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall - back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the council .    4.4786949418696755
this will contribute hugely towards re - establishing the confidence of the european citizens in this institution .    3.625845516955327
we at the european parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own house in order as well .    3.7552925711774443
only when all european institutions are reformed will we have the open , democratic and decisive europe which our citizens now finally deserve .    3.9236849029524308
mr president , i also wish to congratulate mr van hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the house .    3.4913815886453436
i am sure that it will serve , amongst other things , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups .    3.4054804325321077
at this stage , there can be no delay in the process of reforming the commission , demanded by our citizens .    3.876087455291362
this parliament has often heard the desire to reform the commission expressed , even by its presidents .    3.6287112422421512
it now appears that this desire is more serious .    3.4853948598984212
after the resignation of a commission and after a committee of experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies , it makes sense that mr prodi should have promised , on 14 september , to present this parliament with a complete plan for reform by february .    3.3970770236221415
this parliament UNK awaits this complete reform programme .    2.923508006203001
the report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the committee of experts commissioned by this parliament .    3.7770461098135635
mr prodi said he would act anyway , that he preferred to get things right , but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting .    3.290266104137093
we want a strong commission , which can act in an independent and neutral manner , but with political sense .    3.8728006619818474
commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office .    3.960630571339689
therefore , the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies UNK to their parties .    4.081010045173383
perhaps the reference to the posts is UNK .    3.375005541982471
i do not know your exact view in this respect , mr kinnock , but it is clear that we want commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed .    3.608062337375361
we want a structure which allows every euro to be spent effectively , and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present .    3.7928547062957745
therefore , commissioner , we ask mr prodi to present us with a bold programme , and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat , but not with this parliament , which expects profound and daring changes .    4.024413454246917
mr president , the santer commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line .    2.585192398984423
therefore , the future of this new commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order .    3.4835568892695914
as far as this is concerned , a number of people have already referred to the fact that the commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow - up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis , with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future .    3.814388881870987
naturally , this is only to be welcomed .    4.802364914002355
what i do not understand is why this has to come at a price , as it were , that is , of having to UNK with independent - and i stress , independent - prior approval .    4.619641065683947
up until now , the commission ' s payments could only be made when the authorising officer signed the appropriate order and the financial controller gave his approval in the form of a visa .    3.6798121175013336
and so it is the " two key " principle that applies here .    4.00296265678003
a single key is to suffice in future .    3.0920317654548506
the financial controller is no longer to make advance checks , if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the commission .    3.538574636023193
if you will pardon me for saying so , mr kinnock , what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes .    3.8969471853907267
what we really need to focus on , however , is making the checks more effective .    3.434980414665604
this could be achieved by no longer insisting , in future , that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp .    3.6636532100831882
it is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all .    3.4522779545355946
therefore , in future , prior approval should take place in a targeted manner , that is , only in cases of uncertainty or risk .    3.8314505611819683
the officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis , that is , in the operational directorates - general , amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money , so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less UNK and time - consuming .    4.083620738554705
however , the financial controllers must work UNK .    3.3890360207498706
that is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the commission , when it talks in terms of decentralisation .    4.924027022298243
it is obviously the commission ' s intention to make the financial control officials subordinate to the individual directorates - general , but this is precisely what we do not want .    4.444769073346904
surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the leonardo affair , when the internal UNK in the relevant directorate - general issued warnings , but these were neither heeded nor passed on .    3.609895369841935
therefore , independence is prerequisite for effective checks .    2.9704415608967607
that is the position which a clear majority of the committee on budgetary control UNK to .    3.8614418715769627
i believe we should set the seal on this point at tomorrow ' s vote .    3.0730682843007164
mr president , a couple of years ago , the previous commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures .    3.3612960760504107
this led to strikes and smear campaigns by UNK trade unions , whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a UNK - UNK compromise .    3.1898346698245894
this was stupid of the old commission , and parliament was of no help on that occasion .    3.88196673420627
when i read mr van hulten ' s passage about personnel policy , i am afraid that parliament may again be failing to tackle the crucial issues and just UNK a lot of hot air .    3.507506540633952
there are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .    3.2513130270096062
where is the beef ?    2.5578648688567465
romano prodi promised a revolution .    3.4562262192753677
you have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself , but take care now that you do not UNK the crucial issues , the ones where it hurts !    3.474003865545219
sort out the UNK of staff UNK .    5.195366006162477
stand firm on the demand for mobility , not as a right , as it says here in the report , but as a management tool .    4.6897985544270755
ensure too , that training becomes a management tool .    3.689200037203586
do not listen to the report ' s demands that temporary staff should have their employment confirmed .    3.86586402849467
it is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis .    2.975554584861879
finally , mr president , as a member of the bureau until six months ago , i would urge you to address this issue in the bureau so that we here in parliament at least comply , in our own administration , with the demands we are making on others .    4.541595996645813
we have not done this so far , and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing .    3.8408852356592247
mr president , i want to thank mr van hulten for his report and to say that i voted for it .    3.1465681549054265
so i refer to the things i do not agree with .    3.904803195820053
i do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to parliament .    3.461537928960571
this report is about the commission .    3.902905474445426
parliament is a separate subject .    3.430857904664488
there is no need for us to bring parliament into the discussion on the commission .    3.613688510401082
in addition to that , there is the question of duty - free .    3.7685736959073606
that was a stick used to UNK the commission by the duty - free lobbies who UNK the fact that the commission abolished duty - free in airports .    3.912348224669296
it is not worthy of being brought into this report either .    3.3359195609473944
most of the report is about financial control .    4.396140270178206
that is reasonable because it comes from the budgetary control committee .    3.1785955275876603
after all , it is only 1 % of gdp , by comparison with national spending .    3.390372023426269
we have had all that before but some people in this parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the european union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the member states .    3.7320918507084557
we should get it into perspective .    3.2830888599013104
it is important to remember that .    2.8308144885443247
the business of the european commission is very little about spending money .    4.791711279165079
they have very little of it .    3.199886450333749
they have a much wider responsibility .    3.5205255463932197
that wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment , food safety , foreign trade , the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them .    4.041811632100246
i am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust .    4.0813229826841635
if there is , we have generated it in this house in the past year .    6.064954336263318
i have been here for 20 years and found absolute trust between the council , the commission and parliament .    3.7553623435995753
we have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic commission was UNK , UNK and feared by the citizens of the european union because they were UNK our affairs .    4.253434523347343
that is a gross UNK of what the difficulties were .    3.4789157825896746
this commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the commission that went before it .    4.091986645487232
while there were problems - and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement , for instance - we sometimes take the negative side too far .    4.3228701437184895
mr president , i should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report .    2.638820983521399
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work .    3.1881905955490586
the process of reform has been going on for some time , and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the commission .    3.784528531344696
the commission ' s administration simply does not function particularly well .    2.742708635748716
naturally , there are good , capable employees in the commission , and they are in the majority . but we need radical reform .    4.992487492276243
there is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy .    3.1882711844021445
people should have clearly - defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable .    3.9650543771809112
the financial regulation should be amended .    3.47932062782994
we agree that we should have better control of the finances .    3.7942964338248837
it is just a question of how .    3.6986024848334007
the commission and the committee of independent experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control .    3.3936342056742776
we should be careful about this .    3.0029153623947593
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control .    2.902431272456499
it is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent .    3.1541143267440765
this would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through .    2.8891427006911576
instead , we should be reforming and UNK control .    3.380249498776983
the commission does not have enough staff .    3.2400916331715206
as members of the european parliament , we must have the courage to explain to our governments and people back home that the commission ' s staff resources are not at all adequate for the tasks which have been assigned to it .    4.3062980855556745
and the commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs .    4.3461746745165275
the staffing system is too rigid .    3.4238293268979256
there should be a more frequent rotation of employees , especially at the top of the hierarchy .    3.1020915441301544
it should also be much easier to sack inefficient and UNK employees .    3.2017903422863054
i am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed .    3.778475040437758
after all , the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms .    3.4043706923003176
mr president , commissioners , first of all , i cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is , on the whole , a dutch - british - UNK debate where the speakers are concerned .    3.719932618130263
perhaps this is a little worrying .    3.9516386252937292
i hope , like so many others , that the state of emergency in relations between the commission and parliament is on the way to being resolved .    4.842618218427179
we must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner , only then to have to rush again to put out the next one . as mr UNK said , we must instead establish a system with clear roles .    3.9831125231706217
first of all , we need tough regulations , which can be implemented .    3.7293372633645325
there need to be tough rules stating , among other things , what may be decentralised , what may be UNK and what is independent .    4.198850371734431
i find it a little worrying that people are UNK for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision - making is to be exercised .    5.010498175165877
what we need , then , are basic administrative regulations for the eu , for its institutions and for the eu in its relations with the member states .    4.896997519502216
these are what are missing .    3.1678546567372163
we have asked for a public prosecutor ' s office and criminal law , but we also need administrative law for the eu .    4.012318885203947
we should make a good deal of progress if the commission were to adopt , as binding regulations , the ombudsman ' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice .    3.5427311234672043
the van hulten report is a step in the right direction , but it is not enough .    3.0436876058205713
secondly , we must also clarify our own auditing roles .    2.9539455838637494
the court of auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations , but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action .    3.6960558178306036
it is the european parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation .    4.691941415149291
we do not hunt down criminals . that is olaf ' s job .    3.4380194937273427
tell me what national parliament , for example , is handed all preliminary investigation documents .    3.3951833585897546
obstinate as i am , i also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the internet . otherwise , we shall not get anywhere in this fight .    4.435462262481045
mr president , i would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report .    2.9181093935633946
i am pleased that i can address him now in dutch , now that mr van UNK UNK has just done so . otherwise i probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .    3.425708696492765
i would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement , also with its amendments .    3.029485212723441
i am from the social committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic .    3.490181515664745
i think that this is also the case here , but i think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments .    3.6716291260799756
i would also point out that our coordinator on the budgetary control committee is mr UNK ruiz , who is spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a spanish perspective .    3.5516850026424867
mr president , one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is , to my mind , the rapporteur ' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration .    4.242543139892429
a very important proposal indeed .    3.5357120885178994
i am only very surprised that the socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by mrs morgan , because she wants to scrap it altogether .    3.8665135049088155
i cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale .    3.0441817480403883
on the one hand , we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but , at the same time , mrs morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well , as a result of which , in fact , the entire content of this report UNK .    3.858494382182344
i do not know whether this is to UNK mr kinnock , but i happen to know mr kinnock .    3.6823306795637416
he is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary .    3.459582671183691
in my opinion , such a far - reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary .    2.781180790170545
finally , the issue of officials .    3.883309869215456
actually , i do not entirely share mr haarder ' s view .    3.7347418443393186
first of all , the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised . secondly , all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being UNK , and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement .    4.166047053622774
for example , we are currently looking into taos . this is a key point but , at the same time , we want to abolish temporary staff at the commission .    3.7918298948636338
these two considerations are UNK opposed to each other , and i really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table .    3.782924980627133
mr president , ever since UNK ' s ' republic ' , the western world has regularly been tempted to replace government by the people with government by experts .    3.366056456945774
our parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the european commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine , themselves , what its future should be .    3.4417985941560842
in this second report , the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in parliament , which may have UNK to remove the european commission from office , since they shared the political UNK of some of its members .    4.293932651072783
the experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the commissioners from belonging to political groups .    3.5533204395841342
according to the experts , parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the european commission . this task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life , and this should be a standing committee , not elected , presumably made up of another group of experts .    4.022400793450503
in this , their second report , the experts tell us that italy is financed by the cohesion fund , that the erdf and the social fund represent two - thirds of the structural funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the structural funds come to the same thing . they tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the eaggf - guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the commission and to the member states .    4.351029242335069
this lesson in wisdom is 100 % ideology and 0 % knowledge .    2.950872275330347
this will not help us to reform the european institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions .    3.9987841599936003
the van hulten report started out as a UNK one and i would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what mr van hulten achieved .    3.8537512920802106
unfortunately , it was then changed , and changed for the worse , which turned it into a document which in fact , proposes something that we cannot accept .    3.9638194039446923
mr president , mr van hulten , your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising , arduous and complex , and i believe this is important in a first report .    3.5104635935053814
please therefore accept what i am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate , and i believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer .    4.419226891975484
this report seems to me to be redundant , long - winded , confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used .    2.95247064637115
perhaps ' redundant ' is the most serious UNK , and you are not responsible for this . it is the responsibility of this parliament .    5.536354086782422
that is to say , if this parliament UNK a committee of experts - and i am not going to repeat what mr UNK has said , but i agree with him to a large extent - to analyse a problem , where is the sense in UNK in the UNK tradition of criticising the critics and so on , ad infinitum .    4.280186954727063
clearly we are awaiting this reform from the commission , we are awaiting the proposals which the commission is going to make to us and this parliament will have to express its opinion on them .    5.708798979446215
meanwhile , we have to offer the commission a vote of confidence .    4.652784391470454
' long - winded ' .    3.6486672265932967
i am not going to mention the length of this report .    3.129507662455661
i do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly does .    4.325588862613426
i do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop .    3.6895510060160843
it is also ' confusing ' .    2.959479585644241
i am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning parliament .    3.455980875529875
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue , but not in this report .    4.511870315362665
and finally , mr president , frankly , i am not going to give examples , but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy .    3.979323276684276
therefore - in summary - i await , and many of us await , your report , commissioner kinnock , so that we can really express our opinion on it , which is the duty of this parliament .    4.405215746243527
mr president , the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are .    3.365856257314811
when one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .    4.000771871635646
hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by commissioners prodi and kinnock in plenary and in the committee on budgetary control .    3.166003993345481
the concept of transparency stands out in the report .    3.7234668420798744
securing this is a major priority .    5.1531035611498615
the importance of smooth - running , comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough .    3.1070471712292673
this is not just about bureaucratic reform , however ; rather , it is about showing good will towards the citizens .    3.6335393879624855
we must win back their faith in eu politics .    2.9034486150191405
the citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for eu provisions to be comprehensible to them .    3.6322661151365754
they want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served    4.16818242155311
whether or not the reforms succeed depends , to a very large extent , on the commission ' s own initiative .    4.066678203697423
however , it UNK me when i heard today that the commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with parliament on an informal basis .    3.824355388513417
however , mr kinnock , your presentation to the committee on budgetary control this coming tuesday must not just be a one - way street ; rather , as parliamentarians , we want , and must , play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when i find that yet another press conference has taken place this week , before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent committee on budgetary control .    3.690588082590822
i believe , mr kinnock , that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level , the commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations .    4.066061155665933
can i begin by stating for the record and for the UNK of mrs UNK that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the commission ' s - it was the decision of this parliament !    5.432565551839572
so if she has any UNK to offer they are best contained within this house .    3.0521856241415843
she knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this house , there has never been a single occasion on which i have refused to account in full , formally and in detail for everything i have done .    4.294713839371681
mr president , may i begin by paying tribute to the UNK and , from what i hear , the pains - accepting work of mr van hulten in preparing his report .    3.3080231983676707
although new to this house he is relatively old in some respects , certainly in his familiarity with the institutions as a former official - and i think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance , as several members have said , to all of our institutions .    4.152623155505599
i thank him and i wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative .    3.7102349083304853
mr president , as you will know , mr van hulten ' s report on the second report of the committee of independent experts is necessarily long and , since i want to make a comprehensive reply , particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control , i seek your UNK .    3.5294139756632625
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than is absolutely necessary .    4.529589222997131
when this house considered the second report of the committee of experts last september , i pledged on behalf of the incoming commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the commission ' s reform proposals .    4.168560512946688
our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the house when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the commission today , well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago .    3.418626963857182
i am sure that mr UNK ruiz is encouraged by that .    3.0212074162743945
the great majority of the paper ' s proposals are closely akin to those put by mr van hulten and that paper includes - i say to him and to mr staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform .    3.6725820975581493
there is nothing therefore that is open - ended or vague about the report which i have had the honour to compile .    3.2829381331161174
the considered view of this parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance .    3.921692213724384
i would say to mr elles that we are most definitely in listening mode .    3.4353142397263614
but he will appreciate - with his customary generosity i am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing , it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing .    4.619535174541647
hence the transmission .    3.1609654324501446
though time UNK me , mr president , from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the house , i readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas .    4.0405764721848145
turning to the main themes of the resolution i offer the following observations .    3.548652142177234
the need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also UNK what the commission does .    4.6765208270598775
this is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable , not just to this house , but more generally to the european public .    4.636497815706905
naturally , sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information , but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible .    3.6315570182876455
i have repeatedly emphasised that , indeed not just as a commissioner , but in 25 or 30 years of campaigning .    3.7299760642277655
that most certainly is the intention of the commission .    3.4455375611396715
financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform .    3.7855114864043946
as the house knows and has repeatedly said , the scale and scope of the union ' s financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures .    3.5395663009550993
several members have made that point again in the course of today ' s debate .    3.6487921226464595
we share the view , forcefully expressed by the committee of independent experts , and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures .    3.333204410141444
the means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the financial regulation in april .    4.328182025019929
parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital .    3.5547178720859276
i share the view expressed by mrs theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law .    3.7338965271268725
change in the law is fundamental .    3.894784009824358
there are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy , but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system .    4.083236491552048
essentially - and with legal change - the commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the financial controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that directors - general are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the european union budget .    3.7931682266623348
in addition , and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system , the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service - " the second key " as herr bösch said , established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the committee of experts .    3.787492881595941
that service will open on 1 may this year .    3.35141858736679
it will be headed by a UNK qualified member of the audit UNK and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation .    4.054024763986678
as budgets commissioner , here responsibilities already include relations with the court of auditors .    3.3339130144282443
this audit progress board will ensure effective and rigorous follow - up to internal audits .    3.2939997837660058
i want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them .    2.835480617190997
the proposed change will make the systems more effective , both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes .    4.283035314223417
i can also specifically assure the house that we are not going for what is sometimes called " a big UNK approach " .    3.691890532868016
financial control ' s ex ante visa for each spending department will only be UNK as and when the internal control system in a department is shown to be fully adequate .    3.652829373461341
i am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the committee of independent experts .    3.6676262792473335
that committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .    3.9529790479105196
it was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control .    3.492569542264783
in addition , i do not believe that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the court of auditors in 1997 .    3.2265832677025816
naturally the court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the financial regulation but it is useful to recall mr UNK ' s comments to this house last month . " the commission ' s internal control " he said " is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .    4.5876996797224106
for instance , the financial controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered .    3.4100365739941156
at the same time , the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies , notably the same financial controller , the UNK general and by some units operating directorates - general . "    3.4531378836993385
the centralised ex ante approval system was UNK originally designed to ensure UNK but , over the years , it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions .    3.586542335514794
i do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this .    2.8710208771477546
i take it from paragraph 10 that the underlying UNK of honourable members is that there should be a carefully managed transition .    3.437482790034606
before leaving this area i would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .    3.980446259121875
turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud , corruption , mismanagement and nepotism : the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by commission officials of perceived wrong - doing .    3.5650532562885444
as i made clear in the hearings last september and on other occasions , we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed .    4.1533797400080585
since june of last year , the olaf regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities .    2.988670817501066
we propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong - doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .    3.0607172579911497
the possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed .    3.545451502040419
we are seeking to implement best practice .    2.869011644847797
serious response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong - doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure .    2.9995075306285566
as a UNK , there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations .    4.812326687099654
a communication later this year will give full details .    3.22922319693915
i do not think parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose .    3.3779357225224036
i am persuaded , however , by the suggestion in paragraph 34 of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability .    3.851928578021795
we already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness , fairness , consistency and professionalism .    3.1164640092368354
and we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional disciplinary board - something else on which we will need the support and understanding of parliament .    4.101349234735337
a communication in june will set out the full proposal for change .    3.3857318501689195
standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the house .    4.160017976167861
with the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework .    3.5810397219661505
this will be taken a step further with a proposal in june for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life .    3.558925165765717
that is in line with the draft resolution .    3.35058717630635
an important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions .    3.7168051176479944
i welcome parliament ' s support for that .    3.567782437606073
we are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents , made in paragraph 50 of mr van hulten ' s report .    3.1789326980270065
the draft resolution rightly UNK the commission ' s accountability to this parliament .    3.845376661901493
president prodi and vice - president de palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the commission ' s practical commitment to that .    3.5792769410499954
i hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents .    3.4428607502195523
the point was very properly raised by mr elles and referred to by mrs thors .    3.291445313919193
i am sure they are aware that in mid - december we officially received the draft framework agreement with parliament .    3.08597389061144
we are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible .    2.636952052428448
the report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform .    3.217210687358982
i am glad to say to mr van hulten and mr haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment , training , appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals .    3.502296615141282
i also want to move towards a UNK career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions .    3.2964248561341316
it certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities .    3.0263885452760753
members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praised commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard - working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made .    3.9985687930726974
while the reform strategy white paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points , detail and precision are obviously essential .    3.1019280634813247
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months .    3.5044873123328717
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this house .    3.5744795888062413
it is , meanwhile , very obvious that we will need to work closely with parliament , as an institution , on central matters of common interest , notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations .    3.7354135326345874
on this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay , conditions , staff representation rights and so on , but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters .    3.2393890498243803
the early thoughts of parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome .    3.322529968859937
i conclude by referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the house relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change .    3.3149013022934737
that is most certainly relevant .    3.3031839937135534
we are sure that there will be an important " reform UNK " as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources .    3.7049852707861333
it is very clear , however , that parts of the commission services are already very stretched .    4.603095733003346
parliament has frequently made that point .    3.0339369294677616
secondly , it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology .    3.1936962895832566
thirdly , it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken .    3.548548313385336
they are already having implications for resource availability .    3.041566925180022
it is also clear that if we take on new tasks - which we will surely be asked to do by the council and parliament - we will have to identify so - called " negative priorities " and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity .    3.873898597643983
a central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority - setting into resource allocation under a system of activity - based management .    3.8140980031831018
i want to emphasise , however , that whilst internal discipline on priority - setting will certainly be introduced by the commission , it can only be fully effective if parliament and the council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the commission .    3.966648979155272
the commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of mr van hulten ' s report .    2.613250728928045
we look forward to working closely with this house on the UNK of the reform strategy package and then , most important of all , working together with this house on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities .    4.122151929863519
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.5924185258399082
( the sitting was closed at 11 . 15 p . m . )    1.9806614093186465
middle east peace process ( continuation )    3.4774394761145393
the next item is the continuation of the council and commission statements on the middle east peace process .    2.9298705516955468
i am very grateful to the president of the council for the statement this morning on the middle east at the beginning of this debate and for hearing some of minister gama ' s insights , as he arrived hot - foot from the region .    3.484802850065376
my only regret is that my own commitment to open the european reconstruction agency on monday meant that i could not take part myself in that trip to the middle east , even though , as i mentioned earlier in the day - which is another story - events UNK to UNK me at munich airport rather than transport me to UNK .    3.4586590776546706
such is life .    3.498414659146088
i hope that honourable members will excuse me if i am not able to stay to the end of the debate as i would , in all normal circumstances , wish to do .    3.9224437615703045
the debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis i had arranged to see visitors from the balkans this evening .    3.2727226287196474
so i hope i can count on the understanding of the house on this occasion .    3.663362559270219
it is not something , i assure you , which i would wish to make a practice of .    4.4832128886345926
like honourable members , i welcome the united states ' efforts that have UNK the syrian / israeli negotiations , despite the syrian decision that they needed more time before UNK the talks that were scheduled to start again today .    3.7840964507453565
there is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future . i also hope that progress in the syrian track will pave the way for an early resumption of lebanese / israeli talks which could then advance in parallel towards an overall deal on israel ' s relations with its northern neighbours .    3.2804711680262235
at the same time we must not lose sight of the palestinian track .    2.941551557028859
the situation of the palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict .    3.5527887336870947
a fair and , indeed , generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the middle east .    3.444617836595576
israelis and palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the sharm el - sheikh memorandum .    3.0192277890050683
although there has been some slippage , i trust that the remaining israeli UNK UNK will materialise soon .    3.362044424840966
similarly , despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the framework agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid - february deadline , i very much hope that the much more important september deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached .    3.47012745482945
i was reassured that this was also the view of prime minister barak and president arafat , when they met on monday .    3.6190547270352953
honourable members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track .    3.6900835284358564
this is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible , in close liaison with the us and russian co - UNK as well as the regional parties .    4.046218411150753
we are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development .    3.709669001603407
the beginning of the talks with syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in moscow at the end of the month .    3.6228836350785554
i look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again .    3.022644696870475
the european union has an important role to play in the peace process , as all sides - palestinians , israelis , their arab neighbours and the united states - have acknowledged .    3.3750167935762447
nor is our role confined to that of banker .    3.599790037989262
we must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region .    3.8149169944368526
but we should not kid ourselves : a comprehensive middle east peace deal comes with a UNK price tag .    3.5126994103610176
the commission is already considering the implications for the european union of the recent encouraging developments .    3.9845063501291342
we intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with parliament and council soon .    4.055513564242281
but let me remind honourable members that the european union is no UNK when it comes to financial support for the peace process .    4.163150258022924
we are the largest of all donors to the palestinians .    3.310906852279149
we have also offered very substantial support to jordan , lebanon , syria and egypt .    2.7104424809895167
with the israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them .    3.4538252765869513
the community contribution of over eur 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the west bank and gaza .    2.8345218712502196
european union member states together contributed another eur UNK million during that crucial period .    3.129557008438289
in this context , let me applaud the important steps that the palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency .    3.145163253024919
president arafat will be meeting the council of ministers next week .    3.6504581747123512
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .    3.7003224305295848
the commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between israelis and arabs .    2.8449828741667167
we committed more than eur 20 million for such projects last year .    3.387437167616525
this package included renewed assistance for people - to - people activities and cross - border cooperation where israelis and arabs meet on non - governmental and expert levels .    3.41963491283056
members will recall that the european union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the middle east .    3.7953167260323024
a number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them , helping to consolidate a golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the golan heights .    3.6100663918514626
syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a UNK to a peace economy .    4.055943298239206
reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern lebanon , the only middle eastern area with an ongoing military conflict , will also demand considerable efforts . we also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in lebanon as a whole .    3.8802326666279203
a solution is needed to the palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world , numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead .    3.8560140992583816
we must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region ' s very scarce water resources .    3.702861735671912
lastly , but maybe most importantly , we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas , bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems .    3.89349011695991
it is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the UNK of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace .    4.550603899360007
i want to underline that point .    2.936661965999197
i wish UNK to remind the council and , should it be necessary , parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing .    4.712763763971346
i repeat that a change in the politics of the middle east will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide . i hope i can add that we will want to provide that .    4.377926520908866
we have made progress in recent months and weeks , as mr gama mentioned earlier .    3.482266396705834
but it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and UNK on the way .    4.180945573610167
we will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome .    4.21550759977027
lastly , i will repeat for some who have entered the chamber in the last few minutes , what i said at the outset of my remarks : that i will not be able to stay until the end of the debate , largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the balkans for this evening .    4.269236896021486
i hope the house will understand that .    3.4773834424547476
mr president , commissioner patten has our understanding .    2.6343973130125677
i would like to tell him that communications with madrid are usually more fluid and , therefore , i hope to see him there soon .    3.371320771833912
the statements we have heard today on the middle east peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the UNK tour which minister gama - whose absence from this debate i also regret - has made of the region , accompanied by other council representatives .    3.813522383081566
the tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a UNK view of the situation .    4.408483011639983
i honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation .    4.515197334876339
in this sense , i share commissioner patten ' s positive attitude .    3.186663974886059
let me explain : it is true that the israeli government has delayed the third hand - over of west bank territory to the palestinian authorities .    3.1350908517119906
it is also true , however , that , since the signing of the sharm el - sheikh agreements , 39 % of the territory of the west bank has been handed over to the palestinian national authority , together with two thirds of the gaza strip and , more importantly , this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with , since , under the terms laid down in sharm el - sheikh , the israeli government has the right to delay that handover .    3.6036398638652503
this is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks , as prime minister barak has promised .    3.0509293859878635
on the other hand , the decision to delay the second round of talks , initiated in shepherdstown by the syrian arab republic , is undoubtedly significant , but i am convinced that the hopes which were raised on 3 january in that town will not be UNK .    3.123994754149057
mr president , the fact that the different groups in this parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution , in this ever controversial debate , which is the result of a broad consensus , seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes .    4.023877727222225
i would therefore like , equally firmly , to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences , which are still no doubt profound , between the parties .    3.824033648169248
in my judgement , this constitutes a guarantee to both sides , both from a political and a financial point of view , of the commitment they can expect from the european union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for .    4.715058123039315
it is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to UNK the serious social differences which exist .    4.745922049853095
but this also serves to make a claim , on the part of the european union , for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution - we do not have aspirations to be UNK - and which will be suitably visible to the public .    4.885100370943834
there is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the president of the european parliament to the region will contribute to this .    3.976681481604452
mr president , i want to thank commissioner patten for his detailed account .    2.579676644670277
i should like to say that i agree with the tone which galeote quecedo ' s speech set here .    2.9876276055481834
we in parliament strongly support the middle east peace process .    2.919379526671791
it is , of course , a peace process which is finally under way .    2.9618170344259087
if we think of how the process was looking a year ago , the difference between then and now is like that between night and day , despite difficulties and delays .    3.3401578477686438
first of all , the sharm el - sheikh agreement contains , as everyone knows , a concrete timetable for the implementation of israel ' s commitments . this applies both to the interim agreement and to the UNK and wye agreements .    3.5656332822234966
while the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun , i think it is important to keep the two processes apart .    3.694831169449255
a lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above - mentioned interim agreements .    4.261679055513335
what we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in gaza , the northern transit route between gaza and the west bank , further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments .    3.5946347580407068
the second point relates to syria .    2.6304176106486006
there , the border question is obviously central .    3.3035726228457745
how negotiations are proceeding there , we still do not know .    3.8016551228243007
what is important , however , is that they have begun .    5.250083797895313
an important question in this context is the future distribution of water .    3.5779651880260115
as things are at present , the golan heights account for between a third and a sixth of israel ' s water supply .    3.5106311821045173
the third aspect is the peace negotiations in syria which are closely linked to the issue of israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon .    3.4304079873309266
according to UNK , there are now concrete signs that israel is preparing to withdraw , which is something we welcome .    4.40450117698129
there too , of course , outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the lebanese palestinian refugees .    3.7234789745277523
my last point concerns the future palestinian state .    3.197975039193959
this may be proclaimed in the course of this year , with or without israel ' s support .    3.6508618485408406
the barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party .    3.909643375909048
even if negotiations are not completed by september of this year , there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date .    3.598834255393095
in this context , it is important for those of us who support the idea of a palestinian state that the latter should be as commissioner patten said , namely a state subject to public control , and that it should be a democratic state .    4.311122111457665
this is something to which we all want to contribute .    3.921474519302005
mr president , i would like to refer , firstly and above all , to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate . my group has made a contribution to this resolution and , needless to say , approves of it .    3.933681014715658
more specifically , however , i would like to express our delight at the fact that , after such a long time , israel and syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion .    3.7423936134518745
the recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the middle east .    2.977914840903062
it is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .    3.0841908513904386
indeed , both parties will need to make huge efforts .    3.9026329362186867
lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the israeli borders , as well as syria ' s integrity .    4.204709567625397
it is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue .    3.1348746956463227
in addition to the bilateral meetings with syria , i hope that israel will also enter into negotiations with lebanon within the foreseeable future and that , in the framework of economic and regional cooperation , a multilateral approach will appear possible .    3.905332080272958
nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the european union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .    4.4789500044326
this peace process in the middle east is one of the priorities of the european union ' s common foreign and security policy .    3.4179507114910432
this is where mr solana , the high representative to the council , could come into his own .    4.4041453983618055
the commission and member states also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region .    3.8519540804171655
i should also draw your attention to the significance of the barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation .    3.387220993335201
in this respect , we support UNK ' s participation , provided that it recognises human rights , UNK support for terrorists and fully supports the peace process .    3.68875156676545
there are still , needless to say , many UNK problems and UNK questions , also involving the palestinians .    3.3546078144584572
everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that , with the necessary trust , perseverance and indispensable political will , our common goal , namely a peaceful and prosperous middle east , will be achieved .    3.999765196611324
mr president , it is pleasing that , despite certain delays and problems , the peace negotiations are going on both between israel and palestine and between israel and syria .    3.3469756179843726
the moment of truth is approaching .    3.295732021174905
is israel prepared to comply with the un ' s resolutions and , in exchange for peace and security , hand back the arab areas which were UNK in 1967 ?    3.8829924489497794
will israel let palestinian refugees return or be given compensation ?    2.985948547882849
will israel share jerusalem and the water of the river jordan ?    3.1320066309700683
will a free palestine be a truly democratic state and , therefore , reliable as a partner in peace ?    3.6917523266753025
will syria fully accept israel ' s existence and introduce democracy and the rule of law ?    3.279844387383565
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country , israel , does not prevent the arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility .    3.4614722903123076
peace in the middle east concerns us all , however .    4.11429886135875
it is therefore good that the eu should act as a UNK to the palestinian state .    4.574341570944541
against this background , i want to conclude with a remarkable story from sweden where an international intergovernmental conference on hitler ' s UNK of the jews is being held , which is obviously a welcome initiative .    4.0700879582491245
of 47 states invited from all UNK of the world , not one of them , however , is an arab state included in the eu ' s barcelona process .    5.088268011768227
this has been interpreted as indicating that the arab attitude towards israel should be regarded by europeans as being similar to the nazis ' anti - semitism , which of course is completely incorrect .    2.9395601627762895
the arab world ' s criticism of israel has been founded upon the same sort of anti - UNK as , for example , algeria ' s fight for freedom against france .    3.595007617335337
but today , egypt , jordan and palestine have peace treaties with israel .    2.887599346321881
i therefore wonder whether commissioner patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one arab state to the holocaust conference in stockholm .    3.4015282422203628
mr president , i would like to thank commissioner patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the european union is taking on to bring it to completion .    3.451812346052542
it is high time there was peace in the middle east .    2.563492835337003
it is time to end the era which began with the UNK declaration in UNK and the arab - israeli war of UNK . it is time there were secure borders and political , social and economic rights in every country in this region , and that human rights were recognised and upheld in syria , palestine , israel and everywhere else .    4.150971877567848
this is an exercise in sovereignty , and in democracy for each population and every individual , but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights , and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given .    4.351299887618077
i refer principally to the palestine - israel question , but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the golan since 1967 and in southern lebanon since 1982 .    3.5480313736311495
israel has to accept its responsibilities , withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but , at the same time , it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area .    4.166061255663098
however , israel is not the only country concerned with security .    3.6789227691156374
the same goes for the other countries , especially for the palestinians , who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas b and c , despite the oslo agreement and subsequent agreements . between the period when the oslo agreement was signed and 17 october 1999 , UNK 000 UNK of land were confiscated , 8 UNK of which have been taken under mr barak ' s government .    3.3536872776065856
trees have been UNK , houses are still being UNK and , above all , water supplies have been reduced or refused , especially in east jerusalem , while the settlements continue and are growing constantly .    4.253250148711246
nevertheless , there is no doubt that with the election of the new government , positive steps have been taken : negotiations , at least , have resumed . but in the middle east , there can be no stable and lasting peace if the palestinians do not have their own state , if they cannot move freely within their own territory .    3.9117911906218232
all the international community has to do is implement resolutions UNK , 248 , UNK and UNK .    3.849334668860572
we feel it is extremely important for the european union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid .    3.9118426434399645
we cannot be content with a role UNK . we must be leading protagonists while staying off a UNK course with the united states , as minister gama said .    3.5094072429681353
mr president , firstly my thanks and appreciation to commissioner patten for his comments here today , particularly in relation to the role of the european union in the peace process , and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of " banker " for the entire operation .    4.075234788270589
i was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between israel and syria had been suspended .    3.147335792099419
i very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date .    3.818197461521819
nevertheless , we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the middle east of late .    3.5851802341374714
the fact that the syrian foreign minister and the israeli prime minister were recently sitting around the same table in america for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and UNK can be overcome .    3.2226173464052557
i know that if agreement can be reached between syria and israel , the israeli prime minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with syria in any future referendum .    2.9774956838121125
the UNK at the golan heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security .    3.9355154378379074
if syria would be willing to offer concessions on the security question then the prospects of a successful resolution to the israel / syria question might be promising .    3.1489209463497847
on the issue of palestine , i recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the wye agreement .    4.518610033813368
the key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of UNK , as well as the transfer of territories .    4.280606404175869
the low level of releases of palestinian prisoners and the fact that the israeli government appears to intend UNK implementation of building permits already granted , as well as not approving new ones , pose further obstacles .    3.299193633793578
these issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations , although , i believe , these talks will not be held up indefinitely .    3.9766189482763803
at present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the israeli government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security .    3.6890604925496637
currently , both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed .    3.600843424064824
i sincerely hope that , in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the middle east , all the key protagonists will move forward quickly , in the very near future , so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved .    4.277357965078882
mr president , the various motions for resolutions tabled in parliament more or less represent the situation in the middle east .    3.2030479947641703
there are those who are in favour of new agreements between israel and syria , but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the middle east issue .    4.280093662527826
indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .    3.194432601723694
the time has come for israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories , at last recognising once and for all the authority of palestine , whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of UNK arafat .    3.141894345182662
it is equally important not to lose sight of the iraq question , which no one UNK anymore , thereby UNK the problems of millions of women , elderly people and children , the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is UNK , to oblivion .    3.9982021568361854
i do not know what syria and israel will want or be able to do in reality , but i do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples ' lives as it does to the UNK of the cold , UNK , artificial UNK UNK in our UNK , which can UNK houses but not the world in the third millennium .    4.58508923161724
he was under the impression that the syrians thought that , in exchange for the golan heights , all they had to do was to fax the israelis a receipt .    3.414393962228514
oz ' s impression is also echoed in the israeli press .    3.2900886262588407
it contrasts prime minister barak ' s personal peace efforts and the distant attitude , even physical absence , of the strong man of UNK , president assad , at the negotiations in the united states .    3.9023238869131833
surely assad would be barak ' s ideal negotiating partner and not the foreign affairs minister .    3.256876750588939
and the israelis were certainly not impressed by the UNK behaviour of minister UNK al - UNK in shepherdstown .    3.4013044739138776
his behaviour towards prime minister ehud barak was plainly insulting .    2.904577811467839
but why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic UNK in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory ?    3.4178513533796777
well , the syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face .    2.8378503710495573
at the end of the day , israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the golan .    2.731616371657961
all the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater european involvement in the peace process .    3.1134586808540377
it is , however , very much in doubt whether brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the israeli and syrian authorities require from their peace UNK , the united states , not to mention the heavy , equally costly , security guarantees in case of an israeli withdrawal from the golan .    3.2986621575442667
i would like to finish off by asking the european council and commission a question .    3.2113464978656663
how accurate are the press reports which state that the portuguese presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the golan ?    3.627185763936711
mr president , the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between syria and israel is not good news , but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured 16 people .    2.8908063460126865
it is clear that , for once , the united states has not been able to secure progress on the UNK of these negotiations , and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome : the syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the golan heights and re - establish the borders which existed before 4 june 1967 , while the israelis wish , since they consider that it UNK their situation better , to have the borders which were set in UNK .    4.100081348393911
the suspension of the talks between syria and israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the middle east .    2.8600872390218717
the application of the framework agreement between the palestinian authorities and israel is also suspended at the moment .    3.5981527794546087
after the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the israeli prime minister and the leader of the palestinian authority , the israeli prime minister requested a delay of two months as from 13 february , the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the west bank and the gaza strip .    3.548381372007432
what can the european union do in these circumstances ?    4.306707842597666
unfortunately , very little .    3.432374320322422
it naturally has to support these negotiations , sponsored by the united states ; contacts have to be increased ; the presence of the european union envoy , ambassador moratinos , who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency , within the powers of the european union , is positive .    4.352819828131328
but none of this UNK the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence , because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the united states this weekend , we will have to remember that , for every 100 dollars spent on the peace process in the region , 60 are contributed by the european union .    4.175480181372042
when we consider that a conference will soon be held in moscow , it becomes clear that the european union ' s presence in this peace process is somewhat UNK .    4.074058778107626
i would like to insist to the portuguese presidency that we must play a greater role , that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the european union in this process .    4.146466567793385
i hope that the forthcoming visit by the president of the european parliament to the region , as well as the presidents of the relevant UNK delegations , will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the european union in this complicated and difficult peace process .    3.715245165208559
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner patten , i should like to thank you for your statements , especially commissioner patten , whose analysis i fully share and i shall not , therefore , repeat any of his ideas .    3.1169417094665643
i should just like to make three comments which commissioner patten will perhaps see as similar but which , for various reasons , a member can formulate more openly .    3.3791070829912773
but we have enough agreements now : oslo , wye UNK , sharm el - sheikh .    2.637964676549754
we have enough agreements ; they just need to be implemented .    3.497711724610733
however , in this regard i share mr salafranca ' s scepticism when he says that there has been bad news from israel this week , namely that the sharm el - sheikh memorandum cannot be implemented within the set timeframe .    3.179391443900909
my second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between syria and israel .    2.7566777992715443
i consider this to be very encouraging news .    3.383180749584824
but we have also learned this week that mr barak will not be travelling to washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued .    4.058199585153006
i should like to make it quite clear : if the golan heights are returned to syria , the problem in this region will be solved .    3.2790592638114893
on the question of the referendum which various members have referred to : we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations .    4.287335425259867
that would be a similar situation .    3.601718913276388
my third and last point concerns the role of the european union .    2.933826174350406
i should really like to stress the excellent role which mr moratinos ' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there , commissioner patten .    3.8074237487493323
you know that you will always have our support here in parliament , and that includes your proposal , and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it .    4.390710266434036
but we must also play a political role and mr moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own ; the presidency of the council must take action , the eu high representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves .    3.900404211995533
then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution .    3.3754503839219816
mr president , commissioner patten , the recent peace talks begun in the usa between israel and syria mark a turning point in the history of the middle east . it has taken fifty years to reach this point , which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations .    3.47105224860045
there will be no meeting today in shepherdstown but we must hope , as mr patten said just now , that this UNK of the negotiations due to syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the middle east .    4.076635931458354
this hope is contained in our motion for a resolution . we hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live UNK within safe and recognised borders .    3.431837684637912
all the foreign troops , including therefore the syrian forces , must withdraw from lebanon in accordance with resolution 520 of the united nations security council .    3.193516961081862
dare we hope for an israeli withdrawal from south lebanon by july 2000 , the date promised by ehud barak ?    3.065853526043121
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between israel and its neighbours to the north ?    3.364293540269084
we really hope and believe so .    3.3495010593055
never have the parties been so determined .    3.484449477782615
one fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from europe and which must exist between the people . there must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations .    4.169366572382634
following the attack in UNK on monday , we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism .    4.231608712170125
in terms of balance , or should i say imbalance , i must add that it is to be regretted that europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict .    4.1991909056717995
at UNK , mr gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by europe to the region .    4.180886661632705
despite everything , we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of washington .    4.826303830912202
like other arab countries before them , the syrians chose the americans to sponsor the negotiations .    3.195730126965424
this was the choice also made by israel where europe suffers from a partisan public image , and this is a fact , not a judgement .    3.7576984327068232
this is now the opportunity to reiterate to mr patten , mr solana and mr moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict .    3.9757881862237663
although it is difficult for europe to speak with one voice about the peace process , it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity .    4.0750691709823235
the next item is questions to the council ( b5 - 0040 / 99 ) and the commission ( b5 - 0041 / 99 ) , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on the 1999 annual debate on the area of freedom , security and justice ( article 39 of the teu ) .    3.1875754044020224
mr president , 1999 was the year of the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , of the communitisation of the schengen agreement and of the extraordinary tampere council .    3.5751342893357614
these have been the most important moments in the council ' s expression of its political will to establish an area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .    3.415099243426312
the council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens ' rights - and we UNK in this ; it has decided to implement article 13 of the treaty , combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia , and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence , as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the union .    3.6655447633981346
it has also reached a political agreement - and we congratulate them on this - on the initial proposals for civil cooperation .    3.6055786564160592
this has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a community framework .    3.5327576707097283
they have been put into the hands of a single commissioner , mr UNK vitorino , and we congratulate them on this as well .    4.184162403090529
furthermore , they have taken on the task of creating a " scoreboard " to verify the progress made in this area at community level , but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the member states .    4.052777707624036
we are pleased about this and we congratulate the council on these decisions , despite the fact that , for this house , the treaty of amsterdam included one disappointment : that of delaying , for five years , our role , our ability to participate actively , to democratically control this area of freedom , security and justice , as well as the role taken in it by the court of justice .    3.623329566652411
however , if , on UNK the progress made during 1999 , which is within the competence of this parliament in accordance with the treaty , we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out , the scene looks considerably darker , mr president .    4.147341031141644
it is as if the council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to , the other UNK .    3.4144523965953075
despite all the commitments made at the highest level , the council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged .    4.761051419786097
programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or , at least , this parliament is unable to do so .    3.7139401371384575
we have presented the council with a series of questions and i know that it is the will of the portuguese presidency to answer each and every one of them .    4.534252704602016
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the council towards this parliament .    3.769448068675129
i said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the council and the policies actually carried out .    4.117602927236747
there are doubts in my group and doubts also persist in this house , for example , about something which should be good news : the incorporation of the schengen agreement into the community framework .    3.5567801927422096
schengen has been incorporated , as we said earlier , into the acquis , but it has been done with very little transparency .    4.808741770397434
not a single piece of information , nor a single consultation , has been addressed to parliament during this process ; neither on the association of the united kingdom , nor on the incorporation of greece , nor on the negotiations with norway and iceland .    3.5450762136478837
we have UNK ourselves with a pile of reports , but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives ; they have disappeared .    3.931730744732829
we hope that 2000 will be the year for action , in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations .    4.190196124101567
we hope that the council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this parliament .    3.5759883514426485
the council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the union .    3.616591537109947
the council can act in accordance with parliament ' s decisions , or it can continue to miserably UNK its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project .    4.0977849318270785
if it UNK the second approach , it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom , security and justice is built .    4.183783311183015
alternatively , it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions , in order to move forward in another way .    4.790697780043039
fulfil your obligations to parliament in a generous spirit , thus preparing for the future .    3.662548362743881
provide the commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at community level and at the level of the member states , and we will be - and the council will be - able to deal with the decisions made at tampere and move towards a union which is freer , more just and more secure .    4.390326615239051
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , as i do not have a background as a member of the european parliament , you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague fernando gomes .    4.1213487077522055
as mrs terrón i cusí said in her speech , 1999 was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs - an expectation realised with the coming into force of the treaty of amsterdam , an expectation realised with the conclusions of the tampere council , and a fundamental expectation , as from this year , that will be realised in the form of specific actions .    3.5313451583958
we are all aware that , to this end , it is essential for the council to approve , as quickly as possible , the scoreboard which commissioner vitorino has the remit of establishing .    3.6429153360130626
i must stress once again the portuguese presidency ' s UNK desire for political agreement to be reached on the scoreboard at the informal council in lisbon on 3 and 4 march .    3.8128207861720997
turning to the specific questions that mrs terrón i cusí has put to us , i shall group them into three basic areas : the fight against organised crime , the operation of the judicial network , particularly as regards criminal matters , and questions on europol .    3.4410462808241635
regarding the fight against organised crime , 1999 marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the vienna action plan , which resulted in the signing of the charter of european professional associations , in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the member states for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering . and i must not forget the finnish presidency ' s proposal for a council decision which is being considered in the multi - disciplinary group .    3.620424707234032
this is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work , not just by securing approval for the eu strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium , but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the UNK of views that exists , particularly at council level , on issues concerning the fight against organised crime .    4.22040940753349
with this in mind i must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the french presidency , with the aim of organising a UNK UNK - ecofin council .    3.8191054262953745
if this is not to be a mere media event , it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee , the composition of which the portuguese presidency has already proposed .    4.720712727170668
our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime .    3.2224051078428997
here , in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the pre - accession pact , it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the european union and the russian federation , a plan which is now being finalised , and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the member states , in moscow , and to develop a set of further initiatives .    4.595426532538197
another area is eu involvement in the united nations convention against transnational organised crime and its various protocols , and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the council of europe , in particular on UNK crime .    4.602226110082787
as this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme , the presidency believes that it is worthwhile , bearing in mind the principles of chapter vi of the treaty , to explore suitable means of providing the european parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the united nations convention .    4.246246280854619
with regard to the judicial network , significant progress has been made , in particular the launch at the end of 1999 of the dedicated telecommunications system of the european judicial network , whilst the multi - disciplinary group has developed a series of actions to implement the 1997 action plan .    3.8938020404231475
however , we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium , so as to give a fresh impetus , while preserving continuity , to the work done under the previous action plan .    4.557531389995172
still on judicial cooperation , considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro , and the european parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance .    4.1941962302697915
we believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible , we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments , and we should accordingly make a combined effort in march to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects , including those UNK in initiatives already presented by france and those whose adoption the commission itself has called for .    3.975838742704189
it is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions , and we believe that on the basis of work already done , it will be possible , at least in the field of UNK of assets , for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions .    4.602264967683092
lastly then , europol , which started its work in 1999 . the council approved a set of instruments , with which parliament is familiar , to make europol ' s operations viable but , of course , the fundamental issues of democratic control and judicial control of europol still remain , and these are issues which have naturally taken on a new dimension in view of the political decision taken in tampere to reinforce europol ' s powers and , above all , to give it an operational dimension .    4.047038973065384
the french presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of europol .    2.8242871451592926
the portuguese presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the eurojust network , since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of europol to be a matter for eurojust , this option cannot be ruled out at present .    3.559093628663409
for this reason , it is essential that the council ' s debates on the future of europol and eurojust should be conducted in parallel , so that conclusions can be reached in parallel also .    3.7558303556428148
i believe that in this context , and in the context of the dialogue that the council and parliament will have to establish on the future of europol and eurojust , it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the council and parliament with regard to europol .    4.550582617279916
we are familiar with parliament ' s views and we know that parliament is aware of the views of the council ' s legal advisers .    4.720516757640343
i believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of europol , and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved .    4.318459072867052
mr president , members of the council , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , without wishing to compete with the ministers as regards emotions , i have to say that i am not moved , rather i am UNK to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time , and i just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the union !    4.1393578819477055
i would also like to thank mrs terrón i cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice , and to thank all the members who , in their various committees , have actively participated in preparing this annual debate . i would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society .    3.387439253141869
in this first speech , i would like to share with parliament the commission ' s view of the most important events in 1999 .    4.1754231026993445
i believe that i can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that 1999 was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the union on issues of freedom , security and justice .    3.2069284256975483
it has already been mentioned that the treaty of amsterdam came into force in may and this parliament stated that the most far - reaching innovation in this treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom , security and justice .    3.210041866854429
at the same time , it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms , and a logical and vital step in the development of the union , in the wake of the establishment of the internal market , the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy .    3.542897233864169
this project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common union .    4.3165498416676735
and it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the european union , recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base , with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access , on equal terms , and in which our citizens can have real confidence .    3.9661239427709463
the union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at tampere .    2.9577869898477935
i would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the european council , reaffirming the importance that the heads of state and government of the union attached to a fundamental project , together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality , following a progressive strategy , within a time - frame of five years , and that , above all , the three components of this area should be in balance : freedom , security and justice .    3.5554267896846024
1999 was also marked by the german presidency ' s initiative to draw up a european charter of fundamental rights .    3.672733405089078
i believe that at the present stage in the european union ' s development , it would be appropriate to bring together the fundamental rights in force at european union level in a charter , so as to make them as visible and accessible as possible to our citizens .    4.312978025579776
as i have already said on a number of occasions , i am in favour - the commission is in favour - of drawing up a charter which would reflect , on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process , the common constitutional traditions of the member states and the general principles of community law , rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator .    4.288354996622325
in my capacity as a representative of the commission , i will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of europe ' s common heritage .    4.3366211752055595
that is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged european union in the eyes of every european citizen , an enlarged europe based on respect for rights and freedoms , with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection , in other words , a union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies .    3.625187193751195
i must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999 - 2004 parliamentary term of the european parliament , that it was the year in which the new commission took up its duties and , as a consequence , the year in which a commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities .    4.579938156315484
in addition to these events , i would like to remind parliament of some items that were approved in 1999 .    3.7108209185488876
in the field of immigration , borders and asylum , the commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the eurodac database , and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into member states of the european union with a view to reuniting families , as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the european union .    3.6006756181524744
we also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the commission to open negotiations with iceland and norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the member states of the european union under the dublin convention to those two countries .    3.4364207821538835
the commission made an active contribution to the work of the high level group on asylum and migration , and ultimately , in december , it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a european refugee fund .    3.093020479037445
in the field of judicial cooperation , the commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the " communitisation " of certain conventions . these were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters ( brussels i ) , the convention on jurisdiction , recognition and enforcement of judgements in UNK matters ( brussels ii ) , and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and UNK documents in civil or commercial matters .    3.4217167022388786
in 1999 , we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the european union , which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at tampere . this communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime , in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation , including the cost of justice .    3.9843173636657
we also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non - cash means of payment .    3.502802790839823
in the field of european union legislation on combating financial crime , the commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering .    3.692975941434602
in 1999 , europol took up its duties and we in the commission , UNK the portuguese presidency ' s statement today , sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to europol under the treaty of amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between europol and the relevant judicial institutions , and in particular eurojust .    4.1459732404708145
in 1999 , the commission also presented its contribution towards a european action plan to combat drugs , which underpins the strategy approved by the helsinki european council .    3.400150080100314
this list of actions , which is not exhaustive , should , here today , in the presence of the council presidency and of the members of this house , help to make it clear that , while 1999 was a year of consolidation for eu action in this key area , it also - i very much hope - represented the start of a new phase , marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice .    4.088674142804979
for this reason , 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the eu ' s institutions respond to our citizens ' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement , with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection .    3.5125375768817704
in other words , 2000 will be a test of the political will to take amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political union for the next decade - a test for the council , for parliament and for the commission .    4.231337961146893
as i have already said , the commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the treaty of amsterdam , in the vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the tampere european council .    4.161980300540697
this scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning . it will also , and above all , be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the european union ' s institutions towards the public .    4.171448728228667
it is for the public , therefore , that we are developing the area of freedom , security and justice .    3.3537505512163746
the progress made will not be due to the commission nor to the council , nor even to the european parliament , but to a combination of european institutions and to the member states themselves , in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the member states under the principle of subsidiarity .    4.997784745079049
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project .    4.290677223150556
and we hope , during the portuguese presidency , to present the final version to the justice and home affairs council , taking account of the UNK that i have just mentioned .    4.405265362593571
for this reason , and i believe that this is a challenge we are all facing , i recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship , for legality and , ultimately , for democracy itself .    4.0555732746034066
in addition to the scoreboard , i would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the commission intends to present during 2000 - and i would like to emphasise that i am delighted the portuguese presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom , security and justice as a priority in its work programme .    3.9339102656594327
i hope that in conjunction with the portuguese presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , which is also the political message of tampere , and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies .    4.1001471993472824
i also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the high level group on asylum and migration , and to make progress in adapting community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses .    3.791667677675261
furthermore , on the subject of crossing the external borders of member states , which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons , i shall , in the next few days , be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders .    4.072736125130606
turning to judicial cooperation , in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non - contractual obligations , i sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross - border proceedings .    3.8665658784393098
we will be organising and supporting actions including , in particular , the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters .    3.5692971683956736
the commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention , so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area , and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency ; we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the community for this purpose .    4.035646751971128
the commission will also support the presidency ' s efforts to clarify the judicial framework and the framework for police and judicial administrative cooperation in the fight against money laundering , an eminently cross - pillar issue .    3.477958364363816
the commission will fulfil the remit given to it at tampere to present proposals for approving definitions , criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings , economic exploitation of immigrants , and sexual exploitation of woman and children , with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication , notably the internet , for distributing child pornography .    3.243270616452972
the year 2000 also marks the start of the implementation of the european union drugs strategy 2000 - 2004 .    4.3530159543330695
in this field the commission , in conjunction with the portuguese presidency and the european parliament , will give its full support to the interinstitutional conference to be held on drugs in february .    4.220303499678
with regard to schengen , without wishing to UNK on the territory of the council , or more precisely the incorporation of the schengen acquis into the community framework , i would like to stress , on the topical subject of restoring border controls , that the commission wishes to reiterate its willingness to ensure greater control of the application of article 2 ( 2 ) of the schengen convention in order to reinforce its authority .    4.3124708681277495
the recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on article 62 of the treaty .    3.6876078343687433
as was emphasised at tampere , and as part of our preparations for the feira european council in june 2000 , we will have to prepare a summary of the implications of the new external dimension of justice and home affairs with a view to adopting cross - pillar policy strategies , which strengthen the links between the union ' s internal and external policies in this field and help to uphold the union ' s position on the world stage .    4.400263742827587
nevertheless , i must make it clear that all these actions will , of course , have to take into account the principles agreed at the helsinki european council concerning applicant countries , so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom , security and justice .    3.4905669309888476
furthermore , it is important to remember that 2000 will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and i anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at helsinki .    3.623749979735878
lastly , i would like to state once again that the commission intends to be in the UNK position in presenting proposals for implementing the treaty of amsterdam .    3.6659206365892225
i hope that the commission and the council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself . as i have told parliament , the task before us is immense and ambitious , and the commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge .    4.213381501926448
we hope that we can count on the support of parliament , and - why not say it - of the council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives , so that the establishment of an area of freedom , security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible , thus allowing us all to contribute , in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation , to the realisation of this project , which is , without a doubt , the " UNK in the crown " of the treaty of amsterdam .    4.368051160911579
mr president , having devoted itself over the last 40 years to establishing a common internal market , the house now faces the major new task of creating an area of freedom , security and justice , a task which we will only be able to master successfully if all the institutions of the union work together towards this ambitious goal with mutual respect and consideration for each other ' s competence .    3.4268724604619134
commissioner vitorino , although i would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable , words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the council has demonstrated towards us .    3.9044890037651885
it looked , as mr schulz once aptly said in committee , as if the council understood the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the council has free UNK , security from parliament and the right to do and order as it will .    4.163951313868879
i should like to raise three points which for us , as members of the ppe group , must be focal points when such an area is created .    4.057417335796219
first : a common asylum law must be created and the burden of UNK refugees must be distributed .    3.5201421509257846
the council must start by at long last ensuring that eurodac is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for UNK asylum seekers .    3.6076642915154347
as far as a european asylum law is concerned , a start was in fact made at vienna and tampere .    3.6018242910910656
unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .    3.85618522537929
i therefore call on the council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole union .    3.9369566250253367
similarly , it cannot be right for just a few member states willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .    3.5865116961787478
agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda .    3.4514921745408373
secondly : the introduction of a europe - wide fight against organised crime , including by europol and eurojust .    3.3403234725918587
the planned introduction of eurojust is one of our significant successes from tampere and must now be implemented UNK .    3.684811852384192
we welcome the fact that europol has finally been able to start work .    3.6718185142334834
however , the council should also bear in mind that , if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen europol ' s remit , as decided at tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities .    3.7337383531251187
we are not just calling for more control , and more control over europol ; our UNK here is " less is sometimes more ! "    3.3249839292251284
with most of europol employees currently engaged in self - control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments , we may have a great deal of control , but it is inefficient control .    3.6338559522986507
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the european parliament , without hampering the work of europol .    3.814127375495815
at the same time , we support the establishment of a european police UNK as suggested in tampere as a step in the right direction .    2.7553327112738972
thirdly : the extension to parliament ' s rights in this context .    4.486427364767448
if the establishment of such an area , in which the union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens , is only decided by UNK and bureaucrats , while the elected representatives of europe are reduced to following developments like a UNK watching a snake , then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens .    4.247103508396893
there is therefore an urgent need to grant parliament codecision rights in this respect and , as we have already said , to strengthen the principle of democratic control .    5.409449950640504
we want an area of freedom , security and justice for the citizens of europe , not against them .    3.0896720503043906
i was also encouraged by commissioner patten ' s comments this morning about a rapid reaction fund for security crises .    3.4023251631985088
perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in kosovo the police they promised .    3.338601429663853
the first is asylum .    2.8714348468566646
it is essential to establish a single european system , but one based on fairness , full respect for the geneva convention and decent reception conditions , including an end to routine detention .    3.812060336326883
decisions on asylum should take months - not years .    3.371585503308242
the second area is that of freedom : freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the union ; freedom of information ; freedom to vote for all who have european citizenship - and that includes not just member state citizens but third country nationals .    3.68500625752391
let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom , not just about repression .    3.949103374502023
the last area i want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems .    3.6054329887019665
eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty , the end of the nation - state , and so on . but the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in france , including british student , isabel peake , who was thrown off a train , shows why we need mutual recognition .    3.80454243091492
arrested and released in madrid , he is now being UNK after arrest in lisbon .    3.711536565070215
whatever the eurosceptics say , it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters .    3.9912336014285414
finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and i hope that the igc will cover this , to move to codecision with the european parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .    4.585420200082706
mr president , all i can say about 1999 is this : how wonderful to feel the portuguese summer after the finnish winter .    3.17608455895161
the tampere summit was certainly an important milestone in 1999 for europe , and for the area of freedom , security and justice in particular .    3.2601173713921767
numerous questions are still outstanding .    3.271396766912055
answers are still awaited .    3.886853474195812
since tampere , there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent .    3.571091692406505
regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .    3.8291519226104853
on the other hand , quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life .    3.2480566483453637
the creation of a charter of fundamental rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future .    3.83065581957901
however , it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the union .    4.15850531195445
the europol agreement has now officially entered into force .    3.3795014871547413
in tampere , the question of granting operational powers was discussed .    3.9361137561505184
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control .    4.250256880487961
the agreement also attracts criticism with regard to eurodac .    3.4257007801545503
parliament has amended the contractual text .    2.9984222771312674
care must be taken to ensure that the council complies with parliament ' s modus operandi .    4.894354964170475
unfortunately , no initiatives have yet UNK regarding other matters and we still await them .    3.2933788513053686
europe as an area of freedom , security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors .    3.1237783820922083
and yet we owe this to the citizens of europe .    3.182378300706825
having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers , i am optimistic and i am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months .    4.597965578015066
mr president , commissioner , the oral question tabled by mrs terrón i cusí shows that this house is taking a firm stance . indeed , six months after the election of this new parliament , we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of europe .    4.065125150412761
i believe that the portuguese presidency can contribute positively to this .    3.3944177580956802
we are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom , security and justice , particularly social justice .    3.382683914413041
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their UNK for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems .    3.6976496220748047
this is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres .    2.707630329723123
for europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity , we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged .    4.595625424376278
a proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism , xenophobia , nationalism and extreme - right racist movements .    3.475023950627422
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees .    3.312082181987475
the virtually systematic conditions of detention and the UNK of asylum - seekers are no longer acceptable .    4.107134049852631
all asylum - seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with UNK effect .    3.1223251891744703
last week , and somewhat by chance , i witnessed , at UNK airport , a scene of rare violence in which two young women , admittedly illegal immigrants , were being returned to UNK .    3.058804334566327
they were treated like the worst criminals .    3.1920161406917265
they were stripped UNK and dragged along the floor by their hair , UNK by a UNK of state security police .    3.6835081191732026
the portuguese presidency must put an end to this type of UNK behaviour .    3.4337002823761793
our role should be to accompany , reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships .    3.485317592516407
the commission has proposed creating a european fund for refugees to which parliament was favourably disposed .    3.124231208115408
instead of all this UNK about the budget granted to this fund , we could take the decision to set this up .    4.335707719047406
the presidency and the council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in tampere , even though this summit provided an important basis .    3.6195118433128823
likewise , we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide - ranging action .    3.653120447325034
the laws against racism must be harmonised .    3.2571291029723737
what direction do you intend to give to article 13 of the ec treaty ?    3.7824935070369925
what do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women ?    3.8345983833103046
how do you aim to eradicate UNK , racism and UNK ?    3.098956021206326
we must take the best from each of our countries .    3.572262178723396
when six european countries have granted the right to vote , the president of this house can venture to extend this right to vote , and eligibility to participate in the municipal and european elections , to all people from outside the community who have lived in europe for more than five years .    3.9132636708763244
the UNK of illegal immigrants in certain countries , including your own , must act as an example to others . these illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of UNK UNK , an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation , UNK them modern - day slaves .    3.3527653179266705
in more general terms , this presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants .    3.673827544403453
immigration is too often a UNK for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses .    3.6192661147177394
how do you intend to make our people understand that , today like always , immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is , and will remain , essential in the context of population ?    3.9722481255667796
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum - seekers ?    3.918598975215556
mr president , there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security , freedom and justice .    3.060619106055927
the level of racism in our society is terrifying .    3.885213824272494
ireland , for generations , sent her sons and UNK to places of safety throughout the world , but now when the celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations , we are showing a very ugly side to our character . racism in ireland is endemic .    3.389968782895281
it has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the european union for a long time .    3.9173222555917424
we are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up .    3.926157351231597
there is a willingness but fear pervades , and to UNK this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in ireland but throughout the european union .    3.717346238795457
mr president , we take note that the excuse - making , reticent presidency , which , in recent months , has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today , has come to an end .    4.098602386820464
i totally agree with mr von UNK and mr schulz ' s remarks , and truly believe that the european parliament and the court of justice need to be more involved in the area of freedom , security and justice , without having to UNK from their own powers .    4.2693527400567985
nevertheless , to avoid the customary UNK , which every six months has us UNK attacking the presidency of the council , maybe parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next intergovernmental conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years .    3.5396168704057036
the two identical - sounding questions which are under discussion are , of course , underpinned by a mantra of the kind which , in recent years , has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology - fine - sounding , but pernicious .    3.442033593278093
and our current eu mantra is afsj : area for freedom , security and justice .    2.6795581307650806
behind this lies another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house , namely to introduce such an area .    5.251254610652786
and who is not in favour of security , freedom and justice ?    4.997937766129417
the problem is just that this is not something the eu can introduce by means of legislative UNK and other supranational resolutions .    3.9307381924073703
freedom , security and justice are the root system of any society , reflecting its history , corporate experience and political development .    3.2752074771899458
a system of this kind is not something the eu can introduce without society ' s sustaining damage as a result .    3.35253313987702
but it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security , freedom and justice .    2.839972765541416
the agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen .    3.0866100572924267
that is already secured by means of the various national legal systems .    3.9371601806137972
the agenda is designed to transfer vital parts of society ' s criminal law , policy on crime and administration of justice to the eu ' s control .    3.664808793444562
it is concerned with increased integration which , as part of a UNK package , involves increased repression and control .    3.9362146195028425
you just have to think of all the resolutions concerning UNK UNK , schengen , eurodac etc . any democrat can spot two key problems .    3.758594379396674
first of all , the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic .    3.4688010809328094
how is it envisaged that the eu ' s institutions , which are already stretched well beyond their capacity , can bring the ambitious projects concerned to fruition ?    3.647539959655111
think of last year ' s UNK criticism of the commission ' s lack of UNK , ethics and accountability .    5.117907884535686
it also , of course , finds indirect expression in the question .    3.253776963447649
but , secondly , the projects will put a UNK on , indeed will be UNK to , the national democracies .    4.74540188939444
as long as the eu UNK around the internal market , only the body was being attacked . now , it is the soul .    4.046279519300771
mr president , today the people of northern ireland see a strange UNK .    3.0458813089922177
we had commissioner patten speaking in this house in defence of freedom , security and justice and yet his report before the british house of commons this afternoon , which has been accepted , will do away with the royal UNK UNK and its reserves and put the people of northern ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists .    3.6177990140426632
the UNK terrorists have not given up any of their weapons , nor have the UNK terrorists , yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community .    4.033950723240277
let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed .    3.6430156173439188
in 1998 , we had 55 murders .    3.449520173131561
in 1999 , we had 7 murders and that does not include the UNK bomb where 29 were killed and 300 injured .    3.3222149441413555
between 1998 and 1999 , loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people , while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people .    2.875166876453305
charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled UNK , while those against republicans totalled 97 .    3.1084575247665653
since january 2000 , there have been six UNK by loyalists and two by republicans , loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults , one leading to another murder , while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults .    3.167226663515531
mr president , that situation cannot continue and needs UNK .    3.184341337744405
mr president , the treaty of amsterdam has set an important objective for the union .    3.390841579311445
this is a task which all meps , the council and the commission must take on during this legislature : the creation , as has been said already , of an area of freedom , security and justice .    3.1370231381501976
the tampere council , the motor and UNK of this objective , has proposed certain goals , but five years , the time scale laid down for the implementation of chapter iv of the treaty , is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require .    4.197034336968393
my second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system , adopting common procedural rules and , above all , putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons .    3.6123404692990206
the recent laws on aliens adopted in my country , spain , and in belgium , are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy .    4.556711384687259
my third and final point relates to the external activities of the union in the field of immigration and asylum .    3.756440180511145
we must not and cannot give the impression that the union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants .    3.335465279825664
we must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the east and the mediterranean area , but we must do so with rigour , with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions , which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to UNK in order to meet their most essential needs .    4.2117429675325475
finally , in relation to the charter of fundamental rights , the citizens of europe need to have a vision of citizenship .    3.730718268582413
the euro , employment , even security , are not enough .    3.749963761091569
they need a ' european soul ' , as a distinguished spanish professor once said .    3.6485687325808276
this UNK ' s words were like music to our ears as mr UNK has said .    3.532767489259608
as with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly UNK .    3.438566432567609
many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .    3.063441508049812
the tune that will be played will be one that the people of europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .    4.2417808493964575
as described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant UNK we heard during the european election and over the last few months .    3.3795704695194293
the amsterdam treaty and the tampere council built on this project for an area of freedom , security and justice in the european union .    2.983124732764122
one area though is extremely important , and this house must be involved in it : namely scrutiny .    4.639807314388518
and we must make certain that the details are applicable , appropriate and relevant to the different countries .    3.8070080224497365
i should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon , one or two of which were referred to earlier on .    3.559080884026415
i welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime .    3.942290052141532
that is an area that european citizens will respond to and will be happy about .    4.368578302409567
but the commission and council must know that there are many people in this house who have reservations about the eurodac system , for example .    4.311142352095315
we accept the UNK role of the council in this , but there are reservations and i am sure that the council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .    4.4844899207379285
mr schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of ' scoreboard ' .    3.235065802850562
anyone who is english or british or follows UNK knows what a scoreboard is .    2.8727074843673774
a scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up - to - date and it has to be clear and visible .    3.9511911069278547
i am sure that commissioner vitorino will make certain that is so .    3.301074883717647
at the end of six months i hope that the music is still playing and that the european people are still listening .    5.072153260351062
mr president , i would like to welcome the president - in - office and his colleague from the justice ministry , mr costa , and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed .    2.8401184402281094
amsterdam and tampere have given us much work to do together , as the excellent draft resolution by mrs terrón today shows .    4.418562733315855
i would like to make three brief points .    2.5687756671032793
the first is that we need a mature dialogue between the council and the european parliament .    3.639104381904685
it is barely six months since amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together ; we have been UNK each other up , we have had a few minor UNK , but we need to work effectively together .    4.576766709497224
let us stop the shadow - UNK . let us drop the elaborate UNK and let us respect the duties that the treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate .    3.142203247101567
involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process .    3.347440409748757
let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area .    3.2118344215313295
my second point is that we need a properly resourced commission .    3.085566242924045
we have established a new directorate - general , yet it has only 70 people all told .    3.183504216603076
there is an agreement to double this number , but i understand that , so far , not a single new person has arrived .    4.092884896194489
we are setting the commission a massive task , not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard .    3.666402885677499
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resources that the commission needs .    4.487330470238703
finally , on the content of the debate , i welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom , security and justice at the top of its agenda .    3.996343109394016
all good things come in UNK , especially in our policy area .    4.559013579129394
two hundred years ago it was liberty , equality and fraternity , and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others .    3.0009846491816217
now it is freedom , security and justice , and i hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of commissioner vitorino and resist the temptation to UNK security , important as it is , above the equally important needs of freedom and justice .    3.4621966716150103
although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice should be mentioned , we must remember that there is still room for progress .    3.566660136578835
the unilateral decision by belgium to re - establish border controls is a clear illustration of this .    3.3768124683083967
the decision to establish a charter of fundamental rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic , including all people , whatever their nationality , or excluding some .    3.3103000871875987
the total lack of progress in european citizenship and the political rights of all european residents is to be regretted .    4.086179993623211
although action plans established by the high - level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future , these plans do nothing to improve human rights , civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned .    3.912337765322389
we know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements .    3.413050234686137
yet these represent a serious threat to the principle of ' non - UNK ' [ no turning back ] .    3.380177509507025
furthermore , it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the council by a procedure without debate and without consulting parliament .    3.2435720024410117
however , the main concern remains .    3.162912347510812
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
mr president , i would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the council as well as the commissioner .    3.736262815727419
i thank them for their statements to the house .    3.4171560313227034
rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered i would like to deal with one specific topic : the question of drugs and how we tackle the UNK of the drug culture in our societies .    4.440600722337883
i look to the portuguese presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the finnish presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the member states .    3.9775712612890977
we already have , on the international side , plans in place to combat drug trafficking , money laundering and so on .    3.802736891200526
but to bring it down to a more human level : to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs , and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation ; secondly , to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws ; thirdly , to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people ; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of " normalisation " and " harm reduction " and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people .    3.569464214435866
mr president , i would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which i am entitled to point out , or remind , the representative of the commission that , in belgium , the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence , right to be UNK with their families , etc .    3.7147381707632006
this is a belgian government measure which flies in the face of the schengen treaty .    2.9058492193156322
i lodged a written complaint on the same subject to commissioner vitorino on 23 december .    3.2500201429257682
i would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me , within the foreseeable future , of the steps the commission will take to penalise this violation of the schengen treaty by the belgian state , in accordance with article UNK of the treaty .    3.99311876944308
mr president , esteemed gentlemen from portugal , especially the council representatives , you face great expectations on our part .    3.4095539660459275
i should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .    3.5355827158753437
i refer to eurodac .    2.8928463123851818
you will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the european parliament in december that eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system , as a community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications , in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and , above all , in order to set out clearly which member state was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure .    4.4770340870527
we voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument , together with an implementation committee , which would be attached to the commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be .    4.689909557141105
we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality .    2.2905181561845334
even in tampere , we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality .    2.7859173011530896
however , the council then took another direction at the very next summit in december and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected , i . e . that the council should continue to be responsible for implementation , that the regulatory committee would be attached to the council and that , where possible , UNK would still be used to exert pressure .    4.332456475638189
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .    3.679167255528499
my urgent request on behalf of the group is that you do everything to ensure that eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures .    3.9644821884845154
if you tell us today how you wish to proceed , you will be doing us a great service .    3.9712213932667
i refer in particular to the council and to the inertia of the member states in implementing the decisions they had jointly made .    4.201603610946621
however , the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions , such as the decision to begin implementing the treaty of amsterdam , the decision to incorporate the schengen agreement into the community pillar , and the decision of the cologne council to create a charter of fundamental rights and the decision of the extraordinary european council in tampere to bind the member states to common UNK , priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom , security and justice .    3.61139489300018
without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made , we , the european parliament , would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the council to implement these decisions in many areas , as well as its lack of common vision and , in particular , the lack of transparency and cooperation with the european parliament .    4.453866547930265
from what i have said , it must be obvious to you that the european parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer .    4.190876515068223
neither will it stop raising vital issues . for example , how much progress are you willing to make and what measures , legislative or otherwise , will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings , child pornography on the internet , drugs , and organised crime ?    3.4211635621854466
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration ?    3.632070957889967
how do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the community , reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of europe ?    3.4428420213742337
in light of this new international demographic class UNK by experts at the un , is it not about time you abandoned your traditional , conservative views on refugees and immigrants ?    3.5459774160371715
i have great expectations for the portuguese presidency .    3.332619192579882
mr president , i welcome much , indeed most , of what has been said in this debate .    2.947200730269697
but i want to add a word of caution .    4.075801626515427
we risk having not too few UNK of rights in this community , but too many : national , european union and european convention ; not too few UNK having the final say about our rights but possibly too many - there is the court across the river there , there is the court in luxembourg .    3.750897730546092
there are also courts in UNK , london , lisbon , dublin and edinburgh .    3.3124911545296456
we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .    3.5685239853789192
we must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights , for that would be the enemy of freedom , justice and security .    3.473237904870183
we need , in short , to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these .    3.4717677270158465
but we must look always to subsidiarity .    3.1573636755215686
like everybody in this house , i want freedom , justice and security . i do not want to see these degenerate into over - centralisation , chaos and confusion .    3.8876570278250435
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would very quickly like to make one point . various members raised questions about the portuguese presidency .    3.056596652474887
the president of parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal , and my colleague , the minister for justice , and i therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week .    4.335002420906845
( sustained applause )    3.363981346246412
thank you , minister .    3.088557054614412
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
mr president , i am grateful for the council ' s oral , and also written , reply .    3.5545820243745867
their efficiency has been truly remarkable .    3.1421731804579878
i will save a few seconds because i wanted to propose to the council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the committee on citizens ' rights and freedoms , justice and home affairs .    3.494893160965205
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the commission as well .    4.76522291767017
personally , i am pleased with some of the replies , for example , in relation to issues as sensitive as schengen and the europol convention , which we hope will be reviewed , and i am pleased with the words of the minister for justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities .    4.034271353548844
i also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control .    3.685679173611822
representatives of the council , within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this parliament .    4.836589406908768
i am sure that , with the willingness that you have shown today , the first thing you will do , in this new climate of understanding between us , will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you .    4.965818162050878
question time ( council )    2.6418022395480705
the next item is question time ( b5 - 0003 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the council .    2.1080383775823575
question no 1 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.871389297951055
subject : construction of nuclear plant in earthquake - prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than 7 on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey ' s persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu , while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes .    1.5215876152247458
turkey ' s nuclear plans b which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region b prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey ' s political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons , as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan .    1.7344865301157566
what steps will the council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget ?    1.955395884683792
mr president , the council wishes to point out that turkey is a signatory to the convention on nuclear safety , the objectives of which should UNK the fears expressed by mr souladakis .    3.397256645577758
the aim of this convention , which came into force on 24 october 1996 , is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation .    3.6240511674523574
it further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks , so as to protect individuals , society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the UNK radiation that can be UNK by such installations .    4.24000579079729
the convention , as you will be aware , also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur .    3.8152619585828282
i would also like to remind members that , as a candidate for membership of the european union , turkey will - and this is a pre - accession condition , which is an important point - sooner or later , as part of its own pre - accession strategy , have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time , and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety .    3.784680549846983
thank you for your answer .    2.2765591726319943
however , i would just like to add the following .    3.161095679527659
turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2 % with this unit .    2.894966460306692
nevertheless , rumour has it that it plans to buy UNK reactors of the type acquired by pakistan and india which were used for nuclear weapons .    2.834647041039507
in this respect , the issue requires closer examination , because the sensitive situation in the caucasus region could UNK people ' s suspicions .    3.8368217808323317
my second point concerns the safety of these plants .    3.1031797090860866
in areas of high seismic risk , it is not enough just to have secure , earthquake - proof buildings . speaking as an engineer , i can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances .    3.3430280794826377
however , we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation ; it is just not possible .    3.5069848818052356
with this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes .    3.1617171963397954
that is our role and this is the point of my question .    4.634579208507562
i recognise the relevance of the arguments that mr souladakis has put forward .    3.323967911249347
this is , of course , a highly sensitive issue .    3.056290508659336
furthermore , it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect turkey , in view of that country ' s proximity to the existing territory of the european union . it also affects other states neighbouring the eu with which we maintain relations .    4.366327057777828
we understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them , particularly during the discussions that we will be having with turkey to define that country ' s own pre - accession strategy agenda .    4.501068159396592
thank you , mr president and thank you president - in - office of the council .    2.494906694097405
i am sure the president - in - office of the council is a very nice man and is very kind to his UNK and his children and his UNK .    3.1757134765690838
however , forgive me if i am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me .    3.493381031700406
i do not believe that the statements made within the council and the votes are available to the public immediately .    3.8303113290107156
will you please therefore undertake , before the next plenary in february , to write and tell me where i can find this information on behalf of the public , immediately the council has passed legislation , rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list .    3.9898496253031164
will you write to me before the next plenary with that information ?    3.2439419697821683
mr newton dunn , i would first like to say that i do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question , and i would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future .    3.8459628183611274
with regard to what you were saying , it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the council , apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note , does not actually refer to the opacity , shall we say , of the legislative process , but rather almost to an excess of transparency .    4.9228300387792405
however , i would like to say , mr newton dunn , that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable .    4.0045939128938715
we have no problem , mr newton dunn , in repeating this information to you in writing , but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here , because that meets the requirements of the treaty exactly .    4.179767444193493
we therefore consider that the general secretariat of the council is at present making available to the public all essential information regarding the council ' s functions as a legislative body .    4.174586989438465
i do not consider that the council tried to answer my question .    3.38438725169218
i did not ask what the council thought of the proposal which the commission has still not tabled .    4.63052506418986
instead , my question concerns the interpretation in principle of article 255 of the treaty of amsterdam .    3.116200191117819
does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the european union referred to there ?    4.27140688657699
i should like to have an answer to that question .    2.968042353299759
does the council consider that , on the basis of article 255 of the treaty , national legislation on transparency can be regulated , that is to say legislation not relating to the eu ' s institutions ?    3.712217960602826
mr sjöstedt , the answer that i gave was the only answer possible .    3.7144318763381086
nevertheless , i would like to say that any interpretation of article 255 of the treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity .    3.4528747083833005
at the moment , there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this article , and unless there is such a proposal , we cannot move forward on this matter .    3.7800692665479154
in any event , article 255 does not , at first sight , allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity .    3.2807011230310508
i am , up to a point , concerned about how the council will fight for the principles contained in the treaty of amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision - making process .    3.791131228848327
how is this to be done when , at the same time , the commission ' s proposal - which has been leaked , so the general public is aware of it - says that employees ' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents , reports , drafts etc ?    4.21120524198081
does not the council ' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision - making process ?    4.4250469151955265
mrs UNK , the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last intergovernmental conference .    3.941958510500613
i would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the community institutions " UNK " , it also applies between the institutions .    3.672121009993839
by this i mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the community institutions ' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions , and not only as regards the commission ' s relationship with parliament , but also as regards the commission ' s relationship with the council .    4.7392411041219855
as a matter of fact , at the last conference , this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions .    3.7021033921718356
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference .    3.3896663522701824
the matter is still open .    3.518260229073504
genuine transparency of the institutions ' workings and the way they are presented throughout europe is an extremely important issue and one which , in my opinion , needs to be studied again , particularly in the context of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference .    4.306176453349743
we have no doubts about this and we think that the members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again .    3.9388568247870683
i believe that the commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but i think that there is always room for improvement in this matter .    4.363133614817656
for our part , we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area .    3.5470042459434326
it is a very important question indeed which UNK sjöstedt and others have asked .    2.9882473414559225
we have a principle of transparency in sweden which UNK democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens , decision makers and authorities .    3.6845897090687596
we are very anxious indeed that the eu , too , should move in this direction , and this is also stated in the treaty of amsterdam .    4.090185876866811
one or two years ago , parliament adopted a report by mrs UNK which is extremely important in this context .    4.802065862150404
the report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the member states .    3.2215492989312087
we can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from parliament .    3.843143930550754
i listened very carefully to what mr seixas da costa had to say on transparency and the intergovernmental conference .    3.498188917841388
my concern is , if i have understood mr seixas da costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the igc , whether the portuguese presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the intergovernmental conference .    3.6436923637522165
after all , examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though i know full well the importance of these lobbies .    3.389805103851704
it should have its own heading in the agenda of the intergovernmental conference , which would mean widening the agenda .    3.350661153340717
mr dimitrakopoulos , transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions .    3.6450719638463798
this intergovernmental conference will , at the outset , concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate , particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic , more transparent and more efficient .    3.9971215015324097
all of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims .    3.3684346650067187
it is obvious that transparency will be a permanent UNK on the european agenda and it will , of course , feature on the agenda of this intergovernmental conference .    4.490522547815394
i can assure you that this is an issue which the portuguese presidency will keep before the member states and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference .    3.7826659066319843
it must therefore be able to count on the support of the members of the european parliament , who will surely UNK behind this proposal .    3.793106875737825
we will then see , at ministerial level , how we can follow this up .    3.5104052717682923
it should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the treaty of amsterdam , which was approved last may , and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress .    4.690036998927112
the question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency .    3.9913554873580694
my feeling is that , in spite of everything , this issue will always have to be on the agenda , because the public is clearly concerned about it , and because it is linked with the need to make the european institutions accountable to the public .    5.334682080321635
as far as we are concerned , they will be .    3.438794931725711
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter .    3.413857614702617
question no 5 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.2161547249133093
subject : proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000 , and the case of anchovies in particular the latest reports from the international council for the UNK of the sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ices zone viii is critical .    4.103632018105155
have the council of fisheries ministers and the commission assessed the impact of UNK the portuguese quota for ices zones xi and UNK and UNK zone 34 . 1 . 1 to france ( UNK metric tonnes per year overfishing ) on the ices zone viii anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future ?    4.070169813144603
does the council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established tac of 33 000 metric tonnes per year , given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks ?    3.005150415907253
what measures does the council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?    3.5108109829672065
mr president , the portuguese presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question , particularly because it UNK an issue which concerns portugal in a positive way , and i shall explain how .    4.179690495575624
the council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay to which mr ortuondo larrea refers .    3.282373174383575
nevertheless , at the last fisheries council of 1999 , held on 16 and 17 december , the member states involved in this area of fishing , namely france , spain and portugal , considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a tac reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes , as the commission proposed , was excessively cautious .    4.005024597092977
a compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks , that is the species of fish being affected , and the socio - economic problems caused by fishing limits . this was achieved by fixing the tac at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999 .    4.001050742719915
it was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species , of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year .    4.106833299469469
as for the southern stocks of anchovy in ices zone ix , the tac was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999 .    3.12916951451584
fishing quota transfers between portugal and france were reduced UNK from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000 , for fishing in french waters .    3.166316856955141
i would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall , over the whole community fishing area .    3.239179987896984
in accordance with the principle of relative stability , 90 % of stocks of anchovy in the bay of biscay are allocated to spain and only 10 % to france .    2.841140945630276
without this transfer from portuguese waters , the level of the bay of biscay tac would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to france .    3.6228322591875872
that is why i think that this is quite positive from portugal ' s point of view .    3.150598573752198
this situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by mr ortuondo larrea , which we also understand .    3.7305922613813367
mr president - in - office of the council , i must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all .    2.5574479838229824
i understand that portugal is affected by this .    3.210400201783415
however , it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that 80 % of the anchovies , which , until 1995 , were being fished in the portuguese fishing grounds , through an agreement between that member state - portugal - and france , should now be fished in the bay of biscay and that the council of ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay or the UNK sea .    3.6841954080213024
it has been shown , as we have been claiming since 1995 , that this move is appalling , and , if portugal and france wish to reach an agreement , that is fine by us , but these anchovies should be fished in portuguese fishing grounds and not in the bay of biscay .    4.024468971003586
today , scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the bay of biscay is in danger of UNK , and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that bay .    4.210160776190253
i do not know if you are aware , representatives of the council of ministers , of your responsibility over these last few years , and in 2000 as well , for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the UNK UNK .    4.150332234498655
i would like to say , mr ortuondo larrea , that in its judgement of 5 october 1999 , the european court of justice ruled that this transfer , which was approved , was in accordance with the principles laid down in council regulation 37 / 60 / 92 and , specifically , with its article 9 ( 1 ) , which stipulates that member states may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated .    3.837131836585342
the court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to spain in zone viii had been maintained at 90 % and france ' s at 10 % .    3.156370004120909
apart from this , mr ortuondo larrea , the court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between portugal and france does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and UNK resources in a rational and responsible way , on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones viii and ix neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to spain .    3.4012143876736918
accordingly , mr ortuondo larrea , the council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer , greater account would be taken of france ' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the bay of biscay .    3.1511716726855963
the council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen .    2.835266029587175
in concrete terms , 3 000 tonnes represent 57 . 5 % of portugal ' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73 . 9 % in 1999 .    3.085149534391156
these numbers represent , in our opinion and in the opinion of the council , a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80 % laid down in council regulation UNK / 95 .    4.767970647745958
question no 6 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8800564564752373
subject : measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of serbs and romanies in kosovo on 2 december 1999 , nato ' s defence ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo ' s minority communities .    3.261613362662342
in its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against serbs and romanies , parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the serb population and calls on the leaders of the kosovo albanians to fully respect un resolution 1244 .    2.856584319226712
the resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings , UNK , detentions , intimidation , UNK , looting , destruction of property and the taking - over of houses etc .    3.141785379856302
in the light of the above , will the council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of kosovo , as requested by parliament ?    3.8023407977404653
what other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing ?    3.228906445363442
mr alavanos , i would like to say that i have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised .    3.329506974051543
we genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in kosovo for ethnic minorities , for both the serb and romany populations , and the incidents of discrimination , harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region .    3.8146352863992607
the council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to UNK such acts .    3.8473953920490485
the council once again reiterated the need , in its december conclusions , to fully implement security council resolution 12 / 99 and has consistently supported bernard kouchner ' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and , in particular , to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region ' s multi - ethnic make - up are effectively implemented .    3.2262341936706695
in our contacts with senior political figures amongst the kosovo albanians , we have stressed - and the portuguese prime minister did this very recently - that persecution of the serb population , the romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable .    3.3892043233575624
it will not be tolerated , and must stop immediately .    3.644395057838832
it has been UNK explicitly and repeatedly to kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non - albanian minorities are treated .    3.094203224519027
i think that this is an extremely important point : this sense of conditionality , which underlies the european union ' s position , is being maintained by the council and will continue to be maintained .    3.829036861651617
we have fully supported the efforts of the united nations mission and the international security forces in kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .    3.502442395681973
kfor and the UNK police consider one of their two main tasks to be preventing any form of maltreatment on the grounds of a person ' s ethnic origin .    3.594421938906446
the council therefore expressed its satisfaction , in its december conclusions , at the substantial contributions announced by the european commission , which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal , together with similar contributions made by member states .    3.7034153216727295
nevertheless , mr alavanos , the council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in kosovo does not match the desired amount , in terms of what the various member states have been able to raise , and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground .    4.243167901437865
we shall nevertheless continue to devote all our attention to this problem because the entire credibility of the authorities and of the organisations representing albanians in the region also depends on the ability of these organisations to prove themselves capable of implementing measures which will guarantee the region ' s multi - ethnic nature .    3.562615056091858
i would like to thank mr president - in - office of the council .    1.9477166899353107
i believe - as i think we all do - that portugal , its former president , mr soares , and its government , maintained a cautious and middle - of - the - road stance during the UNK in the balkans .    3.851547860958967
today ' s political statement on this issue was very positive indeed , and one which i welcome .    4.581023087530956
however , there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the european union .    3.3800971327657576
unfortunately , we have recently witnessed the eradication of serb , romany , turkish , and UNK minorities in kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next .    4.325607547098822
this failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was UNK to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side .    3.78826513821818
and so i would like to repeat my question as to whether the council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with mr kouchner , who has a major responsibility for the situation in kosovo today .    3.9661570490480544
mr alavanos , i cannot agree with what you just said in your last sentence on mr kouchner ' s responsibilities , and i would like to make two very important points here . the structure being implemented in kosovo is under the auspices of the united nations .    3.399557591719545
it is a structure to which the european union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the european union have contributed in various ways .    4.234061827064216
there is one thing , however , that we cannot deny , and that is that mr kouchner ' s efforts to return kosovo ' s internal situation to normal have been extremely positive .    3.9069359296368535
this is undeniable , even if you - or indeed we - consider that some of the results of these efforts , for reasons beyond mr kouchner ' s control , have not been as effective as we would all have liked them to be .    4.3382190336277064
i have one last point to make , which is about the european union ' s responsibility and , specifically , in this case , about possible action by the council in this matter , and the responsibility of the international community , which has overall responsibility for the situation in kosovo .    5.298712153489114
therefore , the responsibility of the european union has to be seen in a certain context .    3.8912788159960114
it is the international community , and specifically the united nations , which should be held responsible for implementing resolution 12 / 99 and , in particular , for the thinking behind this resolution and for the compatibility of this resolution with reality .    4.266273736314358
these are questions which we should all be asking , but the forum for putting these questions is the united nations .    3.7353611073864013
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , i heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities .    3.6456978996667444
i think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public .    3.200347662977606
the question which i therefore ask myself is this : has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area , how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence ?    4.5271610319594755
we have endeavoured to provide material help .    3.154767437152927
we have tried to defend peace by taking military action .    2.9665187104121404
what is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here ?    3.4099533368043806
mr rübig , as i said , i understand your concerns very well .    3.8641599023658384
i think that , at the moment , particularly in the last few months , there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to mr kouchner , in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently .    4.612615266310201
i heard mr kouchner speak at the council of europe ministerial meeting on this issue , and i think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed . in other words , he has been given these resources .    4.870349743258192
there are two fundamental questions in particular .    3.088151948933726
firstly , an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and , in particular , in protecting certain sections of the civilian population . secondly , an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in kosovo to be kept on .    3.6952922385773572
the issue which we should all raise , and i did so myself , in a diplomatic way , a while ago , concerns the very substance of security council resolution 12 / 99 .    4.097008181593598
i know that this is an extremely delicate issue , but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented .    3.469701698730471
we advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety .    4.404972339047905
what we have to do , and we in the european union are already doing it , is to guarantee mr kouchner all the necessary resources , and you are right , mr rübig , we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used .    4.822893845567716
we in the council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the portuguese presidency .    4.356559363622705
mr seixas da costa , i totally agree with you .    2.910168679599068
the problem is not mr kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working , namely resolution 1244 .    3.420234581805264
having said this , the eu ' s responsibility , which is both yours and ours , is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region .    3.8968305537021903
it is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses , accidents and UNK mentioned by mr alavanos .    3.1562051199223036
does the council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of kosovo ?    3.4536432412369575
if so , does it intend to do so within a general UNK of the region , avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro - states , as has tended to happen elsewhere , and reuniting the parties , in this case kosovo and albania ?    4.260560598797078
question no 8 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8597642015927816
subject : new interreg initiative in point 1 of annex 2 to its draft communication on interreg entitled : promotion of urban , rural and coastal development , the commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross - border strategy .    3.389509163810374
however , housing is specifically excluded .    3.035419398583064
given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest , including small UNK , and , given the need , for a variety of reasons , to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas , does not the council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by interreg ?    4.219772837133595
mr president , the council and , i think , the portuguese presidency in particular , are extremely aware of the importance of the problems mr gallagher ' s question raises and i would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to community policies for the development of rural areas .    4.426242306920966
i would like to point out that in may 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth community reference framework for sustainable rural development .    3.1337780288838433
this was , as you know , one of the changes made during the agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at community level .    3.991867394335479
through the european agricultural guarantee and guidance fund , the eaggf , this community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of UNK rural areas , an issue you are quite right to raise .    3.6317068458676114
on the other hand , the european regional development fund , the erdf , also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion , by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion .    3.4697433265965576
in this regard , we should bear in mind that the erdf also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas .    3.017923213843124
this combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today , furthermore , is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also , have developed and changed .    4.307277288632133
we think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy , and the eaggf , of course , has a crucial role to play in this .    4.433602195328841
question no 9 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    1.8670251916369824
subject : farming and the portuguese presidency will the council outline the priorities of the portuguese presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health UNK ?    3.805673533500853
your question on the common agricultural policy is one which we take very seriously and which should always be considered in this house ' s discussions , because in the future we are likely to discuss this issue at great length .    4.5107056734351785
during the portuguese presidency , we will be continuing discussions on the cap , by adapting some of the common market organisations with a view to developing the union ' s rural areas in an appropriate way and guaranteeing an improvement in farmers ' incomes , paying particular attention to measures which could have an impact on small family - run farms .    4.136301941323093
on the other hand , the portuguese presidency will continue , if and when the new wto round begins within its term of office , which is by no means guaranteed , to ensure that the presence of community production on international markets is strengthened . it will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported community farm products and preserving the multifunctional european agriculture to which i have just referred .    3.595081349988046
the portuguese presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and i think that the portuguese foreign minister and president - in - office already referred to this aspect this morning .    3.7886845350069125
we shall be developing it in four parallel schemes , in the agriculture council , the health council , the consumer affairs council and the internal market council .    5.115188703200369
at the UNK maria da feira european council meeting in june , the portuguese presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the commission presented in its white paper a few days ago .    4.2085344480515765
we think that the task we now have of establishing a european agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market , to stabilise confidence in this market , to break down some of the tensions between member states in this area and even - it has to be said - to give the european union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety .    4.4631899550865315
this is what we shall be trying to achieve during the portuguese presidency and we hope , at the end of it , to be able to present the result of our efforts to this house .    4.787998446211258
i thank the president - in - office for his reply .    2.7170045554917848
i am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the european model which is based on family farming , mainly those farmers involved in beef and UNK production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs .    3.6867765717883736
i would like to ask what new steps the council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks , in particular , against the UNK and factory - style production of the usa and new zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for european farmers extremely difficult and where , of course , european standards of food safety do not apply .    3.8249050686969186
i completely understand your concerns , and i feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the european union itself on this issue .    4.3634594565187985
we also have to think of the consequences , especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers .    3.900061853380888
nevertheless , as you know , this issue is now in the hands of the european commission and it will have to take this further .    5.356196844177023
the council ' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited .    3.966492335930549
mr president , i too would like to welcome the president - in - office to the chamber .    2.4210489399081534
but i do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the portuguese presidency would be willing to meet the non - governmental organisations actively involved in this field .    3.604470164535304
i appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi - disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency .    3.8260026069092237
my specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the president - in - office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level .    4.119853762756263
i feel this is one area where europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the UNK for exchange of experience and best practice among the member states .    3.8986861152974575
mr crowley , with regard to the presidency ' s scope for supporting actions by non - governmental organisations , particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless , i would like to say that such initiatives are welcome , and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them .    3.8104799959537106
we have worked closely with portuguese ngos and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the portuguese presidency , which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme .    3.35416356166082
we have no specific , concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by ngos in this area might be considered during our presidency .    4.225885612089154
any aspect of this which may UNK on the commission ' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the commission itself .    4.720420754548227
mr president - in - office of the council , you have talked a lot about the future , about what the commission will do , and what the presidency will do in lisbon , etc . however , you also said something which i find particularly UNK .    4.042961029297549
you said that in lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development .    3.394078945725957
i am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead , partially at least , to exclusion .    3.318592393254695
i do not see how you could , with the views that you hold , provide any answers .    3.5913033771815126
what i asked and what i am once again asking is the following : what are the views of the portuguese presidency on , for example , the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion , the division of work and social security , the implementation of tax policies , particularly for speculative capital , and the policy of redistributing wealth ?    4.656349861120381
i would like an answer as to whether or not the portuguese presidency intends to do something about these matters .    3.995569989424354
you must understand that a presidency ' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited .    3.05491143979184
i think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the commission ' s own scope for intervening , through its right of initiative .    3.670021113340536
i have spoken about the special european council and about portugal ' s initiative in convening it , and i have spoken about the future , because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion .    4.219896202392658
one of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion . the second is to create internationally competitive conditions , which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the european union , and this will have positive knock - on effects on the problems of social exclusion .    4.29448704188931
the portuguese presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can , in six months , resolve problems that have always existed .    3.814600762250227
it is prepared to act on proposals by the commission in any area for which there is community competence .    4.256098748086043
it also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented , specifically by non - governmental organisations , but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters .    3.7261741061706606
we should , however , also bear in mind , mr papayannakis , that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact , armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months .    3.992438084151095
we will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency .    2.9163927218485943
question no 12 by ( h - UNK / 99 ) :    2.2159058877139186
subject : portuguese presidency and development policy will the president - in - office of the council make a statement on the priorities of the portuguese presidency with regard to development policy , the convention of lomé and tackling famine situations ?    3.9699810653102543
i would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question , and indeed the minister who spoke to the committee on development last week in brussels outlining the position .    3.500975457863444
but there are some questions still outstanding .    3.2805118490666283
there does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against aids in the programme .    3.971752068022996
the situation of aids in africa now is so serious that more people are dying of aids than are dying in conflict .    3.184018457107492
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue .    3.094039278445794
i should like to ask the minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in ethiopia where there is drought , where the crops have failed , and where , in six months ' time , we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands .    3.8923423345075836
at the same time , there is a war going on between eritrea and ethiopia and the UNK industry in europe is not short in sending UNK , after which we will send the bread .    3.997460058844974
first of all , mr UNK , you must understand that i do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague ' s speech during the meeting of the committee on development . there is no contradiction between our two positions , quite the opposite .    3.943182439218489
unless we wish to act like UNK , we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face , particularly in the area of external relations .    3.9191387381345444
as you can understand , it would be easy to do so .    3.5478259850077687
all we would have to do is get a UNK of development and put all the items in our programme , one after the other .    4.281194550205081
we must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve , particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes .    4.3272118130420125
you have mentioned ethiopia , which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes , but there are , as you know , several community actions to combat aids , and in this respect , you are right , and the united states will probably not do any better .    4.453321738057567
indeed , in terms of development aid policy , i think that europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area UNK very favourably with that of the united states .    4.220906718135015
your question UNK to the subject of arms , a broader policy issue which i do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the council will , of course , address in the future , if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context .    4.721090126209762
is the council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the eu to developing countries at prices below the cost of production ?    4.438003162172127
does the presidency intend to do anything about this ?    3.69693346156294
since the author is not present , question no 13 lapses .    2.5802056438820626
i would like to thank the president - in - office of the council , and i would personally like to welcome him and the portuguese presidency .    2.71448648659438
please allow me to remark on how well - versed and well - informed he is on european affairs .    3.3334481453172202
unfortunately , in my case , he did not provide what i would call a satisfactory answer .    3.9892774786779506
since the council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .    4.119908106346156
saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is , i am afraid , just an excuse .    4.4337055416252475
my question , which has not been answered , is why , when the european parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the european union , the council and the commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether .    4.011405878408552
this is a true example of the council ' s indifference towards culture , despite its assurances to the contrary that it is a matter to which it attaches great importance .    4.484864579794959
mr marinos , we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the portuguese presidency , and therefore , the cultural dimension is , i am sure you will appreciate , one of our main concerns .    4.327417450122133
these cultural dimensions , however , almost always have their own economic dimension in turn , that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives .    4.630855930462685
this is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the european union , and especially within the framework of the council .    3.832999759036079
for our part , we shall be attempting to strengthen and consolidate the european position on cultural goods and services and on activities in this sphere , because we believe that this is an identifying feature which is crucial to the union ' s image and to the union ' s own particular identity .    3.890447565060198
this is , and will continue to be , connected with developments within the world trade organisation .    3.0919877930324615
as you know , both we and the council have addressed this issue appropriately .    3.2394315077144267
in specific terms , we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the commission for the next round of wto negotiations , at which this will be a central issue .    5.1807057620280785
nevertheless , i would like to add that with regard to cultural policy , and in particular the audiovisual dimension , the portuguese presidency will be paying very close attention to extending and enriching european audiovisual policy by adopting a media - plus programme which could go some way towards UNK europe ' s main fears .    3.4029902939661785
we also intend to initiate a new debate , a more innovative one , on the issue of europe ' s film heritage , given that this must be one of the most important factors in the development of a european cultural identity and of a european audiovisual economy .    4.320033570337378
the presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in europe , which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the portuguese presidency , in conjunction with the commission , in february 2000 .    3.954380608789067
but , mr marinos , in the eu context , culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with igc agendas .    4.3273003861798305
if , by chance , it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , then this could be suggested , both by member states , and by the members of the european parliament taking part in the preparatory group .    4.331417302254727
it remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this .    3.8331758044568276
we will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue .    4.208354985687788
mr president , i join others in wishing portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .    2.728863538270778
i notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next igc but if some people wished it , you would consider it .    4.030980938396566
well , i , and my fellow 35 british conservative meps wish it and would like you to please consider it .    3.440408018295822
i appreciate that it is a provocative question .    4.404289679303707
it is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold eu law in the respect which it deserves .    3.585450741333392
we have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can UNK with our citizens .    3.559276931417408
i cannot think of a better way to do it .    3.8262164546269437
can you ?    3.3047912103475166
the issue is whether the european dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the treaties .    3.563658374518272
this is an issue which , as you will understand , will have to be addressed at igc level and is an issue that only a special european council can authorise the portuguese presidency to pursue , because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming intergovernmental conference will take place .    4.310010536343477
intergovernmental conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of christmas tree .    3.849973284125769
it is therefore not out of the question that these issues , which crop up again and again , and which are passed from one conference to another , may be addressed .    3.6942361961704404
the problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the european union on this issue being included , particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included , other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference ' s agenda .    3.7847077388129136
mr dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion .    2.730433916331958
i would ask him to be brief .    2.797278865588715
mr president , i understand that i have to do this very quickly .    4.866668298145079
i liked what mr seixas da costa said about father christmas .    3.208556707281696
in spain they say a letter to the three kings .    2.7479594003751875
i simply wish to remind you that the european parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports .    3.3645532906822755
now the presidency and the council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings .    3.8550676500322045
we thank mr seixas da costa , but he can also write his letter to the three kings .    2.7074502333867843
i would merely say that the festive issue which mr dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one .    3.501587495538281
the problem is that in this case father christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so .    3.252547108562652
it is not the portuguese presidency ' s job to hand out the presents that everyone wants , especially those that the european parliament is asking for .    3.7979285712295
after this interesting exchange of opinions , and in accordance with the rules of procedure , i would like to tell you that questions nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing .    3.1726269056417298
that concludes questions to the council .    2.535807542533868
capital tax    5.129043170105564
the next item is the joint debate on :    1.968923672811476
the oral question ( b5 - 0004 / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the council , on the council position on the idea of a capital tax    3.9774501402865274
the oral question ( b5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mr désir and others , to the commission , on the commission position on the idea of a capital tax .    3.4767990632305326
between eur 1 500 and 2 000 billion are traded every day on the financial markets . in three or four days , this can equal the total figure of annual global production , or global gdp , of approximately eur 6 000 billion .    3.17190152164162
the bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .    3.2684738681201617
yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can , in a few hours , cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country , UNK its whole population into recession .    4.135623312574315
in view of this situation , renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by UNK tobin , winner of the nobel prize for economics , to create a tax on currency transactions . the rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments , but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation , thereby checking the multiplication of short - term transactions .    3.7159638544691
note that this proposed tax , which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people , would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation . yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere .    3.8510958962380646
one reason for the acceptance of this proposal , and of the campaigns by ngos such as attac , UNK or others which have UNK this proposal , is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries , in areas such as education or health .    4.528488195667974
it could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty .    3.7301598521165746
many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the UNK president , fernando UNK , the finnish government , the canadian parliament last march and also UNK jospin in 1995 .    4.069236870425018
this question has been debated in several national parliaments of the eu .    3.045370947222089
the common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the european union . this is the reason for the oral question to the council and commission which we have tabled with 37 other members .    4.673003444330686
i am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the gue / ngl , greens / efa , eldr and pse groups .    3.1054354778856386
this motion asks the commission to present a report to parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax . it also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens .    3.5006877955782
one of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex , but this could be said of any tax . if this argument had been accepted in the past , then no taxes would ever have been created .    3.975867963510649
the motion also asks that a position document , drawn up by the commission and council , should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the imf .    4.030517477960175
the european union must take the initiative and must also , as demanded in the motion , propose this initiative to the g7 because it is primarily a political question .    3.753402778349524
if the union takes the initiative , this will have a UNK effect because this debate is occurring all over the world , including in the usa and japan . a desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people , their parliaments , their governments and their democratic institutions .    4.145426168030501
europe must play a role in this new international regulation and i am extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question is now on the agenda of european construction .    4.853472553061471
madam president , i do not have a great deal to add on this subject .    3.367419682327754
the council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as professor tobin suggested .    3.1649530466315254
this is a creative initiative , which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in european politics , but the commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue .    3.95032994000972
as it falls to the commission to propose any such initiative , the council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue .    4.652292729747357
madam president , the revenue basis of the tobin tax is said to be made up of very short - term exchange transactions .    4.1367744280084
such transactions , according to the argument , bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables . this has also just been underlined by mr désir .    3.718150904237865
therefore , according to proponents , such as mr désir , an internationally applied tobin tax would , in principle , reduce speculative transactions and , hence , the volatility of exchange rates , which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity .    3.8966833042504416
taking into account the considerable volume of short - term financial streams , even a low nominal tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue .    3.169135713000801
in reality , the motive underlying the increased interest in the tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid - nineties was non - economic .    3.344053884378503
indeed , it was UNK by the potential of this tax to generate income for international , public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by .    3.5322761381001713
the commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax , such as the tobin tax , as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation , so to speak .    3.6353696182075823
mr désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides .    3.274153576762322
but if the tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency , then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market .    4.204678755239574
put more strongly , in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds , the tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off - UNK tax havens .    3.7523751086445793
in that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .    3.53544802604777
so the tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate .    4.331932803043441
finally , even if the tobin tax is designed to curb UNK with currencies , there is still the risk that even non - speculative streams would be affected , and that is not the intention .    4.1779349998537985
for the reasons set out above , i cannot see a good reason for introducing a european tobin tax .    3.5785024953495737
at any rate , the commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the european union .    3.810790692974784
in more direct terms , to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams , this would contravene the treaty of rome .    3.4110945613355383
the correct speculative approach , it seems to me , is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos , rather than attempting to UNK its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets .    3.738991761057897
madam president , commissioner , i should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question .    2.7728694230080753
we know what the problem is : instability on the markets as the result of speculation .    3.4648674701557103
but the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability , as the commissioner has just so impressively told us , is the result of speculation .    3.875566238994469
the tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the UNK in 1992 and 1993 or the crises in the south - east asian currencies in 1997 .    4.14624625952945
in my view , and i say this quite clearly , the question is UNK motivated rather than solution - focused .    4.048752588459859
i consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons .    3.1021436029438596
why do we reject the tobin tax and consider it so questionable ?    3.3321108867780143
first , and the commissioner has also confirmed this , because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets .    4.204584215534052
even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably .    3.5540014039824164
in addition , this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital , which is one of the central tenets of the internal market .    3.756332593544809
secondly , speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify .    3.2419385742210687
thirdly , unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time , tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes .    3.521628476121282
fourthly , technically speaking , this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control .    3.367213921103522
the measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .    4.796834992531804
we need stronger banking supervision .    2.956170011444377
we need to clarify the liability for transactions .    3.232922123499078
we need a framework of regulations at international level .    3.473577980715939
we need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up .    3.6208410729168303
i have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands .    4.114830528548674
i refer to point 9 .    3.2133152594990113
having listened to the commissioner just now , we know that the commission ' s knowledge of the facts will result in a ' no ' to the tobin tax .    3.824007381624348
if the knowledge of the facts and this debate and the arguments are as we say , and i think that they are right , then to take up another six months of the commission ' s time and occasion uncertainty on the financial and capital markets would be irresponsible .    4.731813669467471
the capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .    3.744615814009806
madam president , the debate on a tax on short - term financial actions is not a new one .    3.5626341182893992
we have been discussing the tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies .    3.4587310523063395
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short - term transactions really is .    2.8343361010087094
this question has now entered a different dimension , a dimension in which usd 1 500 billion UNK the world twenty - four hours a day looking for attractive investments , no more than 3 % of which have anything to do with the real economy .    3.1695262666417308
we are concerned about stability on the financial markets , not for the sake of the financial markets , but because this has to do with own growth , our own investments and our own jobs in the european union .    3.9640855313478345
we must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past .    4.049595496643934
we have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions , but so far we have had no working set of rules , as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the asian and latin american crises .    3.4397996645171434
it is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information .    3.0284569678172155
it is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is .    3.107932511914759
we must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice .    4.091480106934128
at a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout europe and internationally , we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short - term financial transactions .    3.882172986867344
i think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the commission , so that we as the european parliament can see if we need to ensure that the european union achieves real international solidarity with the usa and japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure .    4.663270086105747
this is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward - looking proposal .    3.611740321196018
madam president , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , i must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which , although it does not mention it in the text , appears to be an attempt to revive , as the introduction has done , the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by mr tobin , which our group opposed , clearly and totally , during the last legislature , with a series of arguments clearly and UNK expressed by our president , mr cox .    3.8591060321763573
i will have to repeat these arguments , UNK , in this intervention , because the same issue has arisen once again .    4.652564133831525
we do not agree with this type of tax because its application , in the event that it could happen , would not achieve the aims which mr tobin presented at the time and which the left in this house wishes to revive .    4.417074857080548
firstly , there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets .    3.2535830377330104
on the contrary , since it is certain that not all countries would accept it , we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility , instability , insecurity , opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level .    3.5421986490904716
furthermore , the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity , when we consider their application in practice , that it appears simply impossible .    4.022454590035157
this is a false debate whose aim is purely political , and has no basis or technical viability .    3.1929737224969985
furthermore - since we are in this european parliament - if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the commission within the european union , how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level ?    4.82519148318713
i suppose that the first thing they say will be , ' let us see whether you are capable of reaching a fiscal agreement within the union ' .    4.503336518880816
however , the liberal group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and , therefore , we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and UNK of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements .    4.3081438151267974
i am sure that this study - if carried out objectively , with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level - will show that it is neither suitable nor possible , not only in terms of its application , but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives .    3.6496656268229954
in itself , globalisation is positive .    4.088755627206673
the economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level .    3.066955808066051
this is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital .    3.2203652944706667
any analysis of economic development in recent years , if objective , will show , through the figures , that they have no political UNK or orientation .    4.26718964713082
as i have said , we are not opposed to such a study .    3.5707199607084386
we will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study , but we simply insist that , as this motion for a resolution points out , it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress , both on the level of states and on a general level .    4.809350101812555
madam president , commissioner , the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature .    3.3144394298565505
as mrs randzio - plath said , we must remember that the reason why certain members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic , social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries .    3.9824904945759587
the main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system .    4.211419589830699
in this respect , mr bolkestein , the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the tobin tax .    3.1477565860881036
if you look carefully , this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets .    2.832665134395877
secondly , the motion does not say that we want a solely european initiative .    3.5854012223564
this is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the international monetary fund so that the european union , in other words the commission and also the council , can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation .    4.254460119024407
there should be no confusion in this debate . as environmentalists , we do not want an excuse for a motion .    3.738531229504732
although a study produced by the commission would doubtless be interesting , we do not need another to add to those already available .    4.4321381981973955
we do need to obtain , from the commission and the council , in other words from each of the governments forming the union , a clear , positive or negative , political stance . they must indicate whether they are ready to defend , within competent public bodies such as the international monetary fund in the first instance , the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system .    4.385053136105657
as for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty , very short - term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short - term financial assets .    3.014947775144178
this argument is therefore not relevant .    3.793075171975973
however , i would highlight not only paragraph 9 of the motion , but also paragraph 10 .    4.080740080224775
we clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the international monetary fund . we therefore demand , if this motion is adopted tomorrow , that the commission and council appear before parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion .    4.083442046308663
madam president , my group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today , particularly as we have spared no effort along with members of other groups to bring this about .    3.562527808724474
obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning .    3.851957418912471
having said this , our group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents . this invites the commission to present a report within six months .    3.4691414812184225
the european parliament can play its role by taking the initiative , even if it does so UNK , on this subject . however , i agree with the previous speaker that , if paragraph 9 were challenged , this motion would clearly lose its substance .    4.353752669369535
this debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising . what are the respective places of people and finance in today ' s economy ?    3.5330076088707565
usd 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets . this represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services .    3.4261221103837727
by putting finance at the helm , this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere .    3.32099046504323
it has led to a growth in mergers , acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets .    2.823203246101565
unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing .    3.5704652678590825
openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries , to the point of collapse , as in asia , russia and brazil .    3.6232430560166615
faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets , demand , as our motion recognises , is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world .    3.616335622886338
in this respect , all ideas deserve to be considered , including the tobin tax which is important , just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged .    3.9788793050899645
this tax could help to check speculation without UNK the activities of the real economy . it could release new resources for investment in people and , at a time when the UNK estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be usd 40 billion per year , it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs .    3.3872253649388337
when the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global , the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators .    4.018517439072955
i would point out that the european union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and , like mr désir and several other speakers , i feel that the european union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .    4.335825601697796
in any case , the european parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well - being for everyone .    4.176946505360864
madam president , i too am delighted that we are having this debate . i only regret that it has been so long in coming .    4.029471027021967
we know that each generation has , over the course of time , blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology . this is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism , but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations .    3.889875669205142
free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or , rather , the big mistake of our UNK de UNK . this ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the UNK in the corridors of the kremlin or , before that , the certainty , elevated to the status of a dogma , that the earth was flat .    3.765241343398812
our world is now dominated by a single logic or , i could say , a single god of money at work instead of people at work .    3.6290667725382173
with a figure for trade in goods and services of UNK 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days ' speculation , the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals .    3.1710350073208136
it is self - perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man , the rich as much as the poor . yet it is the latter who , at the end of the day , are excluded from the majority of the world ' s decision - making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently , and very aptly , by jean - pierre chevènement as the globalised élites .    3.4066918722971287
it was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre , thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both UNK and irresponsible .    2.9494824905286503
however , the people are fighting back , as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible seattle summit . the leaders of the world , headed unfortunately by the european commission , UNK forward UNK , hoping that their UNK at the feet of the master of the world , mr clinton , would be enough to ensure them the UNK from the table .    3.91356566357227
yet they UNK without the salutary reaction of the UNK , both individuals and states . this reaction was more organised than previously , due in france particularly to the magnificent attac network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular .    3.5183720176611226
the creation of this taxation , of either the tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by professor UNK , could prove to be politically opportune , at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate . this is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a UNK in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of states .    3.4879785958875003
if the world ' s other important currency trading areas were to be excluded from the tobin tax , the fact that tax was liable to be paid in europe would lead to currency dealing moving to those areas .    3.956304818204792
this has already been made clear a number times in this debate .    3.3407076746334514
it is not enough that all the world ' s industrialised countries should be included in the scheme , as then currency trading would move to tax havens outside that group of countries .    3.2934758473915307
there should therefore be a universal application : it is not enough that the g7 countries or the other industrialised countries are involved .    3.700007552934691
on the other hand , it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time - and personally speaking , i do not believe we can achieve this - that the tobin tax dream might as well be buried .    4.065599286001248
furthermore , although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme , the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed .    3.5757801551806665
the world ' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used , for example , for a variety of well - meaning , un - backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them .    3.4908055109375846
with regard to the tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises , it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be UNK through taxation .    3.66742897316837
for that reason , as mr karas also said , we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value .    4.1696947431231415
this again would require measures to regulate the UNK and UNK of capital ; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way .    4.423505257127657
although it seems a reasonable scheme , the tobin tax is not without its problems , even if there should be agreement as to its implementation , which i do not believe there will .    4.600743001088371
it has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information , and that the global economy will , in the future , UNK more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital .    4.575873208178251
for that reason , the UNK flow of assets in massive UNK between the world ' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity , which has nothing to do with the real economy .    3.6529889679878487
if this ' UNK ' mechanism , which gives users the opportunity to make choices , were hampered by measures such as the tobin tax , mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it .    3.8851276618327963
madam president , i speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders .    3.4275634792754444
it seems to me UNK self - evident that some action is necessary .    3.0091791866853694
in the last 30 years , the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times : firstly , total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading ; secondly , annual global trade in real goods and services UNK just three - and - a - half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350 , that is , 1 % of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99 % are for speculation .    3.243359530884079
the size , UNK and UNK of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies .    4.093678864533395
computer - controlled selling programmes turned a random UNK into an avalanche , UNK jobs , lives and industries across the globe .    2.986456619309714
the only arguments against it are : firstly , it would UNK the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little UNK in light of the financial feeding UNK we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world , in east asia , europe and latin america .    3.935635130552758
mr UNK has described those who engage in this as the aids virus of the world economy .    3.7355829805682483
what is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators , UNK and option traders .    3.438049649330152
of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .    4.460001806842823
europe , japan and the us - the euro , the yen and the dollar , would constitute , in my opinion , such a block .    3.4511315167309697
i am disappointed in the epp .    3.350463033586257
i thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .    3.3467677823604154
yes , i am in favour of such a tax , but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow .    4.147359031449049
what we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the commission to study the matter , to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax .    4.200903976229061
equally i understand the commissioner failing to endorse such a tax , but i cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue .    4.197934064661392
there is nothing so closed as a closed mind .    2.992150605386271
the tax has the support of 47 % of the people in the uk , according to a recent survey by war on want .    4.463479128826554
in france it has had enormous UNK , particularly when linked to a demand to use the UNK to help the third world out of its debt and poverty .    4.306720233063586
this issue can no longer be ignored by parliament , the council or the commission .    4.197652413074979
there is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than : " it has not been done before " .    3.4174985181182875
in the new millennium , with new global problems requiring new global solutions , they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now , rather than why it has not been done in the past .    3.7171436335504935
madam president , commissioner , a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules .    3.4989584418357618
one of the main demands of the demonstrators in seattle was , rightly , the establishment of this type of tax , and this is not by chance .    4.211934319604086
the proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich european countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of UNK .    3.498702568739395
it UNK the need for solidarity with the countries of the south , particularly those in africa , the caribbean and the pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in seattle .    3.467051821845477
in order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries .    3.2569096870527816
this is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south .    3.6266328626436923
madam president , we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted ; we must also mention the fact , commissioner , that 80 % of these huge , daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days .    3.6286328976564644
we cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short - term sales of foreign currency and shares .    2.894629955792263
we cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action .    3.029932382596016
we cannot maintain a situation in which income from non - economic activities increases more and more quickly .    2.8446805292737953
it has been demonstrated in germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7 . 6 % of overall economic income since tobin developed his idea .    2.6838494122097947
we cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short - term currency fluctuations .    3.5446236661191652
nor do i believe that this is impracticable .    3.907132410391993
why should it not be possible for the g7 countries , the other eu member states , china , UNK and switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the tobin tax ?    4.864001533704577
there must be an overriding economic interest .    2.8502804455645894
why should it be impracticable , and it can be differentiated , to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions , all the so - called cash transactions , currency futures and options ?    3.4964734356791034
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long - term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short - term and speculative investments UNK .    3.2589194695229935
numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise , but the only real problem which i can see so far is one of political will and the st . UNK principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold .    3.8377386911794407
madam president , we are not asking for more bureaucracy , as mr karas put it just a few minutes ago .    3.8056827776961937
we are looking for solutions .    3.008266368865955
of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea .    3.612871622777859
the tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question .    3.519360877382114
" the more progress is made towards trade liberalisation , the more rules are needed " , as commissioner UNK said during the millennium round in seattle .    3.453304990849448
he recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the european union ' s construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations .    3.7474118186166248
now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary , all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions .    3.2593299244808613
we citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation .    4.475740999094062
honourable members , commissioner , it is often said that europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector , but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector .    4.276539279333197
if we look at the private sector , however , we will find not only that this UNK ' financial stability ' has been unsuccessful but that we are most probably sitting on a UNK ready to UNK at any moment .    4.349361937905444
the debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of stock exchange securities , the two main market stability indicators , have , for some time , been at danger levels , as the commission report on the economic situation in europe clearly illustrates .    3.640684700356789
the fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains .    3.081551827396002
speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are , in turn , generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely UNK .    3.7731033678010473
over - optimism will give way to disappointment and fear , which , in turn , will result in a stock market and economic crisis .    3.409748100111384
the danger is too great for us to ignore .    4.130535079301387
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .    3.474557174896076
that is what we are lacking , commissioner : the political will to make a start in tackling speculation .    3.4896300296455878
no longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of , or for this UNK approach towards , market forces as adopted by the liberals - and i am sorry that mr gasòliba i böhm has left - as this will only lead to its ruin .    3.548446978716849
madam president , mr bolkestein , the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable .    3.297695217627816
we needed a greek member to finally tell us what this tobin tax means .    3.125232848865518
you reject it UNK because you do not understand the first thing about it .    3.8587926438878695
that the right opposes taxes is quite understandable , except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions , or rather billions , into switzerland .    3.444715690162914
we all know that !    2.855477683915175
but now i call on you , in all consciousness , to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long - term projects with long - term capital .    3.904741714179042
it has never been done in south - east asia , it has never been done in europe , and i can understand why mr karas from austria has left the chamber , given austria ' s financial record .    4.06054582089343
they are all UNK with the same dirty brush !    4.098659150913385
we need a tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene .    3.836261258842789
madam president , i am totally UNK by the commission ' s , i . e . mr bolkestein ' s , political ignorance !    4.144025143785424
he should perhaps use his position on the tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all !    3.7296457042859044
madam president , i too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre .    3.496019012657771
it is perhaps not by chance that the conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western europe over recent decades .    3.078310160496897
if we continue down this path , and this is the ideology , and declare the financial markets to be UNK and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy , then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions .    3.862658688514873
those who own the monetary assets are currently UNK huge UNK which are again UNK out to be UNK .    3.348630787520928
we have asset inflation of global proportions .    2.923897884565639
as a result , speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets , causing growing economic instability which , in turn , jeopardises the entire economy .    3.0169925817569414
and it is precisely the medium - sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result .    3.6092005644267466
we can take action against this ; it is possible .    4.0901541627931275
the minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last , not only by the commission , but by reputable economic UNK throughout europe .    4.077251270945068
that too is feasible .    3.0103650729191784
and then perhaps everyone will stop UNK about arguments which are asking for trouble !    3.2208216010666204
it is not correct that the tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer .    3.600912020771069
the fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard UNK storage space for large european banks here at home must not be ignored .    3.274681045528002
in short , we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results .    3.463894632539068
madam president , let us indeed tax money speculation : it does not produce anything new .    3.4455444789658243
the tax would be targeted at the right place : at the speculators .    2.96951704872664
who is going to defend these speculators , when UNK and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?    3.226489056681676
article 73 c of the treaty establishing the european union provides scope for taxation on transactions .    4.2285040393889135
those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax - recycling centres , the tax havens , of which there are 62 in all .    3.5348761372433453
the union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .    3.076477437033409
the low rate tobin tax would not cause tax - recycling problems .    3.059194656665104
it is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect .    3.8129347591867355
the european union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries , and you see how we are today .    4.3960930405286955
in the end tax would UNK the global , undemocratic system of financial power .    3.291632314554546
ladies and gentlemen , we must challenge the monopoly the world ' s speculative UNK have on planning the world ' s economy by remaining outside the tax system .    3.707300470731586
madam president , may i begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and , above all of course , mr désir , for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening .    4.16725704437277
this is why it has been around for years , and it is satisfying that the commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response .    4.3030594043424015
i would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the member of your parliament , mr gasòliba .    3.4542306112917376
he said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and i share his view .    4.3164315113105385
i believe that globalisation has helped many countries which , so far , have been on the UNK of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and , as far as i am aware , no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade .    4.038318786467238
in other words , as indeed already remarked by mr gasòliba , globalisation is , in my view , positive , and i am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years .    3.9739300215647955
i think that he is correct in this regard .    3.2274132739792876
i too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates .    3.519106863273755
i am of the opinion that these are two important remarks , and that is why i am reiterating them here .    3.3171141362348484
madam president , could i furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the european union on the other ?    3.930960906067307
surely we are all familiar with the treaty of rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement .    3.8651828799337724
madam president , i can assure your parliament that my day - to - day work consists partly of attempting , in conjunction with my offices and colleagues , to completely integrate the financial markets within europe , thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible .    3.211714344670236
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market , i am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .    3.9124584813514516
you could hardly expect this commissioner to agree with a tax which would , in fact , impede international economic movement .    3.9041532478168026
once again , the tobin tax is , in my view , at odds with the treaty of rome , and this is an important , theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening .    3.8015103246617663
madam president , apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations , there are also practical objections to the tobin tax , as already underlined by mr karas and other speakers .    3.7420588582146124
it has unfortunately been observed , i have to say , that the european union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures . this indicates how difficult these dossiers are .    3.907573714274576
if we have not been able to reach agreement internally , i wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners .    3.806863716306938
i think that this will be problematic .    2.9284970543676936
madam president , mr jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets .    3.778510976523147
i think , however , that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes . i think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when , as already stated , the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the treaty of rome .    3.574420423308463
is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in english ' good governance ' ?    3.060560404412496
that the markets for production factors , including the labour market , operate flexibly ?    3.740900564738145
that is not always the case .    2.607835531825962
so if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability , then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first .    4.265394106427809
in addition - and this has also been mentioned already , for example by mr gasòliba i böhm , but also by others - there is a need for more supervision .    3.7590536105672037
more supervision nationally - supervision by national governments of national banks - and internationally , for example by means of the imf .    3.6270564160258285
madam president , according to various members of your parliament , more funding should still be made available for major projects .    3.5381196697070436
for example , mr UNK - UNK spoke in english about ' long - term capital for long - term projects ' - this is an obvious issue .    4.166271544727398
madam president , i should like to leave it here . as far as the resolution is concerned , of which i have seen a draft , the commission will await the vote and will , based on this , determine its stance .    4.6951837056431165
i thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate .    2.7649884488214975
i have received four motions for a resolution , tabled pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .    2.805357261086626
madam president , unfortunately i do not have your UNK of the french language .    4.923453594866534
but i would be obliged if mr bolkestein would just listen for a minute , which i think he cannot do at the same time as talking to mrs randzio - plath .    3.7299871485947973
could you please draw his attention to the fact that i have something to say to him ?    4.042307124648805
UNK bolkestein , UNK UNK UNK dire UNK chose !    3.939900353203735
unfortunately , my dutch is not as good as yours .    3.474425297892913
but i would rather like to say something else to you .    3.8630197444794616
parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a tobin type tax just to UNK the commission .    3.987585372029847
we want to examine the possibility of introducing a tobin tax .    3.32806819340904
it will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this .    3.5711811942407308
from a political point of view , i always UNK when people say , we neither need , want nor can we achieve these things !    3.340216251788114
it is not your job , it is our job to decide on that .    3.8848422453899563
it also has something to do with the newly awoken self - consciousness of this parliament .    2.9985087298693642
i just want to discuss it with you , no more and no less .    3.584425432203126
we can do so without going off at other UNK . i respect you as a serious commissioner who wants to take his work seriously .    3.244775789125349
please respect us as members of parliament who want to take our work seriously , and that includes the tobin tax !    4.51959730590297
madam president , an omission appears to have been made . in the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out , no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the pse , eldr , gue / ngl and greens / efa groups and by mrs UNK and mr coûteaux .    3.6653865604956413
mr désir , i note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution .    3.366246738467781
if the services of the presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled , it will be included .    4.50958512808028
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.623621155697488
( the sitting was closed at 8 . 14 p . m . )    1.9359012062513081
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.3506184552294846
mr president , i simply wanted to pass on some news . there was a terrorist attack this morning in madrid .    2.957705778970718
someone UNK a car bomb and one person has died .    3.334852251744612
on behalf of my group , i once again condemn these terrorist acts .    2.8324813985357857
thank you , mrs UNK UNK .    2.8127066104531284
we had heard about this regrettable incident .    3.0562481188669857
unfortunately , the terrorist murderers are once again punishing spanish society . i note your comments with particular UNK , as you may expect , given that i too am spanish .    3.8583021568198688
( the minutes were approved )    1.9577163372853157
resumption of the session    2.5077205603491106
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday , 21 january 2000 .    2.4731437536902603
madam president , allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the UNK tragedy .    4.043515889899829
two years ago , in UNK in italy , an american aeroplane from the UNK nato base cut through the UNK of a cable car during a low - flying exercise which exceeded safe limits , causing the deaths of more than 20 europeans .    3.7729194401709223
since then , the victims ' families , who have not had the UNK of justice , since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges , have been awaiting UNK financial compensation from the united states at the very least .    4.469105368348487
i therefore appeal to the president of this house and the president of the commission for them to stand UNK for immediate compensation from the u . s . authorities , and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims ' families .    4.2850547770412994
mrs angelilli , thank you . i have taken note of your comment .    3.6305496446008103
agenda    3.515252916915767
the next item is the order of business .    2.237602500005291
following a request to this effect , which i have received from a number of political groups , and following the meeting of the conference of presidents which has just been held , i propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance , pursuant to rule 50 of our rules of procedure , on the subject of the european union ' s reaction with regard to the talks in austria on forming a government .    3.8876920546344937
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda , it will be introduced by speeches from mr seixas da costa , president - in - office of the council , and mr romano prodi , president of the commission .    3.21752677783408
is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?    2.3237812159309805
madam president , i would like to express my support for the decision of the conference of presidents , and , since i publicly criticised the presidency in january , i would like to take this opportunity to say , both for myself and on behalf of the socialist group , that we now find the presidency ' s statements on this issue to be appropriate , and we agree on their basis , their importance and their form .    3.9814600903352404
madam president , it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with rule 50 of our rules of procedure .    3.576558310904513
this debate is topical , exceptionally important and urgent .    3.432601758531878
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it .    4.26006242286095
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal ?    2.3802624666883596
madam president , i shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which i consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the treaties , and with particular regard to article 7 of the treaty of amsterdam .    3.701430221803828
madam president , until now we believed that the european union was , according to the treaty of rome and the treaty of paris founding the european communities , and subsequently the union , an association of free , independent , sovereign states .    4.11361357551828
even though many developments cast doubt on this , we did believe , in spite of everything , that this was the case and , more recently , reference was made , albeit half - UNK , to the principle of subsidiarity .    4.587455442654389
well , patently , if we do open this debate today , madam president , as you are requesting and as the conference of presidents is requesting , on the basis of rule 50 , we shall then be opening up a UNK breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments , enabling some other majority in this parliament , at some future time , to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free , regular , peaceful and democratic elections within a member state .    3.9684269309234157
if you ratify .    2.9327709782089557
mr gollnisch , excuse me , you have one minute .    3.811168327037061
i know that you always take particular care to ensure that the rules of procedure are observed .    3.1680782637172706
madam president , i thought i had three minutes .    2.8775894862796028
do forgive me .    3.4769007496351607
if you ratify this development , then you are ratifying the development of the union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the member states , and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a union .    3.933598122569975
we have heard one speaker in favour and one against .    2.377235651972602
i shall now , therefore , put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote .    4.246390756379015
( parliament gave its assent )    2.0659013727593916
this debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business .    2.8922874630850655
topical and urgent debate    4.713500093893017
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .    1.7973816454680986
talks in austria on forming a government    3.4996518544109136
the next item is the debate on the talks in austria on forming a government .    2.0631386999686807
i shall immediately give the floor to mr seixas da costa , president - in - office of the council .    2.106971942737878
madam president , president of the commission , president - in - office of the council , the group of the party of european socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the european public .    2.9987284216529573
let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts .    3.906621892925937
firstly , we wish to express our total support for , and our solidarity with , the statement of the presidency - in - office of the council and the 14 member states , because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values , and not just the political force , which we have all built together .    4.462803137719352
in any event , these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party UNK known as the austrian freedom party .    3.006587851409535
the europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered , and the socialist group condemns the insults which have been directed at the president of the french republic and the belgian government , but also at the socialists , who are european citizens as well , because , at the moment , the austrian socialists are being described as UNK to their country .    4.542096284996091
i will say one thing . for many years i was a traitor to my country ; at least that was general franco ' s view .    3.4993584263514683
president guterres was also a traitor in UNK ' s eyes , and that is something that i believe should also be stated and defended by the ppe - de .    4.288651302505168
i also believe that the commission , or president prodi , has acted as a guardian of the treaties .    3.67299890294932
however , i would remind him that , during his inaugural debate , he described the commission as a european government .    3.843629222038321
a government must have more UNK and more courage .    3.927553275004491
that is what i am asking president prodi for at this moment .    3.444918893559732
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
with all due respect to a commissioner as effective as mr fischler , and given that we have heard contradictory comments , depending on the translation , with regard to a possible request by president prodi for the resignation of mr fischler , i would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this house .    4.081642800522051
secondly , madam president , we wish to send a very clear message to the austrian people .    4.393694763478493
this is an appeal to the majority of austrians who have not voted for haider , who have voted for the clearly democratic options , committed to europe , and i must point out that mr schüssel may have been minister for finance , but chancellor UNK also contributed to austria ' s integration process .    3.958623344603967
we should not be so politically partisan .    3.1315628771529265
the accession of austria to the community was a joint venture .    4.46216657736272
we all took part in it , not just one group .    4.146791733267781
therefore , madam president , i believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the austrians to reconsider and reflect , because this type of menace , which we have suffered before in europe , may not only harm austria , but it may also spread , and i say this bearing history in mind .    4.389029956578914
therefore , apart from the apology which mr schüssel has made , offering us all kinds of guarantees , as did UNK and UNK in UNK in munich , i would like to know whether the ppe intends to implement measures in relation to the austrian people ' s party , if it goes ahead with this mad project .    3.779276412317022
thirdly , if we do not stand up to this UNK alliance , i can assure you that we can forget the european union ' s main objective - enlargement - because , if we were UNK , UNK or UNK , what would we say , faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter ?    4.879633048685319
i therefore think that this is a great day for european politics to commence .    3.374317114101746
we support the council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option .    3.464626325081311
( applause from the pse group )    2.2339401374085748
madam president , we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the union , so that we can uphold them together .    4.0476296091040735
instead , we have been forced to debate the formal , substantial errors that have been made in the last few days .    3.794601429347418
we are UNK by the political naivety of people who , with UNK words , have UNK mr haider ' s position in austria and made the union look ridiculous , riding roughshod over article 7 of the treaty by announcing UNK measures .    3.777071553932831
we have never before seen such serious , UNK interference in the internal affairs of a member state .    2.5590974280510754
of course , we cannot violate the founding values of europe , and in this regard , the italian prime minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty : he mentioned the treaty of copenhagen , which i , like you , have never heard of because it does not exist .    4.283639030609518
maybe he was referring to the treaty of amsterdam , article 6 of which lists certain principles and article 7 certain procedures , in order to establish that a member state is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in article 6 .    3.8115077760988387
however , up UNK now , austria has committed no serious or persistent violation .    3.11663967587757
no political cohesion has so far come about , not even in the fight against organised crime , or in defence of the victims of genocide ; we do not have a currency that is even UNK stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty ; but it only took one minute of UNK fury to destroy the union ' s credibility .    3.6973452132295512
sanctions can be imposed after the treaties have been violated , but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government .    3.4753720568216435
otherwise , how will we deal with communist countries which return to communism : will we throw them out of the union too if communists enter into government , or will UNK ' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything ?    3.6459559737246505
bilateral relations involve the states , so the 14 do not come into this .    4.1102031611275205
this is riding roughshod over the european institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking , with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes . it is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions .    3.9941461267020717
so many things set us apart from mr haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely italian UNK UNK region .    3.4317240885156752
however , we already knew this .    3.177479169588348
however , today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the union seem to have turned their backs on the union ' s democratic role .    4.667112512038249
we support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples , and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the treaty or human rights .    3.986055017319201
we believe in europe , while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the union .    4.2527972132030545
this is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks .    2.7264178892406368
we have built a europe with an unstable market , not a europe with principles , rights and politics .    3.699133095858022
and these are the consequences !    4.818267782846751
therefore , we can but call on the commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the austrian people , thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples .    3.509473007245505
madam president , today we have an appointment with hypocrisy .    3.609698641108992
here we have a council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a state in the event of a serious and persistent breach .    3.192038836528077
in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in austria .    2.411112212814258
there are risks , as we are all aware , but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach .    3.5911084657057124
if we were to apply the criteria of articles 6 and 7 or the copenhagen criteria to the european union , then , most certainly , this european union could not become a member , although the countries of eastern europe are required to meet them .    4.420531479749185
and if we were to speak of serious and persistent UNK , then perhaps we could mention some member states , such as italy and france , first and third , respectively , in the list of countries condemned by the council of europe and the strasbourg court .    4.580935218158128
we could mention , my belgian friends , belgium and the dutroux case , the dozens upon dozens of children UNK , tortured , raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country , where inquiries are bogged down , making no headway .    2.9405666373358055
we could , if one third of the members of parliament so requested , require that the council and the commission look into the matter .    3.9809467945339523
we could ask ourselves why the austrians are rejecting 10 years , 13 years of party politics which has made one country - austria - corrupt and UNK , just as it is now UNK countries such as italy , belgium and other european union member states .    3.638048355667193
we might well wonder why 76 % of belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56 % of french citizens have no confidence in their country ' s system of justice , and 53 % of italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in italian justice .    3.4025780471371387
madame president , my group , the edd , and especially my party , are very concerned by this debate .    4.0691029125074305
we cannot , and we do not , support in any way the sentiments and politics of herr haider and we deplore his references to the third reich .    3.7382626696667423
we also , however , deplore the fact that your parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country , especially one which is part of the european union .    3.956042479160444
my party at home are certainly not UNK , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the european union very well .    4.858174561699275
are you going to interfere with great britain ' s parliament if we are elected ?    3.401634020184126
madame president , the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament .    4.004736889199196
i believe they gave him 28 % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government .    4.08328697000557
your parliament , may i suggest , madame president , should wait to see if the party of haider has an effect on the policies of that country .    4.050609873868983
then , and only then , might you consider if human rights are affected .    3.6615220593979942
your parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then , madame president and only then , may your parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the european union .    3.374384537207085
madam president , as a representative of the freedom party , i respect the concerns some of my fellow meps have with regard to the democratic developments in austria .    3.795845335973766
my reaction may come as a surprise when i say that i personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards austria in matters of respect for human rights , having a sense of responsibility for one ' s own past , and the stability of democracy .    4.318709858454722
austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it , rightly or wrongly .    3.576083490072445
the refusal of our government , down through the years , to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the second world war , together with their refusal to properly compensate the UNK victims and those forced into hard labour , have done a great deal to bolster this negative image .    3.135107917086962
this fpö has now entered into a coalition with the övp , due to the outcome of elections held on 3 october 1999 , when the previous government was voted out of office .    3.5289588898049358
this is the citizen of a state ' s prerogative , for it is the founding principle of a democracy .    3.8648434352810215
when the talks between the spö and övp broke down , the socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the fpö for their support .    3.2718009386834788
we were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here !    3.0003547409398164
when we suddenly refused this offer , an inflammatory and UNK - UNK propaganda campaign began that is beyond our UNK to this day .    3.326120978937327
the fpö party is established in austria ' s political landscape .    4.215333133188554
the head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other UNK governments .    4.817096603531804
what many austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind , and why the campaign did not begin until the freedom party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the spö ?    3.3335750821893866
there is prejudice at work here , which - without going into our programme - is reducing the UNK hour of european history to a political UNK .    3.4857943750329774
i am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get UNK out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas UNK of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda , as , for example , the italian mep bertinotti did yesterday on italian tv when he accused mr haider of denying the holocaust .    3.3725373801749465
shame on you mr bertinotti !    3.7920342153996383
you might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda .    3.656051936353948
denouncing a democratically elected politician as a nazi does not make you an anti - fascist !    3.3905979223065152
on the contrary , you are UNK the true victims of national socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did .    3.020676039676808
your behaviour stems from your own prejudices , you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose .    3.696817903490496
the attacks against austria ' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a member state are an insult to the austrian people .    3.7661245142888977
the new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy , the rights of the opposition , commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour .    3.1415806002536604
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
madam president , to begin with , i would like to make one thing abundantly clear : austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one - party system or of a totalitarian system of right - wing persuasion .    3.447271360345098
austria is a stable democracy ; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary .    3.325324508509074
austria is a UNK country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there .    3.6871044467737577
there is nothing unusual about what is happening in austria : there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections , in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found .    3.3340728142325085
there will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition .    3.3484327741121582
the austrian people ' s party , which i represent here in this parliament , used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the eu and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the european union , and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement .    4.147739428103915
we respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our member states as to the way ahead for austria .    4.20328804470423
our understanding UNK from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present .    4.083261300953599
our country was not just the first victim of the hitler dictatorship , many people were perpetrators too , although i refute any suggestion of collective guilt .    3.5302757469212254
the övp played no small part in helping austria find its way into the european union .    2.907689152613423
my country ' s place is not outside the european union but in it .    4.441847563388185
. , with all the rights and commitments that this entails !    4.6510695634130945
any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto , and not according to the UNK put about both by political UNK and the international media .    4.615203298331395
a declared belief in human rights , democracy and the rule of law , in an honest UNK of austria ' s role in the past , in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century , the holocaust , will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the övp and fpö .    3.590780749523332
my party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of european politics and continues to be rooted in the european community of values !    4.088231475576659
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
madam president , mr president - in - office of the council , representatives of the commission , it is a black day for austria and for europe .    3.3399120328640435
not even mr UNK ' s web of lies or mrs stenzel ' s words of UNK can do anything to change that .    3.779734741683062
for the day has UNK : two irresponsible politicians , consumed with a UNK for power , are selling austria ' s image , political role , and to some extent even its economic interests , down the river !    3.8260271022337298
( applause , heckling )    3.2945780554386483
they are trading this in for a head of government ' s position and for membership of a government .    3.796669101871494
they are just as prepared to take on board the fact that austria will go from being a UNK country to a UNK one , as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens .    4.114040796995119
i believe - as do many who for years have campaigned against haider and his brand of politics , and especially my colleagues in the social democratic delegation in this chamber - that the various measures announced by the international community , insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives , are grave and also inappropriate .    3.8075122966118085
however , my criticism - and i freely admit this - my UNK , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , messrs schüssel and haider and their parties , .    3.5439881028563067
. and that includes their representatives in this parliament .    4.228533824011402
mr poettering , it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as i am , albeit for different reasons , for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions .    3.93163317412612
you are having to defend a certain mr schüssel , you are having to UNK with schüssel as he is today and who , as i understand it , was recently told not to come to the representatives of the christian democratic party ' s summit meeting .    3.8231210080066407
the argument that mr poettering himself used has come into play , i . e . that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his UNK if he were to be integrated into the political system .    4.163971755549251
however , in my view , he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this , into our political system , and into the europe of today , than any other extreme right - wing movement .    3.61842889425774
anyone who feeds on prejudice towards UNK and ethnic minorities and gives UNK to these prejudices , whose programme features UNK and anti - liberalism , who displays UNK behaviour and arrogance in their international relations , and who has never yet UNK themselves clearly and unequivocally from national socialism , has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate !    2.9800988474588967
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
this historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the conservatives for having UNK with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be UNK .    3.3624953346708497
that is how the wolf - albeit on account of the self - sacrifice of the övp - is sustained rather than kept in check .    3.0653424013049655
i understand that europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government .    3.976568837337735
however , by the same token , there is another austria , the one where UNK thousand people demonstrated against the fpö having any involvement in government , and who will continue to demonstrate against this government .    4.244635465695216
i urge you to support this europe and to support and help this austria !    3.7216562610043447
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
the more powerful this europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the europe of today , the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right - wing extremism .    3.4125887285127945
for europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and UNK , or even against a UNK into barbarism .    3.9957795790487203
please support the austrian people against this government !    4.018192347646269
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
madam president , this is an historic moment , as it is now , at last , quite clear to us all that the european union has gradually developed into a community of values .    4.049257290068599
we see this , now that the government of one member state is being joined by a party which , as is known , does not respect all these values .    4.249579946725211
as members of parliament , we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever .    4.146552592086006
it is more important than ever that respect for , and non - violation of , human values and the rights of minorities , including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the european union , form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the eu , and , for this reason , the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding .    4.37373544641394
it must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration .    3.5130242047807716
as important is the fact that austria ' s forces of democracy should be given support , as none of us wishes to isolate the country .    4.258692775328061
we know that most austrians respect these values .    2.861765721957836
they have also shown how they feel : not all the demonstrations have taken place outside austria .    3.2711702810011856
doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in austrian policy for a long time .    3.7286202918395075
i believe parliament should support these forces of democracy .    3.1049925989657132
i also appeal to the austrian president , that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces .    3.825088040473289
madam president , i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , francis wurtz , reminded us of just now .    3.5097878874160435
the fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because , as you know , we essentially disagree with the policies made by europe , with its economic and social policies , its democratic deficit and the member states ' involvement in the terrible war in the balkans .    4.135077891015418
our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today : this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational , neo - nazi element in europe is extraordinary .    3.1524257213408666
this danger does not concern austria , it concerns europe .    3.1442273391429056
we are talking about us , not austria .    3.1088983441552145
we know the social causes which contribute , along with unemployment and instability , to UNK tendencies towards this ; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia , racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right - wing groups to settle accounts with nazism , we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an UNK mixture being created in europe .    3.5718309357514975
not only the UNK region , but all our countries are involved : the conditions are being created whereby democracy and european civilisation may once again come under threat .    3.3536901114530018
the position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation .    4.442600997025667
europe is showing that it has not forgotten UNK ; europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past .    3.3643844727765644
now , though , it should follow through with its actions , and the first to follow through should be the commission , which , however , has been obscure and weak on this , making the value of the presidency ' s position even more apparent .    5.790203479093877
this is the change we must impose on the commission ' s action .    3.6302806633684472
madam president , despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples , which opposes fascism , nazism or communism , both new and old , and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the austrian people , we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by parliament .    3.66902978021201
in the manifesto of the austrian democratic freedom party , there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , fundamental freedoms or the rule of law , enshrined in article 6 of the treaties .    3.8128601997738016
i would , however , like to draw your attention to the fact that the president - in - office , who has been so critical of austria , has recently consigned the inhabitants of UNK to the sovereign rule of the people ' s democratic republic of china .    3.7431260594435414
perhaps , in order to strengthen the union ' s democracy , it would now be appropriate to isolate austria and criminalise a party that was democratically elected by the austrian citizens , while bringing turkey and its " grey UNK " into europe .    4.01725292424829
madam president , we are debating an extremely serious issue .    3.6004037371696116
we are debating nothing less than the presence in a member state ' s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the UNK and moral bases of the union enshrined in its founding treaties .    4.0573974949002904
a simple reading of chapter 4 , article 1 of the austrian freedom party ' s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience UNK .    3.367082734235879
the view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others , as is written here , UNK old UNK of the century which we have just left behind , which some UNK have described as the century of horrors ; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind mr haider ' s manifesto has stirred up once again , to our UNK .    3.763206785389368
of course austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non - interference in the internal affairs of a member state .    3.189733698109669
however , that is not the problem .    4.3409543867878195
the question is whether the union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a member state which includes such a party .    3.1880219042014346
our answer to this crucial question is no .    3.538831393257941
leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations , leaving aside possible UNK based on other people ' s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests , the spanish delegation of the people ' s group of this parliament , in full agreement with the spanish people ' s party and the spanish government , clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 january by the portuguese presidency of the council .    3.7791902218677884
we agree with its substance , its tone and its scope .    3.034771691091231
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
UNK UNK once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the UNK way to UNK a tiger was to allow it to devour you .    3.9491375737654657
history is a compendium of events which could have been avoided .    3.185511390330949
therefore , madam president , the union and the assembly must send an unequivocal message , rejecting of the tiger of intolerance , xenophobia and totalitarianism , so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of UNK , UNK and UNK which mark europe ' s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price .    3.760255408516863
( loud applause )    2.3309633389222304
madam president , the european union was built upon the idea ' never again ' , meaning never again do we want to see xenophobia , concentration camps , anti - semitism , heightened nationalism or war .    3.1299356078507956
the one and only significance of the european union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de UNK to any ideal of UNK within the heart of europe , and which is still highly topical today .    3.8386693099877793
it is not true to say that , when a government forms an alliance with neo - fascists somewhere in europe , this is merely a question of national sovereignty .    4.341475987812328
for this union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances .    3.47835212126859
it is a community that is UNK to exist , in which , when the main thing is under threat , when values are under threat , all democrats must UNK over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again .    4.1597744403373325
in the thirties , when adolf hitler was democratically elected , although with a minority , many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and , mr poettering , in france , a number of men and women , on the right wing but perhaps of other political UNK too , thought , ' better hitler in france than the front UNK . '    3.8841965920423003
they put their own petty UNK first , and the rest is history .    4.06961690331062
we must make a rapid , strong and united response .    2.9831963658526863
i would have liked to hear your discussion with the austrian president , mr poettering . we are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance .    3.748586963318932
so our response must be rapid and strong .    2.796862787277982
of course , the treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable ; i was almost going to say ' irreparable ' .    3.1603827867584386
history has taught us that fascists start to blow hot and cold : using heated words first , in populist , xenophobic speeches , and then UNK words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to UNK them gradually , poisoning them , until the day they start to take action .    3.4197842186304532
and when that day comes , it is too late .    3.6975551303908167
so our treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late , but we are not at that point : today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point .    4.8037497289501605
we must therefore find a political solution .    2.9078831044571065
i support the council proposals in this , while deploring a certain lack of strength , a certain spinelessness , on the part of the commission which will , however , have to be vigilant on a day - by - day basis , with determination over time , since fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy , they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end .    3.910148568463509
our response must be rapid .    2.8018196641696385
if today we do not staunchly support the council , then history will judge us , saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the munich agreement .    4.120918194179614
madam president , i am pleased about the fact that , in austria , the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes , in my eyes , a huge victory for democracy .    4.209634539232009
let there be no doubt about it : we decline with thanks a europe which develops into a kind of " big brother " and which keeps watch over left - wing political correctness in one member state or another in a stalinist way and using stalinist methods .    3.290225509898423
european democracy and austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a belgian government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party , which was condemned by the court , to the post of european commissioner .    3.997997445345473
today , we thank the austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech .    3.648684139931742
madam president , this debate was opened by mr da costa , who merely confirms that the eu presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the member states .    3.6861671104958322
this debate , and the background to it , reinforced the point that the council , the commission and this parliament itself are dominated by socialists .    5.0437399278293595
my delegation of 37 conservative and UNK members from the united kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy , programme and tone of austria ' s freedom party .    3.3068039329178527
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history , in particular world war ii , but also its policies on enlargement , on immigration , on race and its attitude to the european union itself .    3.9792478023776003
we were also outraged , however , at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny , the terror and the excesses of the former ussr .    3.949876468143545
even today , surely it is high time for the party of european socialists to break their UNK links with china ' s communist party .    3.2691648282273005
not a word was said by these same eu governments about coalition governments involving fellow - travelling communists in french or italian governments , or in german state governments , or even the british government ' s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in northern ireland today .    3.189877855580737
this , madam president , is the hypocrisy of the left .    3.91152412306414
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards , especially of the british government and the other largely socialist heads of eu governments and include that of the united states .    3.6266246922357572
we should recognise , however , that the democratic process sometimes produces UNK results .    3.8375144716881273
this requires action to address the underlying causes , including an examination of the electoral process itself .    3.4010929709676927
that should be our task , not political UNK .    3.632662618634481
madam president , representative of the council , commissioner , a week ago , the big international holocaust conference ended in stockholm .    3.635445107284332
its aim was to combat the UNK and the evil in today ' s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo - nazism .    3.7890371970753214
it would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite , at this time , into the institutions of the eu , a xenophobic party which UNK with nazi ideas .    4.3004243483256115
secondly , i want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations .    4.086776345091557
we demand of the candidate states and of the countries with which the eu cooperates under the lomé agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours .    4.589927924208406
we must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned .    3.7974712133393735
that is why we are reacting against this carry - on in austria .    2.678220759526279
it is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened .    3.130331601140464
we are at a watershed in the history of the european union .    2.8996768699091695
the union is not only an economic community but also a community of values , something which we take seriously . something has happened .    3.7141390746176723
the european union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its UNK .    3.720163184448026
madam president , as everyone has said , this is a very important day . it is the day of the first debate of european political life .    4.769509597768225
and this is not pure chance .    3.988792853125248
i feel that today ' s meeting is not a meeting of europe , our institutions , with austria or mr haider ' s party .    4.666004391875967
it is the meeting of europe with itself , with its raison d ' être , with the reasons why we are here in this chamber .    4.210349454604494
this chamber was not made for goods , it was not made for money .    3.8947384459034846
this chamber , and the european institutions , were build to uphold values , morality and a certain spirit .    4.33654645076425
in the twentieth century , we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk , and morality , values and the spirit which i mentioned can be UNK affected by UNK which have just one name : nationalist glorification , populism and the concept of racial superiority .    3.9173655380720027
the fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of mr haider ' s party , the fpö , to find nationalist glorification , populism and racial superiority in every chapter .    3.1496458336392164
reading only one sentence which my friend , mr vidal - quadras , has previously mentioned , " the nation is defined by its location , culture and race , locally , ethnically and culturally . "    2.9459596719429415
well , we cannot accept such statements .    3.527336675214588
if europe has any meaning , and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if christian democracy has any meaning , if the history of christian democracy has any meaning , then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and , whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same UNK up again , must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation .    3.4448950379827643
this is the reason why i feel that the european parliament , which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the council or the commission , must pay tribute to those people in the various states and european institutions who had the courage to say no , and it must say , madam president , that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit , and in clear terms declare , without UNK , its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in austria , UNK the statement made on the day of the munich agreement by a great french christian democrat who said that , if you are going to have to say no , then the best time to do so is right at the beginning .    4.574254135977858
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
madam president , we the belgian christian democrats are concerned as , fortunately , are a great many other members too .    3.3729301021246716
the coalition which is being created in one of the member states is clearly an austrian affair but undoubtedly has a european dimension too .    4.219819323377101
because what is it that unites us in europe ? surely it is the values and principles of freedom , democracy and respect for human rights , more than anything .    4.118455175455585
the austrian freedom party leader , mr haider , has repeatedly UNK these values .    3.1923864961204216
he also UNK the basic forms of diplomatic UNK .    3.528942448284903
he is a dangerous man .    3.3557512736605872
the christian democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme - right voters but never to negotiate with extreme - right leaders .    3.47665732368217
values should take precedence over power .    3.7159296647584594
we deplore , therefore , what is happening in austria .    3.836414445915941
in fact , we were shaken by it .    3.0454602337959895
we are extremely disappointed .    2.9781626523216493
as a last resort , we would ask the övp to look into alternatives .    3.990438148015882
we keep reminding them about article 6 of the treaty .    2.928132028992999
we continue to fight against the UNK of the extreme right .    3.9826537803166886
if , despite this , the coalition goes ahead , we would urge the övp party members to ensure that the principles and values which UNK european integration are observed in political programmes , both in word and deed .    3.8353969253300475
madam president , austria awaits a heavy responsibility .    2.908267833972472
madam president , it is clear that we in this parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting mr haider and his politics , but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics .    3.834670146705819
have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the council presidency last weekend are having in austria itself ?    3.6545767290288094
have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation UNK from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here ?    3.548903071738709
have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow mep was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in austria in the course of the next few days ?    3.5529659679180936
from all accounts , this would only serve to strengthen haider .    3.7273888111510183
is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics ?    3.0312843512662715
europe is a community of law .    3.9408944471004825
democracy , respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold .    3.7629241999133
one of the UNK of democracy is that we should not UNK of electoral outcomes but respect them , and that is why we must respect the fact that the austrians , by virtue of their political culture , voted as they did .    4.404250098878883
it is for reasons of UNK that the president - in - office of the council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the treaty .    3.92413242877631
it would be politically UNK not to isolate the övp but to support it as an undeniably democratic , constitutional and well - known european party , so as to be equally certain that austria will continue to be a member of this european community , and that is why we must give the övp our support in this difficult situation , and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take !    4.003717700087254
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
madam president , they say , where i come from , ' it ' s three times for a UNK ' , and three times , as i think you will discover in the course of that debate , i UNK my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent , and on several occasions , a moving debate .    4.097496100413752
first of all , could i express my thanks on behalf of president prodi and my colleagues in the commission for the support and understanding offered by several members of the house to the position taken by the commission in the statement that we made yesterday .    4.230626233598466
i must respond also to the fact , of course , that there were references during the debate - and i use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity , the complacency and the fragility of the commission ' s opinion .    5.054043282299715
i am duty - bound to say to this house , there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered , or indeed the action taken , by the commission on this issue .    4.188085341528862
we made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement , as did the president this afternoon , to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen member states in their statement on monday .    4.17225363209341
secondly , we said , in very specific terms , that we will work closely with all member states in examining the situation as it develops in austria .    4.1858921834879705
thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of article 6 of the treaty ; and that we will take our part under article 7 of the treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld .    4.006075494837237
there is no complacency , no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all .    3.0920817594063488
and , when i say that the commission took that view , i include my dear colleague franz fischler , who is from austria ; and who , once again , demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a member of the european commission , under UNK , in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning .    3.969804537113951
anyone , therefore , who invites franz fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is austrian , should examine their own motives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily UNK by references to xenophobia and even more UNK UNK in this world .    4.03441892908298
i say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague , franz fischler .    2.9637940337948385
could i also say , madam president , that the understanding of the presidency , the portuguese presidency , for our position , was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by mr da costa when he said , and i quote him , that ' portugal and the other member states want to ensure that the working of the community machine is not affected by the current situation ' .    4.810149671205547
that surely is in everyone ' s interests .    3.4324271736590806
in order to ensure that the treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the community machine , we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday .    4.394012875617329
we will continue to do that , madam president , without fear or favour .    3.4794168353007207
that is our duty .    3.3118397336821945
it is also a matter of conviction .    3.7238453697419467
my final point is this .    3.0546576853331997
there are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with herr haider ' s offensive statements , the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of UNK aggressive statements with apologies , sometimes on successive days .    3.2800263605281987
we understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of nazism .    3.8482677921870785
and , when we recall that , like many others on all sides of this house , my and my colleagues ' UNK are naturally aroused .    4.173096441009532
however , the commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct .    4.435457642079849
and that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning .    3.534273258216033
that is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law . without fragility , without complacency , without ambiguity , but in the service of the whole union and every member state of the union and its people .    3.9128015454507987
we will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as mr cox said in the debate , ' necessarily with acute vigilance ' .    3.449893981622867
i wonder , since mr da costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the chamber , whether mr kinnock could confirm that the commission supports the view explicitly stated by mr da costa today and in the recent statement by the presidency on behalf of the heads of government .    3.938625357923695
does the commission support the council ?    3.5179915987590347
madam president , when the commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen member states and shares the concern that gave rise to that view , i think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning , as soon as the commission could discuss the issue , it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the member states .    4.191871133873933
thank you , commissioner kinnock .    2.3826507168743456
i think that we have just had a great political debate , equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it .    4.138634818317882
thank you , ladies and gentlemen .    3.1240163795170353
the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed .    2.420222045789449
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.7835196827501634
recourse to the precautionary principle    5.260775929476386
the next item is the commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle .    2.205151317576595
i want to start by saying that i am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle , and it has been written together with david byrne and erkki liikanen .    3.333170977874597
the precautionary principle is not a new concept .    4.012828094712383
it has been used by the community for some time now in a range of policy areas , environmental , human , animal and plant health ; and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the ec treaty since maastricht .    3.9233547308133088
it also appears in a range of international texts , for example , the rio declaration and most recently the bio - safety protocol .    3.3656764073389636
the essence of the precautionary principle is clear .    3.897845329485714
it involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear , but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action .    3.6045896835867883
however , the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years .    3.346358308495136
events such as the bse and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary .    3.497572960279076
in view of this growing interest , the commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle .    4.227641142287452
the basic aim of the communication is twofold .    3.6404860663523713
to explain in a clear and coherent way how the commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles .    3.1985656139185448
we also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to UNK fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism .    3.8327733937046573
the commission ' s starting point in applying the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental , human , animal and plant health .    3.337606208374578
of course , this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures , but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear .    3.564626747203966
as such , while the precautionary principle does not involve the UNK of science , as some have alleged , it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics .    4.169384785147443
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision - makers are prepared to accept for society .    4.0599147019374575
it is therefore political by nature .    2.833030754206814
however , the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper .    3.691551290236859
measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection - that is , we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut .    3.6120035940873465
they must be non - discriminatory in their application , that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin .    3.721612063214229
and they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .    3.9337158939177455
for example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved .    3.4693093584047525
measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action ; that is , the measures should be cost - effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment , that is the burden of proof .    3.92047249219468
all these elements have to apply UNK .    3.3641407125259173
applying the precautionary principle does not , therefore , automatically imply a ban .    4.194302164043458
this communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue ; however , it is the first time that the commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use .    4.636246098589655
by setting out in some detail how the commission applies , and intends to apply , the precautionary principle , we hope to be able to clarify the situation at community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at european and international level .    3.4758967513074435
mr president , commissioner , thank you very much for your statement .    2.517026464369487
i have three short questions , the first being as follows .    3.6482905351703128
we have been awaiting a common communication from the commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the commission speaks with one voice .    4.263067956596812
does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the commissioners for industry , foreign trade , competition and the internal market ?    3.5593488083913534
i am sure that your answer to this will be " yes " but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ?    3.956691573702757
my next question , mrs wallström , is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation ; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors , for example ?    3.9151074372462626
lastly , will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation ?    3.8332401962428246
in other words , will each proposal contain an additional UNK stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached ?    3.525997020501271
of course , this is shared by the whole commission .    3.7890854746855887
it received strong support from the rest of the commissioners and it has been through an UNK consultation in the whole of the commission .    3.953523024135538
so we have really worked through this document and i am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document .    3.8595475878379415
yes , i would say we already use this way of working with different , difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example .    3.8142846874812957
and , i am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle .    4.051951088095493
we have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban UNK in soft pvc toys ; and of course , we apply it in several different environmental areas .    3.4253951066927604
it has been mainly used in the environmental field , but , of course also when it comes to human health .    4.288202441730519
so , we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it .    3.9086790650359253
mr president , commissioner , regarding the relationship between science , on the one hand , and applying the precautionary principle on the other , the communication states that UNK that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence .    3.81975905730299
needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .    3.1863307061268413
we might ask ourselves , what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for ?    3.2502110697173707
the communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied , provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists .    4.2784858814074305
i would like to ask , what is , then , the definition of a recognised minority ?    3.7247155384087733
how would you describe this ?    3.5204806475885255
what establishes a recognised minority ?    3.1002857986492276
if a political decision is involved , i would also like to ask : who takes this political decision ?    4.1227264959557575
the commission ?    3.2904863227565877
the council ?    3.2785520543882587
what , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?    5.358689726055232
finally , will this whole decision - making process be carried out in a transparent , public way ?    3.4514140678750644
these are my three questions .    3.0859159388023367
. yes , mr president , that is true .    6.412835147423915
there were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear , but i will try to answer some questions .    3.960081213288908
who will take the decision , who are the decision - makers ?    5.441075203030735
well , that depends on who the legislators are .    3.170958573212554
this is part of risk management .    3.6306433823652218
they have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case .    4.882371916900955
however , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .    4.024404073503079
it can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete .    3.2718501391120345
it is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done , but there is no question of changing the scientific base .    3.5477856677530752
we use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision ; and that should also be done in the future .    4.152361319887251
you have to see this as a tool for risk management .    3.87794942455508
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger , for example , or if you want to protect the environment ; and you have to look at the science that is available .    4.467155320267897
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science .    3.247622055204544
then you decide to take a measure or not , to take action or not .    4.74300841598447
so , there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today .    4.0058616714522515
mr president , i have a question concerning an actual , concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle .    3.346742886656207
it is a fact that these substances are now being discovered . there are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment .    3.5185912928351883
there are many people who maintain that they entail major risks , while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are .    3.1334743460221426
recently , both sweden and denmark urged the commission in the council of ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants .    3.7597525313399363
i am wondering , therefore , if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative .    4.488064606376096
. ( sv ) mr president , thank you very much , mr sjöstedt , for this question .    3.254323511658233
the issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one .    3.096556420545698
it was raised quite recently in the environment council by a number of ministers who want the commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done .    4.344898017914103
we are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do .    3.76633456080148
allow me to remind you , however , that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban .    3.6698586158915574
there may be a series of different measures which can be taken .    3.741104426167599
it ought not , therefore , to be immediately interpreted as a ban .    3.770981351730392
where brominated flame retardants are concerned , there may eventually be a ban , but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken .    3.876230531586141
this issue is extremely topical .    3.135628105916613
the commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done .    3.381070010962416
you said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier .    3.784308952251526
is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the atlantic ocean ?    3.923040457647427
i think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone - treated beef and genetically modified crops .    3.007753354377566
will the americans take the same view of this point as we do ?    4.264034348918133
. ( sv ) mr president , i am pleased to be able to tell you that , in montreal , we have just signed a protocol concerning bio - safety .    3.575949963467619
we succeeded there in agreeing , at an international forum , as to the definition of the precautionary principle .    3.7249896060779846
i consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol .    3.2383156206123256
i believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle .    2.9953427688223404
it is , moreover , also accepted as an important and effective tool .    3.64544025930417
mr president , i have two questions . i shall try to be very brief indeed .    3.035016845535685
the first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle .    3.358735810361147
as i have understood it , there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood .    4.217191918240135
is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out , including a cost - benefit analysis ?    3.185116671899499
in that case , i am rather concerned , because the idea was really that a cost - benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced . instead , the precautionary principle should come first .    3.827462947609493
my second question concerns the burden of proof .    2.3123497722217796
i remember margot wallström being introduced as commissioner in the committee .    3.1647808068606684
at that time , she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof .    2.9223899068356594
in other words , a product ' s manufacturer is to demonstrate whether or not the product is hazardous .    3.027220647740194
i want to know whether this also applies in the document which the commission has presented now .    4.0856413035897825
. ( sv ) thank you , mrs UNK .    2.947117989599039
these are two important questions , and it is good that i should be given the opportunity to clarify them .    3.889760114173021
no , one must not begin by carrying out a cost - benefit analysis . instead , the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know , of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals .    3.9320855971879243
when , on the other hand , the decision has been made to take a certain measure , the one chosen ought to be cost - effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness .    4.074268170623745
it is not , therefore , the case that one must begin with a cost - benefit analysis .    3.1269115427821936
the second question concerns the reversed burden of proof .    2.5272536438593525
it is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases .    3.910435154613519
i have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this .    3.869237582533585
there , however , we are concerned with that particular area , whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern .    4.232244409706506
therefore , the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context . instead , it is a question of political decision - making and of the bases for this .    3.9593760708916266
it is , however , perfectly correct that , when it comes , for example , to chemicals , we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof .    3.863358773547804
mr president , i believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work , otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible .    4.24522864870961
i will give an example : a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind . it is therefore a UNK substance .    3.257752228035812
very well , it is a fungicide , it UNK off mould .    4.87735103336257
this UNK has been demonstrated by just one english laboratory , perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests .    3.822035790727957
now , in my opinion , given that this is such a serious risk to health , the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market , which new zealand has done , for example .    4.065316188186791
so i want to put this question to you . when human health is at stake , or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected , should we not perhaps carry out a cost - benefit analysis ?    3.737699284439354
the cost of a baby being born blind is too high ; there are no benefits that can compensate for this .    3.4666287038929484
in short , commissioner , i would therefore like to know whether in this case , the precautionary principle as you understand it , would in any case , require the product to be taken off the market , until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary .    3.849968810552434
. ( sv ) mr president , no one wants more than i do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people ' s health and the environment .    3.981835231072326
obviously , i cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here , but i shall go directly back and see what i can obtain in the way of information about this particular case .    4.326197446000581
the truth , of course , is that a great many member states , and no doubt other nations too , have taken measures to protect their populations ' health which amount to using the precautionary principle , even if it has not always been called that .    4.355578818434909
naturally , it is not in the first place a question of cost ; there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided .    4.595989241150464
nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure .    3.508169010159761
i think , however , it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken , it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between .    4.371820231313423
in those circumstances , consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result .    3.505491387569019
i cannot UNK telling you about an occasion when the expression cost - effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it , namely when i was on a visit to africa .    3.2047182285830282
at a UNK for aids patients , i met two irish catholic UNK who were UNK for dying aids patients .    3.2472853078423465
they were the first to say that , each day , they must think about doing what is most cost - effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there . we must be very careful about how we use resources .    3.896311240773605
i believe we can learn something from this .    3.1487765720152923
we must , of course , always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help .    3.92702180994265
as is also explained in the present communication , it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost - benefit analysis .    3.897138556973251
consideration should be given to what science is offering in the way of knowledge , and this should be used as an important political tool for protecting the environment and people ' s health .    4.431616709505361
mr president , it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions !    3.7393381916410484
commissioner , i would like to come back again to my first question , when i asked about the other commissioners , for it may have sounded as though i was in UNK .    4.38994091716748
indeed you responded in kind , as i knew you would do .    4.136663892012601
i would like to draw your attention to something mr goodwill asked , that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the european union .    3.0900466503049384
i have good reason for asking this .    3.3206255303612133
as you rightly said , the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where , as yet , there is no scientific evidence .    4.432724918208774
how can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time , for example by our partners in the usa , on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes ?    3.9013957675607487
how can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy , will not , as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors , keep pulling the carpet from UNK you ?    3.843146891655157
that is exactly what it is all about , otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here , commissioner !    4.11294154333767
mr president , i think it is extremely important to point to the present communication ' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of UNK UNK to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons .    4.039225163510977
we should not be so naïve as to think otherwise .    3.07884764206758
ever since we signed this protocol in montreal , we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment , health and trade .    3.2992807721633657
this constitutes a good example , therefore .    3.7223764371615493
we should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too , but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily .    4.883980342047917
we now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle , and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it , something which is clearly established in the present communication .    4.019063929775773
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed , so to speak , as more than an ordinary aspect of administration , even though , as we have been able to establish from the interventions , questions and replies , it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance .    3.916006559811174
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
intergovernmental conference    4.48056333079341
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0018 / 2000 ) by mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the convening of the intergovernmental conference [ 14094 / 1999 - c5 - 0341 / 1999 - 1999 / 0825 ( cns ) ] .    2.1172950091325884
mr president , i will begin by thanking the portuguese presidency and the commission for all our recent very useful contacts .    3.556325701918379
let me also once more thank my co - rapporteur mr leinen for our excellent collaboration .    2.7888253472093254
the intergovernmental conference that is about to begin is important , both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement .    4.392442353808795
the work of the conference will determine the structure and method based on which europe will be functioning in the twentieth century .    3.411315802102386
for the european union of the future to be able to function more effectively , more democratically and with complete transparency , clearly what we need is an extensive and in - depth reform of the institutions and the way they work .    4.1939771093689915
the first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the intergovernmental conference is to begin its work .    3.635435909530596
from the decisions made at the helsinki summit , it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional europe , one that is more effective , more democratic and more transparent .    3.4715142348198915
this is because the helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the european union ' s institutional bodies .    3.6924553605610257
i will not repeat which ones , because everyone knows .    3.150344930972465
my conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very UNK demands of the peoples of europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the european union is already involved , namely enlargement .    4.185270257230089
granted this , the new intergovernmental conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which , properly addressed , would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the european union ' s institutions .    3.8872973953931895
just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which , for that very reason , are highly visible to the european public .    3.9813499002005144
in its numerous debates and its reports so far the european parliament has openly supported the convening of the intergovernmental conference .    3.2025371289085616
at the same time , however , i am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform , i repeat , of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the european public such as health , energy , culture , transport and even tourism .    4.2509586591172015
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point i would like to UNK the political conduct of the portuguese presidency , which has repeatedly made a commitment to the european parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end .    4.668786259761745
all the same , whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every member state to the intergovernmental conference .    3.4684730216723696
this is because the institutional framework within which europe will operate in the future is a foundation of european integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the union ' s member states .    4.1386674750112915
the same applies to the commission and i would again like to thank commissioner barnier for his collaboration with the european parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us .    4.407438422080477
mr president , the group of the european people ' s party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the european council in helsinki .    2.9520458114372388
it seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the union ' s institutions .    3.868006719074452
in helsinki , the governments approved the idea that , as long as the european union consists of fewer than 21 states , a minimal reform would be sufficient . with more than 21 , a deeper reform would become necessary .    4.191085834405578
the european council in helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new member states .    2.6214602602573036
it is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .    2.704293226929783
we are therefore thinking in terms of the treaty and we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow for a deeper reform of the union .    4.539825098301598
having said this , mr president , this parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the conference .    4.229978299606342
in theory , we could have done so .    3.7545751941869034
we could have voted on the UNK of this month and the conference would not have been able to start on the UNK .    4.154322712285834
however , we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement .    4.467689974517463
mr president , i am very happy to be able to say this to the portuguese presidency because it has earned great respect in this assembly .    3.60270207823518
the portuguese presidency shares many of this parliament ' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the intergovernmental conference is widened to include other essential issues .    3.671855426827663
mr president , i would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the european parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the european parliament itself .    3.4354249624810955
however , the european parliament will be reinforced politically by the treaty resulting from this intergovernmental conference . this is for one very simple reason : according to the agreements made in helsinki , this intergovernmental conference will lead to issues , which are currently decided unanimously , being decided by a qualified majority .    4.085217348147801
therefore , the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase .    3.4903437730613907
it is already established within the community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with parliament .    3.074310301169209
therefore , since the qualified majority will be extended , there will also be more codecision with parliament .    3.8750876162234196
however , this parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational european institution if it did not consider the political design of the union .    2.957971327778634
that it is what we are doing .    4.121610902969787
we believe that , in the political design of the union , other issues need to be dealt with .    4.625569283040945
these include , amongst others , the incorporation into the treaty of security and defence issues , which have made much progress recently , but which must be incorporated into the treaty .    4.379141252676945
of course there is also the charter of fundamental rights , and work began on its wording yesterday , which i believe has started very positively .    3.6525210950658256
we are going to work seriously to ensure that the europeans come to see being european as an advantage and that european citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the union ' s institutions .    3.489868825244633
therefore , mr president , our proposals , which we will specify in another report , together with the proposals of the commission , which has produced an excellent document - and i am happy to be able to say this here to mr barnier - are going to be used as conference documents .    4.782148699585185
we will talk about this on another day .    2.920348433838566
today we must give the green light to this conference , and , for its part , the group of the european people ' s party , mr president , is ready to give that green light .    3.7267758408191547
mr president , for the socialist group i can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the constitutional affairs committee .    4.759217315101312
we are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the igc precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the portuguese presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the igc be widened .    4.158742763311666
the amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term , because they are very important subjects in themselves .    4.455210465070876
let us call them the first three subjects of the igc .    3.091514260882526
these first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our member states during the last igc .    3.8601477300095923
they did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study .    3.619544741824395
they need a political deal .    3.1284931465538937
it is more a question of nine minutes , perhaps nine hours if it is difficult , locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects , not nine months .    3.676661020743348
in those circumstances it would be UNK not to widen the agenda .    3.3743059278500924
there are other issues that should UNK be looked at , especially before such a large widening of the union to so many new countries .    3.893019599999078
nobody is asking for a christmas tree .    2.8158181627770564
nobody is asking for an igc of the maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated .    2.8690634247801
however , there are six , seven , eight , nine perhaps , subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address .    3.427189646299964
there is time .    3.4429806977232795
remember the igc that led to the single european act .    3.875947020676532
it lasted only five months .    3.3848885080258753
the igc that led to the enormous maastricht treaty lasted a year .    3.091373810593697
only the amsterdam treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the british election if you were going to have any outcome from that igc so that was a different reason .    3.7265350145488503
a year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .    3.845001623636623
i am pleased to see that the commission shares our view .    3.316360126397535
the commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what parliament asked of it - to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles .    3.3230998255882485
i thank the commission for doing that even if , of course , i do not agree with everything the commission said .    3.9618162604735567
nonetheless the commission has provided a service and i pay tribute to commissioner barnier who is here with us today for doing that .    3.9264779172174813
they have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this igc .    4.164477399105799
that is all to the good .    3.6058966465147435
the parliament , the council presidency and the commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda .    4.416240745798662
i wish you every success , president of the council , in making sure that the european council agrees to this agenda and that on valentine ' s day when you start off the igc it will be under good auspices and you will bring it to a good conclusion , also when the french presidency takes over , by the end of this year .    3.8910038090328585
we should no longer be worried that the agenda for the igc will be restricted .    3.278503179702437
that is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of 14 member states yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner .    3.7940558653164946
it makes it impossible for those same member states , at the igc , to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and UNK of fundamental rights .    4.487244864092444
it is vital that the igc prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the treaty .    3.434727294051738
one part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the court .    5.253995838462976
another is for the union itself to sign up to the european convention .    5.14657956064784
another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside european union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build european parliamentary democracy .    3.499724192095796
my group strongly welcomes the igc and will be contributing to this treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent .    3.205285623249814
mr president , the group of the greens / european free alliance believes that the european parliament ' s decision to rush headlong into giving its opinion on the intergovernmental conference undermines the political significance of the request for talks with the council , and in the end , makes it rather irrelevant .    3.723444313178918
we would have preferred to have had greater clarification of the agenda and more guarantees on the method before giving our opinion , and frankly , we did not appreciate the discourtesy the portuguese presidency showed towards the european parliament by UNK the start of the intergovernmental conference for saint valentine ' s day , the first day of the strasbourg part - session .    3.764522413709593
moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .    4.997718484759041
i nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform .    4.6271393060856845
the events in austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the member states .    3.7801387017353796
it is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that , in any case , the european union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act , and to prevent and UNK the course of events .    4.854018247630895
we must take action on this at the intergovernmental conference , and i firmly hope that this opinion , that was given reluctantly , will not mean that the european parliament UNK to exert pressure on the council and the member states to make sure that this intergovernmental conference is not merely a technical exercise , but UNK the UNK that we saw a few hours ago in parliament .    4.711607284254098
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , to my mind , it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the intergovernmental conference is completely unacceptable politically and i would add that i consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful .    3.6009388702235383
after all , we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance , that is to say , we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 states , and together we have reached a stage at which closer european integration may be a reality in the not too distant future .    3.6602447133864207
how , though , is the union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now , i . e . before enlargement takes place ?    4.612334548296328
that is why we as a group are in favour of the intergovernmental conference .    3.2609070057624705
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the european union in the not too distant future .    3.569529400136623
my group , mr president - in - office of the council , noted with satisfaction that the council presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs .    3.3587928867472994
you can therefore rest assured that the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left is committed to seeing that the union gets on with the tasks in hand .    2.955828551625818
what we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of europe , and , in particular , a europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs , because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the UNK and concerns , the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians .    4.142529181097093
the politics of closed doors and private discussions ; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all .    3.0520359866893396
that is why we need transparency .    2.6447096004169386
i believe it falls to you , as president - in - office of the council , to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before , leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were UNK as to the content of the treaties .    3.1530072895355983
we believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the intergovernmental conference is going , and its outcome , rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent .    4.1488923654562075
we also take the view that the political decision - makers must at long last change the habit of a life - time and ask the citizens in referenda , once the intergovernmental conference is over , whether or not they go along with the way in which europe is to continue to develop in the future .    4.0404887046764
in this way , europe would truly belong to the citizens and the union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy .    3.4393639108235576
there is another central issue relating to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to .    3.4574455772710397
as a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the charter of fundamental rights , i wish to make the following point clear : neither my group nor i are content with making a solemn announcement about the charter .    3.46307136237403
after all , what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals ?    3.4323377186391393
no , to my mind this would only serve to UNK the credibility crisis facing the union .    3.6879511031139875
the poor turnout at the european elections really should have been warning enough for everyone .    3.4728848268208923
what we need are visible rights for each and every citizen ; the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the union .    2.936907830406366
together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens , and what i expect to come out of the intergovernmental conference is that the relevant cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year .    4.721842193733875
of course , we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a union of 27 plus member states .    3.211710755216987
we will not achieve this just by undertaking a UNK reform , as the council has resolved to do , and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny .    4.174137727908608
we need bold change and , at the same time , we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small states .    3.6810188900564467
this is something i would stress , particularly with my being an mep for one of the major member states .    4.021886522012942
i would like to thank the commission for the proposals they have put forward and i am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will UNK here in the european parliament , on all the issues you have raised .    3.893119904568377
there is one final issue i would like to raise .    3.3629774758042075
parliament ' s opinion expressly demands amendments to the treaty in the area of economic policy .    4.161199350643472
it is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies , but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision - making processes .    3.411050740793383
what we need most of all is to have the courage to undertake a critical examination of the union ' s policies to date .    3.6564805468956303
it is all about creating a socially just europe .    2.695606140485164
a socially just europe is still highly topical , for what we need to do as a matter of priority is place the fight against mass unemployment and poverty firmly at the centre of the union ' s policies .    3.7614611191287337
hence , to my mind , that includes having the courage to amend article 4 of the ec treaty , which defines the union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition . the same applies to article 105 , in my view , for the european central bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the treaty , of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment .    3.9353228687939166
mr president , the union for a europe of nations group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , as set by the helsinki council , i . e . UNK strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged europe , must be adhered to .    3.595326692530769
it must be adhered to in the interests of the fast , effective work of the conference , prior to enlargement .    3.827662447648333
this is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the european parliament or indeed to that of the commission , which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and , what is more , widen it in the wrong direction , i . e . moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter european system .    3.7299363625613258
our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which , when taken together , form a real alternative resolution .    3.362537486526923
in them we say that the forthcoming igc must look into a decision - making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty .    4.098878536983878
we deplore the fact that the commission , in its opinion of 26 january , limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised europe enlarging towards the east , a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions .    3.3438317460344553
the federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint , but this is a totally superficial concept .    4.051370468220517
quite the opposite , in an enlarged europe , mr president , the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing UNK .    3.8669420332851328
furthermore , the centralised european system , as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by UNK , erodes nations and , in eroding nations , erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves .    4.124890846979686
the europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker , as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending .    4.341529957906057
this is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of europe was clearly recognised , i . e . by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty .    3.283359675124255
we are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the european parliament and the commission .    4.05892697008631
a flexible europe , is a europe which respects its national democracies , which relies on the support of its nations , its national UNK , instead of continually persecuting them .    3.5820306652461333
it is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats , not the UNK , convoluted decision making procedures which the commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference .    3.4956457456517858
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of the italian radicals and i would like to say to the president of the council that he has seen what parliament ' s opinion is .    3.8511476949767265
it is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further european integration . i say this without being the slightest bit UNK about the highly respectable position of mr berthu and his group , but it is no coincidence that the european council ' s decision is supported by those who are , after all , in parliament because - and this is a highly respectable position - they are fighting against further integration .    4.063476330386143
this is the message that parliament is sending to the council .    3.740266815084256
i hope that the portuguese presidency - and i add my compliments to those already offered - can convey parliament ' s message and convey the result of our mediation work on saint valentine ' s day . in any case , tomorrow we shall vote against the igc agenda .    3.7640364780102966
this message must be very clear ; this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow .    4.2880262835930845
we shall give an opinion - which is technically and legally necessary - on convening the igc on 14 february , but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content .    3.5423284557763273
just consider the facts : we looked at austria a while ago , but we can also look at the stock markets , mr president : given that the euro , that great undertaking , has fallen 16 % against the dollar in a year , then perhaps , i will not say a government , but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of commissioners or similar issues .    4.110568459715412
there is clearly a more ambitious goal .    3.5794558706644075
we radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the house in order to consolidate this text , and for example , to request - just for the sake of mentioning articles 6 and 7 - that the very minimum be done , i . e . , that the european parliament should also be involved in drawing up the european constitution and that a proposal be made for the european parliament to adopt the amendments to the treaty .    5.144569467594545
we know that there are other topics : for example , many members have UNK , along with us , to the issue of the seat of the institutions , an issue that we believe should be considered at least at igc level .    4.534463920235194
in conclusion , i hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide - ranging for once , so that thanks also to the efforts of the portuguese presidency , this agenda will be revised .    4.1110429663865595
otherwise , the challenge really would be lost , not just for the present but also for many years to come .    4.022014618047793
mr president , the president of the commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the intergovernmental conference .    3.0460502661245448
he said that there would always be unanimity on social questions but , in the commission ' s draft , plans are quite explicitly being made for majority decision - making on issues relating to social security and on taxes connected with the internal market . this means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the member states to be changed by a majority in brussels , even if a unanimous french national assembly , a british house of commons and a dutch lower house should be against this .    4.24167423431761
and , in this regard , you are going to the heart of democracy as it relates to distribution policy and people ' s social conditions , which are what voters wish to influence when they go to the polls .    4.260775176487238
these are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day .    3.9061483816719726
brussels knows best .    3.5024212580447744
mr prodi also announced greater transparency , but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step , and that is not only my assessment , but also that of the european ombudsman .    4.403139277967358
today , the commission is obliged , on a case - by - case basis , to weigh considerations of confidentiality against people ' s demands for , and expectation of , transparency and , if the commission ' s regulation is adopted , the commission will be entitled to lock away whole categories of documents without having to give them specific consideration .    4.082878238598789
there is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of member states .    3.523563664257624
under the banner of " progress towards transparency " , a range of documents is being locked away from the general public .    3.455269151733854
it is , of course , thoroughly UNK .    2.8556004550692164
i want to ask mr prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the house which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .    4.2251659840847875
mr prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism , for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the commission ' s possession . there follows , however , a long , long list of exceptions , and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions .    4.21027842516321
in addition , we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions , which may be used for any purposes whatsoever . it is therefore .    4.765115160960442
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the portuguese council presidency ' s account has given me the distinct impression that we are approaching this intergovernmental conference with well - considered ideas and a high degree of openness .    3.337349250590921
we as a european parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve .    3.994907551776165
the preparations the commission has made so far are on the right track , although they do not go far enough if the european parliament ' s motions are anything to go by .    4.486257301418048
there is more to be said on that score .    3.8097573135409064
it is crucially important for this intergovernmental conference to score a hat UNK ; that of the power to act , democratic legitimacy and transparency .    3.620497625271171
in the end , it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens .    3.8050099294494197
at the same time of course , we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the european union .    3.9349483927872635
if we have been having a different debate here in this chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is .    3.5838292971999945
the european union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade .    3.431418000699917
this is an important sign that majority voting is a crucial pre - requisite to the european union ' s being able to function come what may .    3.585010763943439
of course we also want to extend the european parliament ' s corresponding powers in this area .    4.179534539308059
in addition , we as a european parliament are going to have to take action in relation to economic and monetary union , for there is a lack of supervision in this area .    4.439940427917524
the finance ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting , when in the ecofin council and in the euro 11 council , which is an unacceptable way to go on .    4.347167374881961
unlike mrs UNK , i am not in favour of extending supervision over the european central bank as i am an advocate of independence for the european central bank .    4.554395258756142
however , there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side .    3.4732997969212214
furthermore , the tripartite relationship of commission , council and parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy , where hitherto the council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case , especially in relation to the UNK fashioned crisis management measures , for which the commission alone has responsibility .    3.941480167134587
the overall plan failed to do justice to any of this .    3.2790241941680174
we must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the intergovernmental conference .    3.4564672145790274
the portuguese presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .    3.8423050473141993
there is another point i would just like to draw your attention to .    2.873159345056616
the debates we are having these days , on a certain european country ' s government , for example , show , do they not , that we must place the spiritual , moral , constitutional , community and common welfare - orientated UNK of the european union on a firm footing , and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the treaty for the same reason , as this will be a crucial stabilising factor .    4.692950273922713
i would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps UNK up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights .    4.479627917127973
the european union needs few , if any , new instruments , and it does not need any new competences .    3.867337429205833
what it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice .    3.428308113279261
for this reason , we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out , on behalf of the citizens , the tasks we have already formally been set in the treaty .    4.250849185653193
in my view , that is the most important issue this intergovernmental conference has to concentrate its energies on .    3.875441560850279
this is the crux of the matter .    2.272091801716281
mr president - in - office of the council , i am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your UNK .    2.9743090531469263
, chairman of the committee on constitutional affairs . ( it ) mr president - in - office , on listening to the various interventions , you have understood that in the committee on constitutional affairs and also among the leaders of parliament ' s political groups , the decision UNK - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the portuguese presidency , instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the intergovernmental conference .    3.794847410262525
i can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this , last week in the committee i chair , but we eventually decided to back the portuguese presidency and we would like to win this wager .    4.5873534868669035
you spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries , and therefore in their parliaments .    3.877537390064964
i would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments , which were represented by competent and UNK delegations .    3.856341995348641
the aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .    3.6598343258164565
we need to be careful and be sure that national governments try to convince their respective parliaments to ratify solutions that correspond to the union ' s requirements for growth and that they do not hide behind supposed resistance put up by the parliaments to avoid signing appropriate conclusions at the intergovernmental conference table .    3.697597075451435
however , we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the intergovernmental conference .    3.393426876701303
yesterday , we also discussed the commission , represented by commissioner barnier , who gave its opinion .    4.576514812692908
this effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , mr president - in - office , you also expressed different views .    3.616803007972689
nevertheless , we must stress that many people are aware , as they were yesterday too , of the risk that enlargement could compromise the original plan for the construction of a political europe , a risk that was , moreover , indicated in an interview that surely escaped no one ' s attention , owing to the authority of the person being UNK - jacques delors .    4.157910911046676
we must , therefore , ensure that at the intergovernmental conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the union and how to strengthen - and this has been discussed in the house even today , with regard to the situation in austria - the system of principles , values and rights underpinning the union and the role of the political institutions of the union , with regard , among other things , to running the economy .    4.745841866565924
we are counting on the portuguese presidency , we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the intergovernmental conference .    4.248782261454514
mr president , only a strengthened europe can cope with enlargement .    2.9111387442309047
only a strengthened europe is UNK to political UNK who exploit dissatisfaction .    3.554568891955966
that is why sweeping reforms are necessary and , hence , a widened igc agenda .    2.9426821552512594
the finnish presidency only listened to minimalist governments and , unfortunately , turned a deaf ear to this parliament .    3.3372860752949403
portugal should not take a UNK out its predecessor ' s book .    3.588332263474845
it is of the utmost importance that the european parliament and the commission join forces for this igc .    3.3224438873033857
in many ways , they share the same interests and the same insights .    3.611461207159565
an essential component of this joint effort should , in any case , be this parliament ' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the treaty .    4.021160107576093
of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .    4.321577610244691
what is the commission ' s verdict on this ?    3.437557192271686
it also means that our parliament president and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and , therefore , not only within the working party , but also at the same political level as the commission .    4.715826237682018
there is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the commission .    3.1098057311707925
not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new member states , but we owe them to ourselves .    3.965351866545093
if we allow europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement , we will UNK in our own political UNK .    4.798768078510712
mr president , there are days when i really cannot understand this parliament . it seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self - mutilation .    3.8497777045331225
after having restricted , on its own initiative , its participation in the igc to two minor seats , parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this igc .    4.211325611431741
the fact is , whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way , you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion , parliament is giving up the only lever which the treaty accords it , i . e . demanding a complete igc agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion .    3.310511784401041
why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow , 3 february , as a matter of urgency , when we could wait , in a position of strength , until the opening of the strasbourg part - session on 14 february , and thus force an agenda that is complete , and therefore consistent , on the council .    4.145185008931298
a good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today .    3.199886880060504
hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly , in our resolution , that the agenda for the igc is not equal to the issues , since in our haste , with UNK naivety , we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda .    4.341519623910378
if there is a democratic deficit at the end of this igc , then i say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .    4.276031675469231
whether we want it or not , since parliament itself is going to UNK the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates , the UNK for decisions is now going to move to the 15 member states of the union .    3.937557853285715
i therefore invite the members of parliament who form the great majority , those who last november ruled that the future of europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the amsterdam leftovers , to take up their UNK ' UNK and go and convince their own governments that this igc must be extended , since this is permitted according to the resolution of the helsinki council .    3.750119936533
because of the situation in austria , this is a dark day for europe .    4.9499210032693695
it makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .    3.876920006911105
in order to assert our fundamental values , they need to be laid down in writing , as a matter of urgency , and , beyond this igc , i believe we owe europe a constitution .    4.358341221236557
mr president , the draft resolution we are now discussing requires , precisely as before , that the forthcoming intergovernmental conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions .    3.9466261318452
the forthcoming enlargement of the union is used as an argument for this .    3.9410579662486303
i am convinced that this is an error of judgement .    3.408191367806191
a federal and centralist eu which UNK more and more in the government of the member states is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement .    3.84305935121151
a flexible eu which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries .    2.8604069860665953
paragraph d of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at eu level .    3.3436498044109664
it is not , however , possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union .    3.737687555131968
this text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the european central bank . this is UNK .    4.250624276216007
if there is a desire to make the eu more democratic , the whole construction of emu must be reconsidered .    3.6155662746775534
the central bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity . public control of the central bank must be improved if this is to become possible .    3.9946913802868003
the rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the stability pact must be re - examined and UNK so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective .    3.4565769317790473
article 56 of the treaty , prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital , must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control .    3.6733182286858543
in the majority of eu countries , there are now governments dominated by social democrats .    4.2693969440217865
it is remarkable that , now they have the opportunity to do so , none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union .    3.8922806446581837
it also , of course , damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a UNK to globalised capital .    3.577840865828213
the resolution requires the european parliament to have increased influence over the intergovernmental conference .    3.8375761742236647
it is , however , important to emphasise that the intergovernmental conference is and will remain a conference of the member states .    3.588354262742144
it is the member states ' parliaments , or people voting in referenda , who are to direct the development of the treaty .    3.6203677402098555
it is therefore out of the question that the european parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification .    3.5206012874711257
mr president , the committee on constitutional affairs has proposed an essentially positive text , which i shall vote for , even if i personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it .    3.616488975514992
nevertheless , the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the treaties have been planned were right .    3.8896955214344744
the union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether europe has certain joint principles and values , whether it comes down to an economic free trade area , or whether , on the other hand , it has a greater ambition : the desire to be a supranational union , in ways that have yet to be defined , that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world .    3.71192919407185
this is what is and was meant by the call for a european constitution .    3.466109344446812
the amendment of the treaties was , however , limited to a review of some internal rules , which was necessary and important , but did not answer the fundamental question : what is europe , what are its common principles and therefore , its objectives and limitations ?    4.386613363313116
however , politics UNK its revenge , and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda , it comes back in , as a matter of fact , through a door , and through the front door in the case of austria , since a party is entering the austrian government which seems to represent a return to intolerance , xenophobia and forms of racism .    3.539297435788149
and it is not a question of links with the past ; it is a question of prospects for the future , and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this .    4.1132417463735695
i belong to a world , the world of liberal catholics , which is not left - wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common european values , and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values .    3.9631796737407714
the council has done well to lay open this subject to europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a charter of fundamental rights , in a european constitution , then we shall construct a europe without a solid , lasting base .    4.420633309019678
commissioner barnier , i know - at least i think i know - that you and the representatives of the portuguese presidency share these values : make the most of the chances you were given by the december conference to include these subjects and principles , because this is the only way we will build a lasting europe .    4.124120544730089
mr president , i am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of nordic UNK and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which , looked long and hard at , threatens the whole of democratic europe .    3.2101046377203115
i am thinking of the contributions from mr bonde and mr sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively UNK but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist eu .    3.12362854897235
they rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles .    3.6325343256791145
i might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country , denmark , takes it for granted that , when we enlarge the circle of eu countries to include the envisaged huge number of new member states and when we in that way extend the breadth of the union , we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth , that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a united states of europe .    4.27418391427799
however , that is precisely what is happening .    4.190470399105152
with every single geographical extension to the area covered by the eu , we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth , and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the committee is contemplating , especially in paragraph 7 which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth .    4.1126284959967405
you can think what you like about mr haider , and i personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician , but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country ' s democratic process .    4.120316087300197
i welcome commissioner barnier and the portuguese presidency here this afternoon .    3.8427502696888545
on 14 february , we will see the launch of the igc which is to be completed by the end of 2000 .    4.373275671217525
this is a big task but it can be done .    3.414096966901952
i think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare europe for enlargement .    3.269916727150264
in other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important " amsterdam leftovers " .    3.4399736909660543
these include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re - weighting of voting in council to favour larger states and the number of commissioners in an enlarged europe .    3.7710854643742757
in relation to the latter point , ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal member of the commission irrespective of the number of member states joining .    4.265583397682255
we are prepared to consider re - weighting the votes in the council of ministers , provided that the larger member states are willing to agree to every member state having a full and equal member of the commission .    3.385576907659515
i feel i speak for many smaller countries when i make that particular point .    3.155897910925862
at the igc , we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the constitution .    4.593161380525493
we would accept the division of the treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller member states had in the re - negotiation of the whole policy area of the treaty .    4.308610016897544
in other words , if we are not represented fully in the commission we will not have an input into policy discussions .    4.074741834145332
so we are watching that entire point extremely carefully .    2.772420779697288
we look forward to the charter of fundamental rights and to seeing its contents .    2.9228646177869706
the treaty of amsterdam , mr president , has set the number of european parliament members at 700 and a debate is needed in this parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged europe .    4.30885695284285
mr president , i warmly recommend a vote in favour of the dimitrakopoulos / leinen resolution , which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the UNK of the agenda and our wish that the intergovernmental conference should take place as soon as possible .    3.610339637691072
in any case , this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon .    2.6692076984439264
i think that , under the present rules of the treaties , the european parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation .    4.406081635256877
on the contrary , we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms , in collaboration with the commission whose own proposals are worthy of note .    3.4991086620821528
we must use dialogue at every political level , including of course dialogue with the national parliaments .    3.1480820212009606
that way , we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms .    4.567438183599987
parliament ' s representatives at the intergovernmental conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that , with the union ' s institutional changes , we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the union .    4.544691637401615
they must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone .    3.0507180371044207
the issues to be dealt with at this intergovernmental conference are exceptionally sensitive .    3.5899889998694867
it may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term .    3.530196182198681
i will mention two point that may create tension .    2.86174266480591
one is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries .    2.968203106964949
europe is not , nor can it become a classic federal state .    3.680454876957928
the solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the european union , which is a union of states and peoples .    3.8680959186152695
the other area of conflict is more difficult .    2.912844988970667
owing to the imminent increase in membership , the bodies of the future european union must become more effective .    4.488858686378419
this means that they must function more simply and more rapidly .    3.0516967177518746
by its very nature , however , the european union is , and will remain , a complex and convoluted multi - governmental institution .    3.825080008871944
possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist .    3.3188641984712297
of course they do , but they are not UNK .    3.7164945606759683
if the limits are exceeded because of a one - sided quest for effectiveness , then the legitimising basis of the european union will suffer .    3.870587692634786
i am , however , optimistic .    4.315256947149325
the most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the union .    3.2063903528718924
it is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the union , which will , however , be necessary if the union is to enlarge as planned .    4.323213861048651
the commission ' s former president , jacques delors , has once again publicly raised the issue of a european UNK .    3.2918637971769056
he has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions , for the sake of clarity .    4.598959127321245
the commission ' s current president , mr prodi , and the high representative , mr solana , have put forward ideas along the same lines .    4.053188932124653
last november , the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for europe : the UNK UNK model .    3.574020864901532
in the next resolution on the igc , parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility .    4.79409482078116
both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings , as proposed by the group of the european liberal democrats and reform party .    3.5052824057432637
my colleagues , mrs frassoni and mr onesta have already spoken , somewhat UNK , about some aspects of the matter in hand .    3.527854342470489
i wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity , not just between union and member states but between member states and their own internally self - governing regions .    3.9557415105270586
this has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about .    3.834771349383408
may i particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this parliament .    4.28559511031859
a ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that parliament can safely become and remain a UNK assembly .    3.1262144106050096
if you apply the existing principle of UNK proportionality , six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants , you already have the situation where luxembourg with UNK , 000 people has more members in this chamber than wales , which is a partly self - governing region of the united kingdom .    3.575194675827436
scotland , with a population of 5 million , has eight seats in this house at the moment ; denmark and finland , with the same population , have sixteen .    4.705393357367431
what will happen to a place like scotland , which i represent here ?    3.5385744282335425
it will become totally invisible !    2.9688119377453366
members of this house should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions , people in scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new member states from within existing ones .    3.913113557488984
a growing body of opinion in scotland holds that view .    3.342305803993704
mr president , to say that the european union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new . it has been said many times .    4.3178243055431
this time , however , it is true .    4.627788258243343
we have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement .    4.436555064786125
the question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not .    3.6350166008929343
will we enlarge with or without deep reform ?    3.063106726794015
that is the debate , and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the intergovernmental conference , its agenda or its method .    4.439699214131043
it is clear that the council , for the moment , has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place .    3.9450568441083456
that puts enlargement in danger . it jeopardises any prospect of political union and , of course , it is difficult for the public to understand .    3.8928142770225707
the council must realise that , if we want the future of the european union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations , the next intergovernmental conference must go much further .    4.172499856352265
the council is consulting us and parliament is giving its opinion .    3.5913848557555865
we want an intergovernmental conference , but not this one .    3.875754342137757
must there be an igc ?    3.9982315623816818
of course there must , but not this type of intergovernmental conference .    3.8736613751474165
the agenda must go much further . we must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the igc and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic .    4.310720330511366
being much more democratic means greater participation by the european parliament and allowing the commission to exercise even more - yes , more - its ability to take the initiative .    4.224441650088507
we must clearly set firm objectives .    2.723344491858543
the functionalist approach is over , for better or for worse .    2.8636324506666306
the functionalist approach has brought us to this point .    2.648000267688493
have we achieved results ?    3.640228505657652
yes , but the point is to make a qualitative leap and , speaking in political terms , this , mr president - in - office of the council , means convincing the other community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment .    3.759145591225647
mr president , ladies and gentlemen of the house , at this stage , following this debate which i have listened to most attentively and with great interest , i should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of president prodi .    3.659997288884483
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work , your two rapporteurs , mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen , proposed that parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to article 48 of the treaty and thus , if this opinion were adopted , the intergovernmental conference could effectively start on 14 february , as suggested by the portuguese presidency .    3.4480515979565993
as far as we are concerned , after producing the opinion expected from the commission , according to this same article 48 of the treaty , we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated .    3.858138800492116
we know , i know myself , that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us .    4.3360459853727304
i would just like to make a few comments , after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups .    3.5393002752881517
firstly , ladies and gentlemen , the commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda .    4.311506832464085
i understand this anxiety , this fear that the agenda may be too limited , and yet i feel , as i said to the committee on constitutional affairs on returning from helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this helsinki mandate .    4.457384952664725
indeed , it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate , which the commission framed for its own opinion , but using all the terms thereof , plus everything between the lines .    3.86669356111777
we have not restricted ourselves to the three so - called leftovers , which is , in any case , an incorrect label .    4.18860340897814
i do not like the term ' leftovers ' any more than UNK corbett does .    3.1073217939260545
it gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects , and difficult , so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at amsterdam to deal with them in depth .    3.6659045411422566
as far as we are concerned - i am responding to mr seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects , even though i do consider them as priorities , and consider that they must be dealt with now .    3.6617140166439057
they are the first but they are not the only subjects , mr seguro , that the conference must deal with .    4.520765196686855
we are ready for it , whether it is a matter of the charter of fundamental rights , on which work has started , the cfsp and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations , or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work : reorganisation of the treaties .    4.402962480580904
i have heard many comments on the commission ' s opinion , which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth , with specific indications of new draft articles , but no one has said that we were going beyond the helsinki mandate .    3.670163949724494
this proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate , by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers .    3.781031778965101
as regards the participation of the european parliament in the conference proceedings , i think that mr seixas da costa will agree with me , on the basis of our shared experience , in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives , professor tsatsos and mr brok , are going to be working .    3.737896599171193
of course , the final trade - offs will be made , as in any institutional negotiations , and i think this is no bad thing , at council level , especially at the level of the council of heads of state and government , who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands .    4.025065710171608
let me point out , in passing , that the commission president , mr prodi , is also a council member , and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role , alongside the heads of state and government , particularly during the final period .    3.945477766037905
however , these council proceedings must be carefully prepared .    2.970709350105971
this preparatory work , this fine - UNK , must not be omitted , ladies and gentlemen of the house . i know from my own experience in amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful , and that it will not just be limited to technical details .    4.531907412568077
i think that all of us , the personal representatives of the ministers of foreign affairs , your two representatives , and myself , as a representative of the commission , will be going into matters in detail , but it will be afterwards , at a different level , one in which we will also be participating , that the last trade - offs must be made .    5.095103060603808
throughout this conference , ladies and gentlemen , it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important , but the quality of what they will be saying .    4.967437706160544
and once again i should like to point out in this house , in view of my own experience prior to amsterdam , that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the european parliament , prior to amsterdam , the quality of what mrs UNK and mr brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations .    4.284439039977208
i am sure that the situation will be just the same and , as far as i am concerned , in my current position , i shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations .    4.253201084057171
i am sure that in this way the european parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the commission will be .    4.933361601424716
we now await , therefore , with great interest , ladies and gentlemen of the house , your next opinion , in which you will specify parliament ' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations .    4.193747982319434
it is extremely important that the two european institutions involved in these negotiations , the commission on the one hand and parliament on the other , alongside the council members , explain clearly to the citizens of the union continually , every day , what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as european institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged union and the common interest .    4.266631446794238
in the coming months , ladies and gentlemen of the house , the commission will therefore be working in close cooperation , on good terms , with your two representatives , professor tsatsos and mr elmar brok , in order to reconcile our points of view , if need be .    3.6434646498320067
quite probably , our points of view and our positions will not always be the same . there will probably be differences of opinion , that would be only normal .    3.9070482669167728
the important thing is that we are consistent , and i have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since i accepted the position of commissioner .    4.437429993250832
our concern and our ambition , therefore , on a large number of subjects , is to be on the same UNK and to carry these negotiations forward successfully .    5.043885964618187
this will not be a matter of chance , since , let me repeat , i feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the european union .    4.227191548454591
finally , i should like to make three additional comments , quite briefly , mr president .    2.9686396774646537
firstly , to congratulate and thank mr napolitano , the chairman , and the committee on constitutional affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments , the committee on constitutional affairs and the commission for an initial joint debate .    3.6634454752180723
i have said , furthermore , that i would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments .    3.8431971294435665
tomorrow , i shall be in london .    3.732317236873608
in a fortnight ' s time , i shall be in berlin .    3.4238232031337636
in three weeks ' time , i shall be in paris , and i shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another .    4.108734703726856
i feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive , and i should like to thank you for taking it .    3.7348283252074657
my second brief comment is to thank the portuguese presidency , particularly mr seixas da costa , for his proactive approach .    3.953265297316321
indeed , the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own : the portuguese presidency cannot be just an interim presidency .    3.5694632252124454
it will have to initiate these negotiations .    3.7210991026329006
we are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the french presidency , in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 2000 .    3.9206668667050075
not only that a conclusion can be reached , but that a successful conclusion can be reached , which is not necessarily the same thing .    3.629606919048066
concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully .    4.46126298986087
the handover will have been made , but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made , by yourself , mr president , and by the portuguese presidency , are going to be extremely important , as is the nature of this handover .    5.43494761000857
it is all the work which is going to be carried out together , under your guidance particularly , in the course of these few months , which is extremely important .    4.483550532392064
we have great confidence in the portuguese presidency ' s ability to bring this task to a successful conclusion , and indeed great expectations thereof . portugal is a small country , but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions .    3.846918278901408
after having heard prime minister guterres , the minister of foreign affairs and yourself , i have confidence in the ambition of the portuguese presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations .    3.8948784356269748
it can count on the partnership of the commission over the next few months .    3.8513466558523386
finally , let me repeat , we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations .    3.957380447252725
these are difficult subjects , subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain .    3.221918599871541
all the more reason for members of the european parliament , ministers , commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens , to public debate .    3.8005275634500904
as far as the commission is concerned , it will , ladies and gentlemen , be taking initiatives to UNK and UNK this public debate .    4.709559995413838
cross - border services    4.035560324799337
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :    1.9129003561689215
a5 - 0007 / 2000 by mrs berger , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on a proposal for a european parliament and council directive on the posting of workers who are third - country nationals for the provision of cross - border services ( com ( 1999 ) 3 - c4 - 0095 / 1999 - 1999 / 0012 ( cod ) ;    2.1771000487447956
a5 - 0012 / 2000 by mrs berger , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on a proposal for a council directive extending the freedom to provide cross - border services to third - country nationals established in the community ( com ( 1999 ) 3 - c4 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / 0013 ( cns ) .    2.2484396710338723
- ( de ) mr president , commissioner , firstly i would like to apologise for being a little UNK today , but we austrian meps have had a lot of explaining and talking to do .    3.7645211110571593
i would first like to say how indebted i am to the commission for UNK the initiative , and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today .    4.416051557286832
it has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the european economy and to 5 million third - country nationals in the european union who are here as workers or on a self - employed basis .    3.9978613810518304
the current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the european court of justice relating to employees , i refer in particular to those relating to the rush UNK case and that of van der UNK .    4.137664057511846
these have , in fact , clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third - country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross - border services and this without having to obtain work permits .    3.5504433643795017
however , the european court of justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the member states were unable to clarify this issue .    4.172175852570379
furthermore , not all member states have UNK by the court of justice ' s UNK with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement , and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross - border services ; barriers that are often impossible to overcome , especially for the smaller companies .    4.154408823235367
the situation as far as self - employed people are concerned is that current community invested legal rights do not afford third - country nationals the right to provide cross - border services .    3.5162550887090034
there is no doubt that we need a legislative act here .    3.3026671680366912
both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for eu enterprises .    3.1424051223426304
it is not about establishing original rights for third - country nationals UNK on freedom of movement .    2.8604546102886537
i , together with the european parliament ' s committee on legal affairs and the internal market , are therefore of the opinion that the commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view , as expressed in the report produced by the council ' s legal service , is inappropriate .    4.3447676523964605
consequently , i do not see that there is any real obstacle to the council ' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned .    4.146733699468203
i also believe that parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the council to adopt the directives as opposed to the commission ' s proposal .    3.798705180084849
many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the council , and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by UNK of UNK law and economic good sense .    4.113097632918311
when it comes to acceptance by the council , i can only urge the commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by parliament as possible , even if some of them deviate substantially from the original commission proposals .    4.604299549794939
i am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the council on this basis .    4.1509047171899995
turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments , one of the essential differences is that , in place of a " service provision card plus notification for each individual contract " system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract .    4.021114192471214
this system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms .    3.3880555437317112
however , in order to compensate for this , all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued , and as the commission ' s proposal would have it , more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued .    3.3115460598775357
this should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self - employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident .    3.612110005581473
likewise , the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued , namely under the terms of an opposition procedure .    3.62241318140345
what we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the eu service provision card for all member states , rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual member states .    4.036357659554521
i believe this system is also more suited to practical needs .    3.111156304450353
i would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months , and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting .    3.7583614489436483
however , we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months .    3.339631427602523
when it comes to self - employed persons , in addition to the amendments already described , we propose that the UNK criteria should be made more stringent , and that we should make provision for the possibility of UNK any abuse in the way of bogus self - employment .    4.205355235659654
i would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .    3.0931603762834223
of course i would add that i continue to support this committee ' s amendments , which they adopted unanimously .    3.5359134475824745
i have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting council decisions .    3.251166329250952
i must say i have received extremely contradictory statements from parliament ' s services as to exactly how these council decisions should be quoted ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them .    3.5649297461769134
two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report .    3.061136111511012
i withdraw the two other amendments - that is amendment no 18 to the report on self - employed persons and amendment no 21 on employed persons .    3.794732371711117
i can only urge the conference of presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology , i . e . the correct way to quote .    3.348874297465973
this would make our rapporteur ' s life considerably easier in the future .    3.6028223246464406
there is also a proposed amendment to both of mrs de palacio ' s reports .    3.2578784995498866
unfortunately i have to say that i am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market resolved on unanimously , and i would like to stand by this outcome , which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions .    3.8795889359238123
on a final note , i would like to thank all those in the committee who supported me in compiling these reports , which were far from easy to produce .    3.625221208654538
i would like to single mr wieland out for special mention , for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report , contributing excellent and constructive ideas ; and this without being in a position to receive the UNK awarded a rapporteur .    3.2850788982275447
that is why he deserves special mention !    2.980941835282064
.    2.4274255028413507
( nl ) mr president , i am pleased i have been given the opportunity to make a few introductory remarks at the end of rapporteur mrs berger ' s speech , after which i will , of course , listen with all due attention to the next speakers . if you allow me , mr president , i would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate .    4.10802704180334
may i say how the commission welcomes the european parliament ' s support for the two proposals on the freedom to provide services and on third - country employees , the topic of the debate .    4.007576929384324
i am extremely grateful for the work that mrs berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge .    3.74544991703106
i would also thank mrs palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .    2.2973177001434424
the commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards .    3.7690300575876043
if the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more , or all , member states , the procedure would be more flexible still .    3.8568237667334713
the commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card .    2.6134378663786912
however , i do not consider a three - month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a member state .    2.892904770489302
the commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is UNK at short notice .    3.2072892386762177
an efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross - border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market .    3.2451143531465694
it seems over the top to us for other member states to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .    3.671027096396172
indeed , it should be possible for a third - country subject who has legal status in a member state to be admitted to other member states too .    3.617782399472733
neither does the commission accept the proposal that legal status in a member state should be valid three months after the card has expired .    3.6686660312889896
following completion of the service , it is not acceptable for the third - country subject in question to remain any longer in the member state in which the service is provided .    4.158577336908549
that is why the commission supports mrs palacio ' s amendment no 22 in both respects .    3.3061275441606592
as far as the second proposal is concerned , the commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self - employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal .    3.4896162134750486
these are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments .    3.098912193344245
i hope that , at the end of the debate , when all the speakers have contributed , i will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments .    4.1918924049352535
mr president , tomorrow will see a large majority within the ppe group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , as well as the amended version .    3.0212714500884137
i propose to confine my comments to two areas .    3.2437186309326176
firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve , that is achieve in the real sense .    4.67219367666011
there is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account .    5.264113349936989
my comments start from the premise that we are talking about an UNK individual in UNK employment .    3.388744662817565
then there are the interests of the member states , which , being on the receiving end , may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario .    4.17617201662669
if we are going to abide by the one extreme , that is the interests of the member states , then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high .    4.423649365962558
there is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card .    3.728187168789942
if i were to go to the other extreme , as few hurdles as possible that is , then i would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the member states would not sign up to this directive .    4.013826812484414
i would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place , but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high , in reality no one would apply for the card . alternatively , i might have no directive at all .    3.8910978860185983
neither outcome would be satisfactory .    3.2807188253827717
perhaps this is also why , as is UNK to be the case , the council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well .    4.575061657600859
we have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution .    4.250265507993948
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis - à - vis the business world , but once these have been overcome , implementation is as easy as it possibly could be .    2.8376046707749816
therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more member states .    2.905559403441573
if a company in france says that it has an employee who has to work in denmark on a permanent basis , and only in denmark , then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for denmark .    4.405504095874337
accordingly , the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance .    3.2011510300539445
in return for this , however , we want early notification obligations to be discontinued , rather it should just be a matter of the employee taking the justification for the posting to the other member state along with them , and this might take the form of the contract forming the basis for his / her posting .    4.628878541757805
consequently , i too have to say that i am in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .    2.713145380154181
perhaps there was a certain amount of UNK misunderstanding on the part of the commission .    3.532835213586402
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution .    3.4105190333999165
if a particular member state was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country , then this particular member state would be able to UNK this card , as it were , for the reasons cited in this directive , which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution .    4.009423719569564
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter .    3.3615372807853783
most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers .    3.4825672633220695
we all know that there are still various parts of the treaty , some of them very old , which are still referred to as ec .    4.294108528056709
we are aware that this directive is founded on ec law and not on eu law .    3.378421952292935
however , before the elections we - the council , the commission , parliament , the press , unions and companies that is - worked towards making the europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens .    4.15533912972145
we have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from eec to ec to eu .    3.1891194855399676
they have now got to grips with " eu " .    2.8883355008168343
we would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to UNK the product we are proposing to deliver " ec service provision card " and not " eu service provision card " .    3.282756312881552
it is the world of the eu that the citizens are interested in , this is the one that counts in their eyes .    4.811358378536794
i would urge the council and the commission to move in this direction .    3.114908737454684
mr president it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so i shall be very brief indeed .    3.841610317995687
one of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism .    3.0866948083263166
this directive is , of course , not in itself directly about that .    3.6543927158759746
it is about attending to the needs of the internal market , creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self - employed .    3.4344927068015654
that is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger .    2.950114832421342
we welcome that , and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision , we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law .    4.005059795417473
nevertheless , i have tabled an amendment .    2.8038521538732453
mrs berger , in your amendment no 2 to recital 6 , you mention legal security .    3.486106899127254
the first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the UNK permit , since all that does is create legal insecurity .    3.507576523556816
you rightly raise the concern , also expressed by mr wieland , at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire , but i think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit .    3.83075573906788
if the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date , it must end on that date .    3.4863869337857754
legal security requires this .    3.4735948915858783
on the other hand , with regard to point d of amendment no 10 , which refers to the first directive , you suggest that , for reasons of public security or public order regulations , a member state may reject the validity of the card .    3.72977699449442
there are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .    2.9391902590674643
it makes no sense for any worker within the schengen area , since he or she will already have undergone a UNK process in order to enter the first member state , and the second member state would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory .    3.4961685588545754
it therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity .    3.226611216548471
in the case of a non - schengen state , in the last paragraph of amendment no 22 , that possibility is UNK , and is perfectly expressed , and i believe this provides greater legal security .    4.340677055259776
i would therefore ask members to examine my amendment carefully , and i hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result .    3.5920508892022123
on the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across europe and to give effect to the recent court cases mrs berger referred to in her opening remarks .    3.6979934507595815
however , in the case of the united kingdom , we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable .    3.8214724502761004
partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the united kingdom .    4.38815684665458
under the arrangements contained in the treaties , the united kingdom retains its border controls .    3.955016428405577
under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation , third country nationals wishing to move to the uk under the procedures described , will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another member state , thereby by - passing uk border controls .    3.3153849445907437
if there is to be a change to the present united kingdom border arrangements , that change should be made by the united kingdom government and the united kingdom parliament and not en UNK by the european legislative process .    5.2159118989545386
for that reason , we shall vote against both these proposals .    3.188706202944277
mr president , commissioner , first and foremost i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to mr wieland for the efforts they have UNK in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner .    3.5588136882203183
these two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services .    4.268867987471428
the new regulation for cross - border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises .    3.3652470749817636
the strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the eu service provision card - and i am with mr wieland on this - are essential , for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts .    4.177067144456882
why do i think we need the directive so much ?    4.286942189349485
three reasons and they are as follows : on account of the economic importance of third - country workers in the eu , in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market .    4.444781645380233
therefore , whilst i welcome the strict basic conditions , i would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the member states to be made as effective and simple as possible .    4.950707976392954
my last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the commission . will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations ?    3.5810318728947763
how is article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ?    3.7406398100596534
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms , namely the free movement of people and services , did not apply to them .    3.5644046192185033
indeed , they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the member states where a service had to be provided .    3.771275307715941
there are approximately thirteen million third - country subjects who reside within european territory .    2.9855837010759747
i assume that , although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known , their number will most definitely not be low .    3.212432504282557
so , up to now , their access to the entire territory of the union has not been regulated by community legislation .    4.399498507078092
the aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the eu service provision card .    4.378058220917325
it seems important , in this respect , to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner , namely within five days of a simple declaration ' s having been submitted to a member state where the service will be provided ; and that , also to prevent misuse , this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended .    4.081401227143274
i have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the commissioner .    3.7589684994569224
having also studied the amendments submitted , i concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow .    4.191177020819131
may i , to finish off , thank mrs berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having , in that way , added an important degree of meaning to her report ?    3.4548217687996217
i think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .    4.226767431306572
mr president , thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail .    2.666258528615781
in the course of my speech , i would also like to address lord inglewood regarding the remark he has just made .    3.670796256884807
regarding the first proposal on third - country employees , the commission is prepared to adopt amendments nos 2 , 11 , 12 , 15 , 16 and 22 .    3.2608090261303286
amendments nos 7 and 8 are acceptable too , provided the situation of posting is established in the member state in which the service provider is established .    3.7794515329626304
the commission also agrees with amendment no 11 , except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months , as i explained just now .    3.2487245672588627
we also welcome amendment no 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one member state to all member states .    3.1131638574090124
in terms of comitology , amendments nos 14 and 21 also apply in part , insofar as the rights of parliament are concerned .    3.856126243799628
i regret that the commission has found amendment no 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three - month period and the role of the member state in which the service is provided are concerned .    3.785992689862628
in this respect , the commission supports amendment no 22 , as i have already mentioned .    3.4721390214931187
the other amendments are unacceptable .    3.31352605345419
as amendment no 18 refers to directive 96 / 71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary .    3.433816885698461
acceptance of amendment no 17 by the commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued .    3.852715111073457
surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the member states .    3.097596699310174
amendment no 19 is also unacceptable , given my thoughts on amendment no 10 .    3.251568180594289
the commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal .    3.568600422216138
i would like to add that amendment no 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable .    2.994079675695417
as far as amendment no 15 on the definition of the term " self - employed " is concerned , the commission will , as i have already remarked , provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged .    3.840888695349203
i would now like to move on to lord inglewood ' s remark .    2.7834706295220477
he referred to united kingdom border controls and i would like to say to him that member states , and this includes the united kingdom , are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders .    3.867731017305688
this applies , as already stated , to the united kingdom and it also applies to belgium , where it was recently of relevance .    4.047735024000692
with regard to the remark made by mr karas , i am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from poland being used as employees in his country .    4.480474502928328
the commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the european union which employ staff from non - eu countries .    3.83566813475845
the question is , furthermore , one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way .    3.5062578996064926
in my opinion , this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the european union and perhaps not to the present debate .    3.8146110347930606
on behalf of the commission , i would be more than happy to make myself available to mr karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point .    3.49311813358994
i will keep myself free in this connection .    3.313056490646996
finally , i would like to thank parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and , in particular , of course , the rapporteur , mrs berger .    4.148198488851409
thank you very much , commissioner bolkestein .    2.5361320285424056
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 00 a . m .    2.0459594608426883
court of first instance    5.46312913000951
mr president , i would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report , which , on reading it , gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the council ' s draft decision .    3.2522719235667434
however , this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results , such as the incorporation into the finnish presidency ' s document of 7 december 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the intergovernmental conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation , composition and competences of the community courts .    3.971908000952263
for this reason , i would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by vice - president marinho .    2.9177682894573285
mr president , the reform of the community judicial system has become an essential requirement if , in the future , we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales , and if , in the future , the european union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon .    4.894928062976005
today - and i must say this with pride and satisfaction - this parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we europeans believe that the european political project is much more than just an internal market , and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests .    4.976608854907021
behind these principles , mr president , lies the justice system .    4.9616705720924115
however , justice delayed is justice denied , and we must reflect on this notion .    3.7443919184397028
the working document prepared by the court itself contains alarming information .    3.7032815984275333
for this reason , the draft reform , which has been drawn up by the rapporteur , vice - president marinho , is to be welcomed .    3.8104982197507757
it is true that it is a stopgap solution , but we must rely on stopgap solutions because , at the moment - as he himself has pointed out - we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the intergovernmental conference .    3.9224953728188914
we have to offer solutions which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice .    3.434022027713821
i would like to make two observations during this intervention , which stem from the report itself , given this parliament ' s obligation , in accordance with the treaty , to produce a very UNK report , which does not go into depth .    4.112427087204819
these are two of vice - president marinho ' s ideas and , i believe , they are UNK by the whole of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market .    3.2928479227857608
the first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance , and that they should be given one more UNK .    3.99738351765396
the second is that the translation services of the court of first instance and the court of justice should be separated .    3.7893509256878377
at the moment , the court of first instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated .    3.2237327955955113
according to the treaty , one of the founding principles of this community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our UNK the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language .    4.619070123637509
since we are talking about the intergovernmental conference , let us consider just two points .    4.270004642578659
the first concerns this parliament .    2.821248579811118
i believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the court of justice , even in the appointment of judges .    4.112676543528259
above all , we wish to see an extension of the competences of the court of justice , hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations , in other words , its resources .    3.6880312201465633
we wish to see its competences extended , especially within chapter iv of the treaty of the european community and with regard to chapter vi of the treaty on european union and also a review of certain possible options , certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens .    4.182094809037132
and i refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days .    4.071348608405324
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report .    2.5987727709321664
it has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency .    3.7409667822165784
both concern cases with decisions pending before the court of justice .    3.060284874735595
the first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not UNK on it should be subject to vat .    4.179492650763501
the decision could have huge implications for our local economy .    3.0092224313656204
secondly there is a UNK within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age .    3.4098255971496085
these are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in europe ' s system of justice . delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy .    3.2173142282329246
this is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect , but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the european court .    4.368995734581976
amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references .    4.226560556935966
this should not be taken as a criticism of the court or of its staff , rather of the court ' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing european union .    4.226060217455363
the proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim UNK , but europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .    3.9354033112235722
in the face of coming enlargement the igc must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system .    3.646822919982863
otherwise we will all , as elected representatives , be faced with more and more UNK from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice .    3.7434295279988015
mr president , i too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report .    2.127838738021833
i also fully endorse his findings , in which , in particular , he suggests increasing the number of UNK for judges at the court of first instance and providing the latter with its own translation service .    3.9583382847107886
in point of fact , i consider this to be necessary because we heard , following the committee on legal affairs and the internal market ' s visit to luxembourg , that it is of course inevitable , a god - given fact as it were , that the court of justice should take precedence over the court of first instance when it comes to using the joint translation service , and so more often than not , important cases handled by the court of first instance cannot be given the attention they deserve .    3.587692857569922
however i also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .    4.527888733781334
for example , i believe it is worth considering making the court of first instance that of last instance , if applicable , and making this a final competence , in those spheres where benches of the court , which resemble courts , pass judgement at a preliminary stage - i need only mention the UNK alicante or whatever the plans are for european civil service law .    3.3031405146689043
i am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the european commission ' s inclination to UNK competition decisions and transfer them back to national level .    3.8648854404789486
it seems to me that we need to give this some thought , as these cases will no longer fall to the court of first instance of course but to the court of justice as draft decisions .    3.7176571348217258
we need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind .    2.917385941962082
where possible , one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the court of first instance .    3.1645886133891916
in addition , we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which meps , not to mention groups , lodged a complaint against the european parliament - for the court of first instance to be responsible for such cases , when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the court of justice than before the court of first instance .    3.7498530979155698
on a final note , i too believe that olaf requires monitoring under rule of law .    2.677026995187493
as things stand , olaf is in a vacuum and can do as it UNK .    3.6156366444019765
it is essential for olaf to be monitored by a court .    3.250569085633897
the only court that could reasonably do so would be the court of first instance .    3.165926494719942
that would be another way of UNK the reform process on .    3.9283759584804243
mr president , i would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work .    2.6489952157186614
the european union is a system based on law .    2.84386426286113
it must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law .    3.6585147128685023
furthermore , if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as madame palacio vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied .    3.6708916827799567
the evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem .    4.065858909357906
in my own country , UNK tells of the teeming UNK of UNK brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of european judges .    3.2719702623476596
there are less than three dozen at the UNK of the european judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the european legal system .    3.9379475340844725
the extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding anglo / french dispute over british beef which has caused such UNK in my country and such frustration with the workings of the union ' s disputes resolution procedures .    3.6648917478781984
this has been compounded , so some who advise me believe , by the rules of procedure in the french courts which make it well UNK impossible for non - french nationals to proceed against the french government .    3.4644301998069764
certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible .    3.3502798797240696
this contrasts most UNK with the united kingdom courts where spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the united kingdom government in circumstances which were very comparable .    3.9974947337217777
i would therefore like to ask the commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to parliament and to me their findings .    3.656467937295778
i would be grateful if the commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this .    2.5999829643122143
mr president , on behalf of commission president , mr prodi , i would like to respond as follows .    3.597251151938392
the commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the european parliament regarding the request made by the court of justice and the court of first instance . the UNK of this request is , on the one hand , to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the court of first instance , such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the court of justice and , on the other hand , to increase the number of judges at the court of first instance .    3.6580944019451787
may i add that , on behalf of the commission , i listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that i have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas .    3.9481968042114444
the unease is justified .    3.3709609704053016
it has been said more than once : justice delayed is justice denied .    2.6492408917053796
the commission UNK with these considerations .    3.5438240646857753
in the light of this sympathy , i would like to continue my response as follows .    3.651414171441372
as your parliament is aware , the commission is convinced that , without fundamental reform , the community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines .    4.339689991378951
consequently , the commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the court of justice and the court of first instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades .    4.1450542093824785
the commission is aware of the request made by the court of first instance to increase its number of judges , but at the moment , the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which i have just mentioned .    3.471254623328053
in other words , once this study is complete , the commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible .    3.298297174876973
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.7835196827501634
exceptional financial aid to kosovo    5.2705989291928645
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0022 / 2000 ) by mr brok , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the proposal for a council decision providing exceptional community financial assistance to kosovo ( com ( 99 ) 0598 - c5 - 0045 / 00 - 1999 / 0240 ( cns ) .    2.373170366265209
i have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes .    2.8575540207231835
i propose that we start the debate immediately .    2.925987907928778
he will join us and speak as soon as he arrives .    3.6130727326286918
mr president , this is an important and urgent matter , and parliament is complying with a request from the commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and women are dying in kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero , these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid .    3.6986812249460677
an urgent request has been referred to us , and we approve it .    4.8947018794850985
we have been asked for eur 35 million .    2.89181698473154
we agree that it may be granted and we call on the commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring , once the decision has been taken , that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible .    3.835855899068539
we are talking about macrofinancial aid .    2.851427358715378
there are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal UNK of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration .    3.4902030657527843
this is not our opinion .    3.352710184928371
our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region .    4.077316243145692
indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state .    3.7667767498369216
the second important problem is that we have been asked for payments , the donors have made commitments and , obviously , we are the only ones actually paying .    4.10862164005807
the other parties are not paying .    3.197787574353665
we wish to see an end to this one - sided situation regarding requests for financial aid .    3.2177933300843535
we would like the commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this .    4.160803549918431
this is not in order to limit or be UNK with our financial contribution to kosovo but , quite the contrary , to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors .    3.906708711826904
from that point of view , the proposed facility is a two - phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest .    3.313869971199214
finally , we have three questions for the commission in this regard . firstly , we need the commission to give us , on a regular basis , the list and the amounts that other donors contribute .    4.669321369122865
when we come to pay , we want to know what the others are paying .    3.8881940806859645
secondly , we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation .    3.167638550592764
during the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet , according to our information , no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date .    3.2465765911363733
this is serious , since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in kosovo .    3.4302860329951486
finally , and this follows on from what i have just said , we would like the commission to inform the committee on budgets on a very regular basis , monthly , regarding progress on payments made .    4.211038917104848
we have commission documents which speak of firm commitments .    3.1005197093410346
it is not firm commitments that we need , just plain commitments would suffice , and we need to know what has actually been paid and , more especially , what has not been paid .    4.397575904381723
kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment .    3.5742210170928956
mr president , if we are going to discuss kosovo today , as we have done many times before , then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in kosovo , or of whether in fact anything has been done at all .    4.568238714510057
what i mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to UNK , and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate .    4.577038162984262
as of 9 february , there will be something known as the kosovo transitional council , which will comprise representatives of the political parties , the minorities and civil society , and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament .    4.858992645753856
this is a positive move and we welcome it , but i believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare , for elections are planned for the autumn .    4.003251301700025
no one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis - à - vis unmik .    3.7010585013591752
in other words , there are quite a few UNK that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either .    3.3491870515408837
of all people , it is the albanians , who are now being integrated into the transitional council , who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them .    4.902901982490492
in addition to financial UNK and reconstruction work , urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of serbs , albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the roma of course - in this country , so that at some point in the near future , on the road to coexistence , it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place .    4.111901079066126
i would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about .    3.716891766700811
administration - wise there are now 34 tax inspectors .    3.6665519600931846
that is excellent news !    3.293530815452924
there too , people are being encouraged to pay their taxes , for it will not do in the long - term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the eu and from other donors ; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources .    4.303963019364363
it should also be noted that of the 19 departments , 4 already have administrative leadership , which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto .    3.8275368744917757
there is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law . we have 130 judges and public prosecutors , who have now been UNK in , and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice , with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little , and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions .    4.41596226999566
another positive development i would like to remind you of is the fact that the old UNK is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country .    4.18326754586467
i wholly endorse what the committee on budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way .    4.137892601247747
the eu commission cannot pay for everything .    3.160557454877458
it is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the fourth pillar , but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay mr kouchner ' s outstanding bills .    4.024436614948067
one could do so once or twice , but i feel that the un donors should contribute to this as well , for there is a very large hole , as yet UNK , that we are unable to fill .    4.649538405164018
we have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it .    3.8802782075774704
mr president , i would like to offer a few explanations .    2.580758668641705
in a debate , there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said .    5.068803112398615
however , i would like to concentrate on two points .    3.0116004541603303
firstly , i would like to make it very clear that the union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of kosovo .    3.296325789283175
i would like to point out to mrs UNK that what we have read recently in the press is true , and that figures do not lie .    3.9489823066950125
let us make this clear , however much some people may not wish to believe it .    3.610947054187123
the union has decided to assist with a further eur 35 million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of kosovo , on the basis of an imf report which estimates that a further eur UNK million is needed for that reconstruction .    3.430044231365869
i would like to say to mrs pack that i am in complete agreement with her when she says that the commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments .    3.4954965519207555
i would also like to express my concern - which is very considerable - at the statement by some ministers at the last ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the portuguese presidency not to alter , in any circumstances , the financial perspectives agreed in berlin .    3.9192325011697946
this calls into question the agreement which parliament reached , with great difficulty , with the council in december , according to which , when the commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction , the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary .    4.385847103722003
i would like to appeal to those ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach .    3.187779570437607
i would like to ask the commission - and i am glad that commissioner solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme , with the corresponding report , requested by parliament , so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up , as we have been promised .    3.9006421514199068
lastly , i would like to insist that , although we have agreed to eur 35 million now , we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough , and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for kosovo , which is so badly needed .    4.017625170395346
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , please excuse my late arrival , but this other political issue is still on the agenda today , more is the pity .    2.9833802714493154
the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy would advise you to release the eur 35 million , and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need .    2.7813641116038377
the things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there .    3.571171586455523
however , this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process .    3.409576739833269
only then would we have been able to conduct proper and UNK discussions .    3.621755681132987
i urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future .    3.1302335281449505
it is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this .    4.309483452517784
however , we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here .    2.8814055932749247
one condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims .    4.031785008945706
in other words , we should ensure that the money falls to mr kouchner ' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres .    3.7977282831036883
secondly , even if the commission and the council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there , we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into .    4.0389658967105335
this mission is being conducted under the auspices of the united nations and we cannot have a situation where the european union is the only one to fulfil its obligations .    3.88166406935593
it is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe , in the interests of the persons affected .    3.950963170916438
this brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms , that is to say , not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south - east europe , and with the aid delivered there .    3.7767151153932814
this is another example of the fact that the european union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence .    3.8691512727347988
we have so many coordinators , who , in turn , are responsible to so many employers , that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators .    3.5992006606522966
perhaps it would be better , however , if the positions of responsibility within the european union and the other institutions from the osce to the united nations , were to get together some time to introduce a uniform , coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there .    4.425564711220264
i know that the commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this , but if the european union is doing the most work out there , then it should also be given the leadership , and bring coherence to the situation , so that we can be of real assistance to the people .    4.11118531325738
it makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground !    3.3846636988374597
bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of march - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline , that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented , and there is a steady stream of new press conferences , this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of europe !    4.0892376068779415
accordingly , we would like to take this opportunity to urge the commission and council presidency to seize this political initiative , so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our UNK at the end of a month . rather , we must use this initiative to establish a long - term aid strategy for this country , and i hope that in the process , you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months .    4.430441265179798
if the alliance is still active in that region , it is with the same objective .    4.305604199338178
the day before yesterday i was pleased to hear an interview given by the kfor commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in kosovo were starting to be , particularly as regards security , crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level .    3.4090160154028957
those representing europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective , and i am thinking in particular of the special representative of the secretary - general of the united nations , are on the UNK of UNK precisely because , since matters are improving , there is less talk of kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent .    3.587205702100682
it is true that economic aid is , in this respect , certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level .    3.4936052737955183
let me reiterate the comment which UNK pack has just made and stress that we , the members of the european parliament , must fulfil our own obligations in this regard , while ensuring , of course , that we are not the only ones to do so .    3.9297844432326787
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , mr brok , for his report .    2.512910148620768
if the council had worked as quickly as mr brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on .    4.090809234719041
the rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random .    3.6278558473092772
i would particularly like to draw your attention to amendment no 5 at this point , which clearly emphasises that it is only possible , and permissible , to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi - public , communal and other authorities and institutions , which are controlled either directly or indirectly by unmik .    3.3664731893976776
commissioner , it must be made clear that we support unmik and the institutions set up by the united nations , in particular pillar 4 of course , and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in kosovo and are still in place .    4.95627859464989
what is to be done with this money ?    3.8492142290954616
i would like to highlight the issue of human rights .    2.629642399388106
the west fought for human rights in kosovo and what is happening there today ?    4.974612235720906
we were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the serbs but almost every day UNK things happen : people are killed , people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit .    2.8294363517767755
every single day there are attacks on serbs , on the roma , on bosnians , but attacks are also still carried out on albanians .    3.495977777667581
i was in fact shocked to read in the report , assuming this is true , how an albanian doctor , who was working in the hospital in the serbian quarter of mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties , ultimately had to give up helping his UNK in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life .    3.4287164802402414
these are events and situations that cannot be tolerated .    3.070697437230432
there are , at the very least , rumours that serbian militias are up to their old UNK again .    3.4706105519975865
it is irrelevant , as far as i am concerned , as to whether it is serbs , roma , bosnians or albanians who are threatened or killed in kosovo .    3.1426452884083584
what is all - important , to my mind , is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve , a multi - ethnic kosovo that is , a kosovo where people can live together .    3.743251117452345
we need more police officers , as we have nowhere near enough .    3.3813558095083063
we need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish - , we also need funds for the office of high commissioner for human rights .    3.406171109015238
all of this needs to happen , and quickly too .    3.183276988789125
if we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise .    3.0370824835147157
that is why i believe that we were right to take action quickly , to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available .    4.0818240501982075
only , now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in kosovo , and i would urge the commission to see that these funds are put to good use , notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary .    4.447428277668062
. ( es ) mr president , i would like firstly to thank the members , and especially the rapporteur , for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue .    3.871253940117727
this will no doubt allow us to release the funds for kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both mr swoboda and mrs pack have mentioned .    3.852568054492079
i think i have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight ' s debate .    3.1766764941172165
firstly , although much progress has been made , and we could mention customs administration , bank administration or tax administration , it is true that we must continue to move forward .    3.9854735188761814
however , in moving forward , what should we be financing ?    3.2294567052437766
this is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement .    3.4029331298267076
in some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with union funds , for example , amendments nos 3 and 5 .    3.568930988362698
in our view , however , in both respects , greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the united nations which , on the ground , is more aware of the reality than we are .    4.423163461773228
we believe that to prejudge , at the moment , where resources should be directed , would create more practical difficulties .    3.470143758178536
in short , we should put our faith in those parties who , in these areas , are better equipped than us to make certain decisions .    3.971073577904611
the second concern which i notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by mr bourlanges , but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors .    3.880763642423077
is the commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate ?    3.3023099503356854
for example , amendments nos 1 , 2 and 4 .    2.6567981770516855
i would say to mr bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue , that this is not the fundamental problem , although we recognise it totally .    4.394541167265248
the fundamental problem is that , at the moment , the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the high level steering group , but it is also true that they have no legal status . this is simply a political commitment .    4.205132535987967
that is the reason why , while accepting its spirit , we would ask that amendment no 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to mr brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of community resources .    4.1041390927318355
i would say the same about amendment no 2 , which we would also accept with a slight modification , since the idea seems to us to be basically correct .    3.9084251077660355
amendment no 4 is of a similar nature .    3.462481629241475
on this specific point , we can perhaps offer mr bourlanges greater satisfaction .    3.5218524636567605
we have already spoken to the council so that it might include a commission statement in its decision , establishing this element of conditionality .    3.9517238245568254
with regard to the second contribution , what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors .    3.6990502845480853
in other words , we should not establish conditionality , or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start , but , nevertheless , we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage .    4.450291591124193
in this way , we would have no problem in acting immediately . we would not create problems for the kosovar people , but , on the other hand , we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing .    4.478750984499651
a third problem has been raised by mrs dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes .    3.7252394936258177
i would remind you that these projects are multiannual .    3.0252769732075233
the programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account .    3.9898669650408296
lastly , i would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us .    3.481395152923935
on the one hand , we have been asked to provide parliament with information regarding the progress of invitations to tender and , in this respect , i can tell you that the commission was last week able to provide parliament ' s committee on budgets with the latest statement of contracts and payments carried out since the task force was sent into action in kosovo .    3.6607553108499333
the commission can commit itself to regularly informing parliament of the invitations to tender which are published .    2.904482861702478
we also wish to see these publicised on the internet , so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point .    4.112489110631095
a second point which i would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance .    3.978465626275494
in this respect i would like to tell you that the commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed , on a confidential basis , if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality , on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance .    4.27864211866123
thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , and i hope that , with the final decision of the council , we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in kosovo by different parties , so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see .    3.9220739599304295
mr president , i am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between parliament , particularly the committee on budgets , and the commission , and we can assure you that , for our part , we shall always be there to assist the commission in the performance of its duties .    4.328342065500601
i do , however , have one small concern , when i hear the commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the committee on budgets .    3.91783074117226
but , if i understand what mr solbes mira says correctly , then this undertaking was only a UNK one .    3.6417787858857986
commissioner , an agreement is an agreement .    3.633956138609896
can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the committee on budgets , yes or no ? or are you going to drop this proviso , thus breaking the undertaking made to us ?    3.132297219273223
no , mr bourlanges , i think it is a substantive problem .    3.915558280425225
the problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted .    3.470292136630056
what i proposed to you , and what i still say , is that the commission will make a statement , in the council decision , something like this :    5.787150325935267
the exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in kosovo ' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors .    3.493660946268828
with this , we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed .    5.121539275920296
i am simply asking the commission to come and inform the committee on budgets before implementing the second tranche .    4.339517625701624
i agree , absolutely . we shall do so .    3.4628226669740605
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.7835196827501634
altener    5.316382251092326
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0011 / 2000 ) by mr langen , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the community - altener ( c5 - 0333 / 1999 - 1997 / 0370 ( cod )    1.8635053865466567
mr president , i would like to thank mr langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in parliament and in the council .    3.0912844965676007
the project has been long and problematic .    3.537885010891329
in future too , there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources .    3.7286251832919644
although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .    3.813808292311688
one example is the use of peat .    3.8221508010914804
peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels .    3.1872799324273053
if peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non - fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned .    3.934738682269215
it is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as , for example , coal .    3.7197779993561837
the development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the union ' s dependence on imported energy .    3.5140081849212113
research is particularly essential with regard also to the eu ' s next round of enlargement .    4.093381387842991
dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many eastern european countries , whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the soviet union on russian energy .    3.093967599821844
the eu must adhere to the kyoto protocol on climate .    2.95296862881596
we are all concerned about the environment and our children ' s future .    3.550655715125545
the share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased , but it has to be done in a rational manner .    3.810628036105948
we have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come .    3.095634194158394
for that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate : nuclear energy .    3.8430039497834643
mr president , on behalf of the pse group , i welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the altener ii programme .    3.420497189919691
firstly , however , i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur , mr langen , for the truly excellent work he has done on this report .    3.264726646292684
i would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the conciliation committee , mr provan .    3.2345282963845197
for as mr langen said just now , we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the conciliation committee .    3.6326691640356503
however , we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the UNK of the european parliament throughout .    4.322273827438482
mr langen mentioned that a series of parliament ' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the council halfway on even the most contentious point , that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the community .    3.318179539814946
this is not satisfactory - i would like to make that quite clear .    3.7893687965155545
however , we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed .    3.921919425965526
for in the course of the next few years , the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double , accounting for at least 12 % of energy consumption .    3.5874107276853997
this is the european union ' s declared aim .    3.368804015577953
that being the case , since altener is the only eu programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources , it will certainly be have a key role .    3.837613401846654
in the first place , this new five - year programme will entail extending the actions in the altener i programme . this will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector , developing local and regional energy agencies , and establishing new networks for approving financial support , to name but a few examples .    3.354532109592236
to my mind though , what is particularly important about the altener ii programme are the new actions for UNK market UNK by renewable energies and those for implementing , supporting and monitoring the community strategy and the community action plan .    3.900045271079967
we now have available to us a working paper from the commission ' s services on a breakthrough campaign , which is in fact a crucial element of this community strategy .    4.240763440431032
it contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors .    4.29354917137464
it is very important for this altener programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it .    2.9023649245209047
the overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately eur 30 billion .    2.913492493739699
75 % - 80 % of this is to come from private sources , and this will be supplemented by public funds from the member states and from the regions .    4.790559052664289
in this respect , the altener programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs .    3.9951900973229884
mr president , commissioner , i would like to thank mr langen for his excellent work in this important matter .    2.675193385097982
the conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the altener programme as put forward by the conciliation committee is , after all the difficult phases it has been through , at least satisfactory .    4.326218791224501
most of parliament ' s amendments have been taken into account and the fact that the programme has seen its total funding rise to eur 77 million must be seen as positive .    3.6621365811238626
the union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .    3.5734066865033047
there is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets , however .    3.5138869157831807
the appropriations are needed for pilot projects , research , information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy .    3.312077685475224
the main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the member states .    3.59192493583953
this programme will hopefully encourage member states to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy .    3.497896755445405
however , in the future , the union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market .    3.806138266023215
promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment .    4.167829174078396
the union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up .    2.9292401151630205
renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use UNK competitiveness .    3.3968047415663674
europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy .    3.6802845233951733
we should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment .    3.1483659392019114
may i also venture to raise the matter of peat ?    3.790791052481575
peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources .    3.785376006956263
however , it is important , at least in finland , as a UNK used , slowly renewable energy source .    4.0990851362083625
i hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables .    4.214686224994272
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the group of the greens / european free alliance are pleased with the agreement which has been found , and their thanks go to all those who negotiated so well in favour of an amendment which the greens were almost the authors of .    3.6394422345404047
it is interesting for me , as a new member of parliament , to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco UNK .    3.968938790405825
this is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale .    3.318354715380128
in contrast with that , i see the amounts allocated for renewable energies , which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion .    3.80791632556614
seeing the market share that small countries such as denmark have been capable of UNK in this field , because they were the first ones to develop that area , gives one food for thought , i feel , and i think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies .    4.227518110145401
one last word regarding the programme . i think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there .    4.633108615332095
in order to ensure that at least 50 % of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources , it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term .    4.03745283361536
mr president , may i commence by complimenting mr langen on his work .    2.434606871016993
the activities of the altener programme will promote renewable energy sources and i believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future .    3.3507138190397416
for this reason , i am particularly pleased to see the monies UNK on projects by small and medium - sized enterprises .    3.0422144204561494
the internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone .    3.408182797927417
in this regard , it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit .    3.022176922461841
it is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables .    3.093589089021031
i am pleased that ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend UNK million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector .    3.8120354994948564
i would hope that the contribution of altener would lead to more initiatives .    3.5160250935084294
as the final text rightly states , actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities .    3.24449044023288
i can UNK that i have already received significant interest in the altener programme from my own constituency of leinster , a significant portion of which falls within ireland ' s only objective i region .    3.476267924907668
i support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector .    3.63207831670402
in short , we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the kyoto protocol , while at the same time promoting growth in our economies .    2.89620482044858
altener will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the member states .    3.9788303604542845
mr president , mr langen , ladies and gentlemen , as our rapporteur mentioned , we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the council on the altener programme .    3.996951095098023
mr langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the council was initially ff 74 million , whereas the commission proposed 81 . 1 million , a figure which the european parliament supported .    4.1605178385717405
an initial conciliation meeting was not successful , because the council would not at that time accept an increase of eur 1 . 9 million .    3.592260025377878
we could not agree with a proposal like this , which challenged the authority of the european parliament .    4.056193763586468
a second round of conciliation achieved an increase of eur 1 . 1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million .    3.328030357658014
in spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal , personally , once again i deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the council in this situation is in UNK contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply , job creation and environmental protection , challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to .    4.189074372478819
in fact , renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives .    3.371604281649347
however , in spite of the reservations i am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation , i personally support the compromise , by virtue of the programme ' s content , to which the european parliament made an active contribution as , following the entry into force of the amsterdam treaty , this sector become subject to codecision .    3.6119999979503445
it is practically certain that , with the raft of proposed measures and actions , it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12 % renewable energy share by 2010 , UNK the current rate , as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available .    3.7188810315519603
this programme , together with the save ii programme , integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy , establishes a foundation for a real community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence .    3.1492359411112694
and , in conclusion , mr president , let me also insist upon the fact that , in addition to the measures proposed , there are also legislative measures and , most especially , adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives .    4.176972742366473
and i shall end , of course , by congratulating mr langen , our rapporteur , on his work , as well as all the members of the committee and of the conciliation committee .    5.098524616368178
. ( es ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the altener ii programme in the conciliation committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and , of course , point out that this agreement will allow the altener programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme .    3.6535188419533595
all of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the save programme , which we will be discussing soon .    4.331883763178489
i would like to say that the work carried out during this time by parliament has been of a high quality , and i therefore congratulate the rapporteur , mr langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary .    3.977948617944812
obviously , there have been arguments , we had to go to conciliation , as the rapporteur and mr UNK reminded us a moment ago , since at the first meeting no result was achieved , and there had to be a second meeting , despite the fact that the figures were not excessive .    4.4425268851606505
however , i believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement , which , like all agreements , is perhaps not perfect , but which , i believe , allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing .    4.61002771144689
i would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur , mr langen , on his work , to thank the speakers and , of course , to acknowledge the actions of vice - president provan throughout the conciliation procedure , who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result .    3.3933873011680027
i would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the council .    3.1502774022180433
save    5.277118384948479
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0010 / 2000 ) by mrs ahern , on behalf of the european parliament delegation to the conciliation committee , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european and council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of energy efficiency - save ( c5 - 0334 / 1999 - 1997 / 0371 ( cod ) .    1.9642227375204053
madam president , i would like to thank the council and commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good - UNK all round , which is not always the case .    3.434628603092453
i am happy to say that i can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re - worded form .    3.395684417042277
the financial amount finally allocated to the programme is also a considerable improvement on the council ' s proposal at second reading which we found completely unacceptable and we have made quite a lot of progress there .    4.579722801290421
i therefore propose that this house agree to adopt the proposals on save and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading .    3.370079740713255
i would like to remind the house that at second reading parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments , including a re - UNK of the commission ' s original budget .    3.358253208490063
the commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and i thank the commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the council had proposed was unacceptable .    3.629792703914599
during the procedure , agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise , implement , complement and assess the community measures .    3.276238831307848
compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non - legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and , very importantly , the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency .    3.675609505963279
i hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .    4.281239905140272
the issue of the financial UNK was staunchly defended by parliament in the face of the council ' s very meagre opening offer .    4.407560608641508
in the event we had to have several meetings before the council finally increased this to a substantial amount .    3.6221872332542375
we got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which i can recommend to you and which the commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under .    4.299050353762304
this was an important consideration for us .    3.3894581922390032
i would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real .    4.351357653844822
funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the member states .    2.960517072479645
we have to bear that in mind when approving this programme .    3.0988535986510946
if there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at community level , this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action , including community actions , on energy saving .    4.104391385062191
where the community can step in is to put the local UNK in touch with each other so that they can actually not re - UNK the UNK in every region .    4.03860855427333
we have an important part to play in the community in the european union in this regard .    4.738686311789054
save is the only community - wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy .    3.946526626646825
it focuses on non - technical elements , helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure , and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted .    4.247796675770469
we have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business , saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non - UNK .    3.5157707071652484
it is something that we can all support .    3.796166937770734
i have to say , like motherhood , although we all support it , sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the UNK or the people engaged in energy - saving .    3.4588451275913568
we could do rather more , considering that we have made great commitments in reducing co2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports .    3.5394264914720406
we are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see .    3.946175954265893
we are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change .    3.3934423978158907
if we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .    3.9412230567088997
i would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process .    2.567729015946527
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i would once again like to thank mrs ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal , since she has contributed , in collaboration with the other members , to the achievement of a very reasonable final result , which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the commission itself and , of course , on what , from a budgetary point of view , the council had initially accepted .    3.9822211896334156
as mrs ahern has explained very well , the budgets of both the save programme and the altener programme , are basically symbolic budgets , since the burden is UNK by the countries , the states of the union , the regions or even , in some cases , the local authorities .    4.204698195705563
however , despite the fact that the volume is relatively small , it is nevertheless UNK important that there is a common desire throughout the community as a whole to support this type of action , which contributes to our genuine compliance with the kyoto commitments . this action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources , greater safety in our energy supplies and , in the case of save , to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy , thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set .    4.031108473118498
furthermore , behind these programmes , that is to say , the save programme , which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings , and the altener programme , which concerns renewable energy , there lies an extremely important technological challenge , which , from an economic point of view , may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the union as a whole .    3.839654494589955
with regard to the parliamentary procedure , i would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken , especially the rapporteur , because the majority of parliament ' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the council , in this case practically all of them , although with some modifications . i would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved .    4.025477022092883
this improvement has been achieved with fresh funds , as we said at the time , and it has been achieved while safeguarding this parliament ' s UNK and competences .    4.995768597210183
i would like once again to thank all the speakers , and also , especially , the vice - president , mr provan , for his magnificent work throughout this debate , particularly during the conciliation procedure , as well as the chairman of the committee on industry and , also , above all , the rapporteur , mrs ahern , and all the members who have participated in this work .    3.8401398795439188
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.7835196827501634
culture 2000    4.670093199179111
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0009 / 2000 ) by mr graça moura , on behalf of the european parliament delegation to the conciliation committee , on the joint text approved by the conciliation committee for a european parliament and council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ( ' culture 2000 ' ) ( c5 - 0327 / 1999 - 1998 / 0169 ( cod ) .    1.8614334851204137
madam president , i actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate .    3.9716196091714626
unfortunately , there has been no change in the way that the council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it .    3.61560960181581
we have the feeling , and are in fact convinced , that the member states would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the treaty of maastricht .    4.229106034526861
for no one is very keen to spend money on culture .    3.6289379997020954
sadly that is the case and we must face facts .    5.6232572422906415
i would like to thank the rapporteur , who really has chipped away UNK at this UNK task , in conjunction with the commissioner of course .    3.0334789459938003
we simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content , of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect .    4.576253738800205
one seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind , where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision .    3.956867451645275
what kind of horse - trading system is this ?    3.0153450775677015
certainly not a fair one ! there are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side , UNK for a little more money for culture .    4.406810354878306
it is downright scandalous what goes on !    3.0015025953035797
it is an awful sort of horse - trading , based on unequal positions !    2.920349451834976
nevertheless , we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to .    4.377628380146901
it lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us .    3.879259385386722
we will support small and medium - sized events , not the large ones , and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access .    3.991320418489992
i believe that the fact that culture and , UNK , education and youth now fall within the same commissioner ' s remit , will also serve to guarantee more synergy between these three programmes , which are certainly worthwhile programmes for the citizens of the european union .    4.025467794867004
if one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied , but then only a tiny bit .    3.2867873465152337
it is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money .    3.9891388990806114
madam president , i agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and i must add that , during the conciliation procedure , i was personally a little disappointed with the council .    3.8883131959752064
on the one hand , it continued to refuse to accept the term " european cultural policy " or other similar terms , even UNK the terms of the treaty , and it defines " culture 2000 " simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more .    3.544986330904365
on the other hand , it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this parliament , which were minimal anyway .    3.7435582373373513
incidentally , this last point would be unfair to fourteen members of the council , since it was just one , the netherlands , which was responsible for that intransigence .    4.086222251999185
this demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution .    3.294632944333547
however , madam president , these considerations must not hide the fact that the joint text which we will vote on tomorrow , and which the socialists will vote in favour of , will put in place one of the european union ' s most important programmes .    4.900706945586664
by taking action in the field of culture , we are directly contributing to the construction of a european soul , especially given the fact that the sub - programmes which make up " culture 2000 " are superb .    4.334350650587316
in recent years , these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the UNK and most dynamic citizens of the european union .    3.5046120594036547
lastly , i would like to mention the profoundly human impression i have formed of the rapporteur , mr graça moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual qualities , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have had .    3.0735097409998837
finally , i would like to congratulate commissioner reding , vice - president imbeni and mr gargani , chairman of the committee on culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintained during the entire conciliation process .    3.321060797933533
madam president , commissioner , rapporteur , i would like to start by thanking mr graça moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this culture 2000 programme .    3.2064824949940265
it has been said before , and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions , that culture is , of course , extremely important as an area unto itself - i would like to stress this once again - but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the european idea .    3.692754444878583
it is also of great importance to citizens .    3.5174220745007228
we should , above all , not lose sight of this . the impetus given to the european idea by this programme is having an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic areas such as the netherlands which not only has national potential , but is also relying on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view .    4.123031345877823
today , we have arrived at the end of a long road .    3.0781136024251463
i would nonetheless like , as others have done , to touch upon the procedure , which is unclear and , above all , unwanted .    4.224389857672406
codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand .    3.3724136477074484
they are like a snake UNK its own UNK .    3.3634636066146633
there is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand : anything is open for discussion , as long as the budget UNK fixed .    3.6826396873722516
as it happens - and i would like to add this for the sake of the netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage .    4.122384685522595
the result is 30 % growth , so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result .    3.8664865654681404
of course , it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and i for one will always advocate this - but i do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes .    4.05737963773883
i would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular UNK .    3.211213718014881
culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas .    3.4464676476092246
a great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the structural funds , and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind .    3.419497561808537
fortunately , i am on the committee on regional policy .    4.705867646728752
so i myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention .    3.32630522211958
i think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because , if it happens to be cancelled , then surely this does not benefit the citizen .    4.137878629541591
however , i do think that it is necessary , as he always states too , that , in the next igc , changes will be made to codecision , when unanimity will no longer be necessary .    4.484032530681834
we are very positive about the many improvements which have been made : no more UNK - projects , room for cultural networks , and sufficient attention to promoting reading , UNK and translation companies .    3.707860614176338
this is especially important to smaller linguistic areas . i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also mrs reding for culture 2000 .    3.184825082240954
all that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .    3.6017109705765917
madam president , all that i wanted to say has been covered by those fellow members who spoke before me and i think there is unanimity among the groups in the european parliament and among those of us on the committee on culture .    4.382922101663675
i too must say that i will be voting for this joint text for a council and european parliament decision with a very heavy heart .    4.198428766541801
not because our delegation , our rapporteur and the chairman mr gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because i have any strong objection to commissioner reding ' s attitude - i think that , given the framework she was operating in , her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the council .    3.6381162447804356
that figure of eur 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the european union !    4.28432742185814
when we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups , young UNK , pioneering activities in the arts , writers , to humiliate them and send them UNK with a UNK on the back and thirty rejection UNK in such a way that they begin to perceive europe as something foreign , something opposed , contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the european union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro , not just enlargement , nor geostrategic UNK , but also to encourage culture to UNK in this affair of european unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end .    3.6657654591039934
   3.7318943719743674
   3.7318943719743674
so long as we continue to have unanimity , so long as yesterday the dutch government was able to impose those eur 167 million as an UNK and so long as a government with mr haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue , we will never progress .    3.878759276688299
that is why it is very important for the intergovernmental conference to take important decisions and to cut free so that the european parliament ' s efforts to create a meaningful cultural impetus within the european area may be rid of this constraint by all the governments .    3.992377577375732
madam president , i absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and i would also like to thank the chairman of the committee on culture , mr gargani , for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also , considerably difficult .    3.640035821777797
of course , we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes , but everyone hoped that the culture programme could help to promote , for example , the unique features of each cultural sector , even - and i could say especially - of the unique features of less well - known sectors .    3.9543121750563
we hope that this , at the least , will come about during the evaluation process .    3.870291986300279
we sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action , among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social , as well as economic , development of a people .    4.727843345248247
and a fully - fledged europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully UNK its roots , highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well - known .    3.0181541442513264
as for the important educational task which the european union must carry out as regards culture , one of the programme ' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the council at least - certainly not the commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action : the document which UNK the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this .    4.141547384978558
madam president , i will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that i support the adoption of culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , mr graça moura , who took over from our former colleague UNK UNK .    3.446145018745016
both of them have done a first - class job .    3.7659200178647927
alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day , culture may not seem that important , but it is ; and we have to be careful in the european parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important .    5.015537921099105
where would europe ' s tourism industry be without the richness of our culture ?    3.502097049398599
but , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised .    3.4905062712489885
culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs ; and an UNK society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy .    3.887483356212851
cultural diversity is important , and it is under threat .    4.671620500412033
however , it is not under threat from europe .    3.4287077213020236
many people in my country say they see british culture being under threat , for example , from portugal , from germany , from finland , for heaven ' s sake .    3.722638476093438
we do drink port wine , and we do like german beer , and we even use finnish UNK , but it is not from europe that culture is under threat .    4.212424477363499
what i do see right across europe is people drinking UNK UNK , eating UNK , wearing UNK UNK , watching UNK UNK and often doing all this at the same time .    3.7758297863747465
now i do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending europe ' s culture , but i do believe in lending a helping hand when we can .    4.392332279572763
that is what culture 2000 is about .    2.8008810145375884
so , i say to the council of ministers : keep this programme genuinely under review .    3.910042820995838
are we doing enough ?    3.175414411665121
and , i say to madame reding , thank you for the support and the help you have given so far , keep up the good work , we are on your side .    4.387455552339378
madam president , i too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur , UNK moura , and commissioner reding , for their contribution to the creation of this programme .    3.3686454897614495
the culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between parliament and the council .    3.689654869805165
the outcome can be considered reasonable , when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the council .    4.668228442866374
we have to hope that at the forthcoming igc we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture .    4.410322558325552
it is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the council .    3.5394387729717436
when implementation of the programme begins , i hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full . i believe and hope that , despite the UNK on us all of the new technology , literature will maintain its status .    4.39044089540402
we need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial .    2.973388030627612
literature likewise plays an important part in the way it UNK our cultural heritage , increases mutual familiarity and UNK linguistic wealth and the diversity of UNK .    3.966354971273938
in this connection , i am very glad to say that soon after the UNK and culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the council of ministers in march in lisbon , the country holding the presidency of the eu is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries .    4.39671859035566
i hope that this conference will also encourage the commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society .    3.535523528470331
madam president , commissioner , rapporteur , ladies and gentlemen , somehow or other , today ' s agenda has come full circle .    3.265468599975801
we have had a great deal to say today about europe as a community of values , about tolerance , human dignity , human rights , a positive approach to the enlargement process , transparency and respect for each other .    3.935877645105939
youth , education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values , for giving the citizens confidence in the european union and making it credible in their eyes .    3.649653949194236
the funding approved by the council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the european union ' s goals .    4.398994734506508
cultural activity is an expression of individuality , of an individual ' s own personality ; it UNK relationships and UNK .    3.7439965321964426
we want a UNK europe .    3.016239746083511
we want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences .    3.3494337556926683
that is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget , the allocation of funds that is , into the different types of measure .    4.08994808917124
that is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures , because we want to promote the small and medium - sized entities and activities performed by individuals ; because we want to see thousands of flowers UNK .    3.2592723697194894
i would like to second what the previous speaker had to say .    3.3205796821962217
there is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle , codecision procedure , and conciliation committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen , and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a european consciousness .    4.164342124903955
madam president , as we have heard , all the groups have a common political enemy in the council .    3.53644298627434
it is not by chance that the committee on culture ' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure , for one or other member state in the council always holds culture hostage to other interests .    3.8926889463950665
in this way , the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a UNK instrument of the first order .    3.847136576810827
the battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years , and now , at long last , the european parliament can give the go - ahead .    3.5494732349280778
the council could not be moved , not even when the UNK programmes kaleidoscope , ariane and raphael finished .    3.32695149742126
a pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap .    3.2299003042057124
this showed up the weaknesses of the european union ' s cultural policy activities once again .    3.524135256371079
the political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support .    3.127674760850165
out of UNK applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of eur 6 . UNK million could be considered .    3.378593848214565
the council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate parliament to the tune of even a single euro !    3.470029789570861
and so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004 .    2.7442447906780236
that is the same as a single , medium - sized , german UNK house ' s expenditure over the same period , when here in europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years !    3.11042204645676
there is a blatant discrepancy here !    3.172945753202665
and so we are going to have to be content , albeit very grudgingly , with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content .    4.244715201786227
previous speakers have already UNK pointed this out .    3.765090439482202
perhaps the council will come to understand that cultural activities do the european union good , not harm !    5.081064676423242
cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be .    3.5933155127822607
providing support for culture meets with wide - spread acceptance , and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions .    3.9335804082323165
what , may i ask , is the council afraid of ?    4.258251501896905
madam president , whoever has the honour , like myself , to chair the committee on culture , cannot fail to agree with the comments from various members and can but congratulate the rapporteur , and commissioner reding , with whom he worked and who , even during the conciliation process , had difficult moments and opposed the council - you have heard this said by everyone .    3.661197701546457
i have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at european organisational level has been firmly asserted , but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the european states will make .    4.063471632946425
i shall simply stress my own personal complaint because , in the end , we did not manage to adopt a review clause .    3.7447412485408216
however , mrs reding was certainly receptive and UNK , and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years , and therefore to change the situation .    4.290757647442946
the cultural programmes launched in years past - kaleidoscope , ariane and raphael - are being replaced by a single programme , culture 2000 , where - and i must stress this here very forcefully - the rapporteur censures a position which should give the european parliament cause for reflection - as someone said this afternoon - but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor .    3.650783444675701
this is not rhetoric , but the new UNK of a modern liberalism which unites the european states and constitutes a turning point for the european parliament and the commission .    3.9496819345999588
we agree with this approach and despite the lack of funds , this evening ' s result will serve to greatly boost this strategy and this opportunity for europe , which will then give rise to an economic factor and a growth factor ; culture then , and an institutional aspect , the basis for structuring a vast community , a prerequisite for economic growth , and not the complete opposite , as europe , in its cultural UNK , has perhaps been used to viewing things in the past .    4.040964451944921
man and culture are priorities , and culture can result in economic growth .    3.638278101734534
let us UNK this result , derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy .    2.726574544244515
madam president , may i first thank mr graça moura for UNK his way through the rather tough UNK and UNK that have made up this conciliation UNK .    3.5087390142038157
it seems to me when entering the conciliation process for culture 2000 , having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate .    3.27014075827094
again , because these UNK are not entirely straight forward , we have to thank vice - president imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our community .    3.5842100160168378
the fundamental question , it seems to me , that faces this parliament , the commission and the council is : what is europe ?    4.371064457514592
what does it mean and what does europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries ?    3.1547072946560832
europe is its people , its history and now its collectivity ; but the reason why culture 2000 is so important to us is for this : i will wager that when we ask the question - ' what is europe ? ' - we answer it by saying , ' it is our art , it is our literature and it is our heritage . '    4.305090111631021
that is what culture 2000 represents .    2.6840394433901107
it represents the possibility of sustaining a european identity in the twenty - first century , an identity which UNK the echoes of division , of war , of poverty , of opportunity , of poverty UNK la UNK .    3.3743638695878904
and more than this - and this is more UNK , madam president , it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive , that are cross - cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require .    4.046758644488555
it promotes mobility , and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded .    3.7290244036248428
my only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver .    3.3546459579180765
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we have now come to the end of a long road .    3.126382030234546
following the conciliation stage , our institutions can now formally adopt the new ' culture 2000 ' framework programme .    3.1711200259047434
we shall thus , in the course of the next five years , have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear , well - structured and , i am sure , successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector .    4.00451392951413
it is with great satisfaction that i today welcome this ' happy ending ' in this house , and i thank you for it .    3.625086018176501
i wish to thank everyone in this parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process .    4.17538823579407
i should like to express UNK thanks to the committee on culture , youth , education , the media and sport , particularly to its rapporteur , mr graça moura , its chairman , mr gargani , the european parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups , the conciliation committee and its chairman , mr imbeni .    3.6126950077128215
they all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution .    3.3279686910845863
throughout the negotiations , they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally UNK negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time .    3.7181794331456777
we now have a framework programme , the first of its type for the cultural sector , and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive , but also more thorough and detailed manner .    4.47191716481098
i would like to express my delight , with you , at this pleasing outcome . in spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions , these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and i would like to pick up on what mr gargani has just said , that the commission made a statement regarding a mid - term assessment .    3.615401769709343
it stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with article 7 of the european parliament and council decision , it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme , and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the community financial perspectives .    5.0343733256235685
if need be , the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision , and this should be achieved by 30 june 2002 .    4.381847199147714
ladies and gentlemen , this is a formal commitment , not just words on paper .    4.215130220353395
all this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area , within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features , in all their diversity , but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of europe may participate fully in them .    3.9201178140486643
it is thanks , too , to parliament ' s action , preferring a number of small - scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens ' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale .    4.37338089274265
this is going to lead us to make ' culture 2000 ' the programme of the citizen .    3.9029370604622726
the increased participation of our citizens is something i hope and pray for . i would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and i undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality .    4.655374667907785
i know that you , as members of parliament , in your own regions and countries , are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers , as one member of parliament said , go to make a vast UNK carpet .    4.382789031483341
i should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens , both in personal as well as in social and economic terms , but a right which it is our job to assert , and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the union .    4.239951484962726
this is what our european ' culture 2000 ' programme offers .    2.888709263276676
it does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various member states .    3.4759554941333466
such policies are necessary , and i would like to see them developed further .    4.052141561753688
it simply adds to them , complements them , building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries .    3.3961635136894546
i feel therefore that extending and enriching european citizens ' participation in culture is a crucial task , one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it , and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our union .    3.7925143769492355
a number of members of parliament have quite rightly raised this point . if the union is purely an economic union , then it is a UNK project .    4.0899911387713
however , if it is a union of culture , civilisation and participation , then it becomes a living thing .    3.982165822350587
this is the foundation , ladies and gentlemen , which i intend to develop , and i shall take the following five areas into special consideration : firstly , providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their UNK to find the support it deserves in our programme .    3.862653494907357
secondly , encouraging exchanges , mobility and training in the cultural sector .    2.869716157983306
thirdly , promoting cooperation between cultural operators .    3.002684323471175
fourthly , increasing UNK for culture , with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and , fifthly , protecting the common cultural heritage on the european scale as well as the history of the peoples of europe , and making them better known .    3.6240098221543353
the new programme will , i am sure , in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency , efficiency and balance , prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures .    4.325141408493525
madam president , i reiterate my thanks to parliament for its support and for , once again , having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the union .    3.47922678428652
i am certain that it will not be disappointed , having given us its support , and i personally undertake to keep parliament informed , as things progress , of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens , which i hope will be great measures for the future of the union .    4.7283086237463765
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
i think we can also thank the rapporteur once again .    4.0093459057954135
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place at 11 a . m . tomorrow .    1.7835196827501634
( the sitting was closed at 9 . 55 p . m . )    2.18284699323068
end - of - life vehicles    4.02742778515582
the next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading ( a5 - 0006 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , on the common position established by the council with a view to the adoption of the european parliament and council directive on end - of - life vehicles [ 8095 / 1 / 1999 - c5 - 0180 / 1999 - 1997 / 0194 ( cod ) ] ( rapporteur : mr florenz )    2.391367256158295
mr president , nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in europe .    2.719002230829071
even though they can no longer be driven , these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders ; and not just intra - community borders , but also those outside the union .    3.5520957564392437
it is therefore only right that the european union should draw up community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed .    3.583429937353872
we believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the house should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground - breaking .    4.079621646932467
we therefore have a number of amendments .    3.94163810348842
i personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective .    4.579060697844192
i do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive .    3.5353297157598846
nor do i think that motorcycles should be included , as the distinctive culture of recycling within the UNK industry UNK the need for a european directive in this area .    4.373275330996658
i am not looking for such UNK high recycling quotas when it comes to special - purpose vehicles either .    3.0207408285008617
i want special - purpose vehicles such as UNK to have high recovery quotas .    3.3192874295525887
this is my main concern in this matter .    3.131280407066071
in my opinion , the directive solidly UNK the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in europe .    3.1480725700196235
this can be left as the commission has proposed with the member states ensuring the appropriate collection points for UNK cars .    4.215019797557205
this will involve , for example , disposing of more than 32 million UNK of used oil , removing break fluid , etc .    3.3382484579489753
an important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts .    4.142703634038572
what should we do with the shredded products ?    3.4594935335053227
we should not overlook the fact that , although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery , they are by no means the only point .    3.6873214759594375
do not forget that , in the case of cars , 80 % of environmental impact comes through driving , 1 % through recovery and 19 % through construction .    3.454411029664772
quotas are not , therefore , the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility , just one of many .    4.012459560201053
we must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars .    3.0478129668189546
i am far UNK to see us move away from today ' s car , weighing 1 , 400 kg and driving an average of 200 , 000 km , to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1 , 000 kg .    3.101484025693556
this would at least mean 400 kg times 200 , 000 km less transportation .    2.7100705662262037
this would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in co2 which , if i have rightly understood the kyoto protocol , is the important factor .    4.033793585239419
we therefore consider that , in future , vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less co2 and should receive preferential treatment in their UNK quotas .    3.0972009707977852
it should not be for each member state , but for you and your staff , commissioner , to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles ( and there is also talk of 3 - litre vehicles ) should receive preferential treatment .    3.8488550874947576
we think they should .    3.497910887551792
may i say something about costs .    3.2413658018947133
some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers ; that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer .    4.747720136602048
however , this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state - UNK monopoly on recycling .    3.314419328087617
i can only warn you against UNK to this .    3.22448013094548
there are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty - fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car .    2.4625178374381207
the money from this pool , system , or however you want to picture it , would mean that from 2006 all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder .    3.787237889308734
this too is a particular desire of my group .    3.2150422580744484
our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage , namely that we won ' t be an immediate candidate for the court of justice when the directive is adopted .    3.7484711599412357
the car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions , which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly .    4.064861526936505
this is why i propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer .    2.6310433249244185
as for a ban on certain materials : of course we need one !    3.4937975903875
a car has dangerous components which we must ban long - term .    3.8573812582507974
this means that we need a pressure instrument .    3.0834201894340545
the commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives .    3.7145739372610467
there are a number of sound amendments .    3.195613759156131
this parliament has been given more authority , so let us use it !    3.822358349449205
let us have the courage to put together a ground - breaking directive .    3.2800914260690073
a directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this house .    3.733905915558976
i ask for your support .    3.0888674886499015
mr president , i almost feel like saying , " UNK " , now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work , and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur , mr florenz .    4.3152736445235025
i do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which , today , can only be removed at local authority expense , i . e . the taxpayers ' expense .    3.891230073521397
the principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied .    2.4572769246977546
vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by community legislation , in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end - of - life vehicles .    3.865115236734512
the only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future .    4.318424350537457
it has not , however , been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle .    4.099833234146592
on the other hand , we can be fairly confident for the future because we know the efforts that car manufacturers are prepared to make in order to find ( a ) materials that are easier to recycle and ( b ) to set up recycling industries .    3.7795075940481655
i should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling , UNK and incineration , as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions .    3.337954353919181
this is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end - of - life vehicles and the former directives , including the one on auto - oil , which we voted on a few years ago .    3.6023315460586134
we must therefore congratulate the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , on having the wisdom , in order to make things perfectly clear , to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage .    2.9377824673443693
in conclusion , let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still UNK our forests , lakes and UNK .    3.6061760412559485
once again , the principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied . the taxpayer is still footing the bill .    2.6966511275371747
mr president , commissioner , reading the UNK which have been distributed in recent weeks , one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in europe .    3.9506506635219623
neither is correct .    3.5297428041382166
we simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive .    4.136302864585375
it means ecological progress for europe , and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion .    3.4842944278090258
all the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .    4.845145569484728
in the grand scheme of the directive , it is perhaps a minor point , but nevertheless a disputed one .    3.765735260609941
here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year ' s debate in the council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs .    3.4490573553382156
last february in this house we UNK decided ( and we social democrats are UNK to this ) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question !    3.7230750497151046
so who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of ?    3.849940261187052
for us this is straightforward : in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars .    3.7585099783713187
and what about vehicles which are already on the road ?    3.3700815745971813
let us look at an example . rover in great britain , if they were responsible for all end - of - life cars , would actually be responsible for 5 . 8 million cars within the european union and would immediately have to set aside eur 250 million against recycling costs , whereas a manufacturer from korea building similar cars would only have to shell out UNK , as a representative of deutsche bank put it .    3.3735630105924406
such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection ; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in europe .    2.9090755294937303
consequently , for end - of - life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end - of - life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs .    3.573077850405461
i can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full UNK and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds .    3.775156754682155
however , i would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than 2 million people who make a living from building cars in europe , so that these jobs can be secured in the future .    3.6185125745873137
i am in favour of stringent environmental requirements , as you know from the auto - oil programme and the debate on UNK emissions , but i believe that they should be the same for everyone !    4.583495133835831
mr president , commissioner , i think we need this directive .    3.0000794004149194
firstly , because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives .    3.7823285968040983
secondly , because it can promote recycling , which is important .    4.952766113794987
thirdly , because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals .    3.748400055702691
this is also an important point .    2.9226276985671884
the directive affords a european framework , also to member states who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these .    4.310204483208463
so , first of all , we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level . this will , of course , provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of .    4.110087470486911
secondly , we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position .    3.383144536355738
as from 2006 , therefore , all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners .    3.4835940916553696
needless to say , this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way .    4.276896437450751
is this too much of a burden ?    3.4968439182224142
there is , however , one thing we should not overlook .    4.228954596576819
the directive applies to complete cars , that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing .    3.5608087227928467
according to the experts , few of these complete cars are of no value .    2.911019838121469
after all , recycling and the re - use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss - making .    3.8588980390591328
quite the reverse , in fact . at present , there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them , and a decent one at that .    3.939668507429417
this directive encourages the whole of this sector .    3.9879233342753926
it is a sector which comprises small and medium - sized businesses .    2.8282982941422414
since , in this case , transport costs are high , a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised , because transporting an end - of - life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity .    4.093176303149492
i think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles , and i think we ought to add this provision to it .    4.1424559971244665
i think , therefore , that vintage cars ought to be exempt .    3.4690824621047582
also , it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer .    4.2310152508316
that is a basic principle which we must uphold .    3.3905131771919543
we must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipulated in the common position .    3.1576380972945044
i find this a well - balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things .    3.525254969074931
i think we need to retain it .    3.347193835180544
this is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence .    4.14062344025656
after all , we are all aware how difficult it was within the council to bring this common position about , and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position .    4.212334526608205
in my opinion , we should not jeopardise that common position , because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons .    3.798443439708013
i would ask you to support this common position .    2.6552835086988695
our group will , at any rate , do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well - balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including , for example , the way in which the costs are to be distributed .    4.268840801032036
mr president , we need to take an important decision today .    3.2705333697586334
does this european parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer ' s liability , that is to say that cars , once they have reached the end of their lives , are the responsibility of the car manufacturer ?    4.173426016839247
no , according to the christian democrats in amendment no . 38 : car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50 / 50 .    3.1644608613683682
it is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50 / 50 compromise is included that this does not work .    3.242828845213778
packaging still accounts for a mountain of UNK in europe and is a burden upon the environment .    4.331569624249463
some of the socialists under the direction of mr bernd lange say : yes , we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to amendment no 45 .    3.3828095122370336
the common position stipulates 2006 .    2.8408475158679263
according to the group of the greens , this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations .    3.789002908218281
i would therefore urge my colleagues not to support amendment no 38 of the christian democrats and amendment no 45 of some of the socialists .    3.4187182335430086
if car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars , they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re - used more easily and more UNK .    3.3785070477455186
the problem of plastic and pvc will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant - based UNK .    3.066486282441221
this is ultimately cheaper , also for the consumer .    3.509360558027101
for twenty years , the majority within parliament has attempted to make european environmental policy UNK .    4.152409646662695
today , this green position is being threatened under pressure from , in particular , the german and french car industries .    3.5660268619992856
that is why i urge you to vote against amendments nos 38 and 45 .    2.999781187570917
we , the green group , by and large support the common position .    3.204254135917763
mr president , the waste from end - of - life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances .    2.957624286235891
we in the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area .    2.7585365630736134
with this directive , we have the chance to take a big step forward , but this presupposes that the council ' s position is not UNK to UNK and weakened in parliament ' s reading of it .    5.342697328934026
if they were adopted , many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive .    3.5428741835599746
this applies , above all , to amendments from the group of the european people ' s party but also , unfortunately , to some of the amendments from mr lange , as i see it .    4.08849203795992
it is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries , for example in germany , went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted .    3.5844004387263557
for ourselves , it is crucial that the following principles should apply .    4.180260420867796
the polluter should pay .    3.0058253159931514
this means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial as well as otherwise , for recycling vehicles .    3.9187893705980663
there must be rules governing existing vehicles too .    2.994048632630815
where this aspect is concerned , we cannot accept any weakening of the council ' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force .    4.262143827418218
there should be no falling - off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years , and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead .    3.758700693310589
we shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations .    3.0531987342340083
if those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive , this would be very detrimental , not only from an environmental point of view but also for the european parliament ' s credibility on environmental issues .    4.037079425379197
reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries , for example my own country , sweden .    4.951190485439771
i was myself a car worker before i was elected .    3.045743100779856
i believe i am one of the few members of this parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars .    3.6864376251266853
i think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry .    3.4696729266447894
these would , of course , be to the advantage of modern , progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms .    3.5490343270608324
it is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the european union .    3.7779067158712114
mr president , i am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this parliament , as indeed it is for the citizens of europe .    3.7145437777197614
there is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment .    2.6125431460472908
our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests .    3.8026797605798515
each year , there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the european union . this in itself generates a large amount of waste .    3.9007079652564256
car manufacturers , the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars .    3.3650216952552836
from an irish perspective , i know that the irish department of the environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in ireland in the near future to deal with end - of - life vehicles .    3.6841063776555565
car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re - use , recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years .    4.106594724162076
in accordance with new provisions included in the amsterdam treaty all the 370 million consumers within the european union have a right to consumer - related information .    3.871149494410245
i believe eu consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally - friendly practices in the coming year .    3.2445740018992604
my final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the european community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations .    4.339790582843251
i also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials , a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation .    3.734843825039536
in this regard , we are certainly on the right track , but as some members have already stressed , the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers ' responsibility will become a shared responsibility .    3.817503284275542
i would like to say that in italy , considerable headway has been made in this sector ; we are perhaps the first in europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end - of - life vehicles off the market , but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high , and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market .    3.9329600599542056
we need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter .    3.349922730432536
in italy , we have begun to withdraw and recycle around 80 % of old cars , but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis - in terms of unemployment given that in italy industry often UNK to lay - offs and redundancies - and cause problems for workers in different parts of italy .    3.8086660889774673
we must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements - parliament is sometimes a little extremist , adopting positions that are either extremely pro - green or extremely anti - green - and , all things considered , find a way to combine the effort made by mr florenz and that of other members , who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible .    3.387083304494252
these worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this ; i think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem , that is , to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements .    4.218027340715033
mr president , this directive deals with the UNK small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life .    3.8105912621870948
to that extent , it might be thought desirable , even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity .    4.2272991805427855
the key questions now are who pays the eur UNK per car for the 9 million cars that are disposed of each year ?    2.9497833693129047
who pays for the collection , the dismantling , the disposal and so on ?    4.044391694369723
and should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made ?    3.291768749465568
the proposal from the council , the common position , is that manufacturers should pay the lot .    4.769301072320713
that would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the european union .    3.312900782531642
that cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars .    3.1587726806669933
because european car manufactures have been operating here for many , many more decades than companies from japan , korea and elsewhere , that would be a much greater burden on the older european companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere .    3.1544470434932625
i also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from germany , italy , ireland , spain , sweden and britain , to remove the retrospective nature of this measure .    3.2993352264240943
retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is UNK law .    4.531105732708468
most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest , which clearly there is not in this case .    4.229693818459807
that is why i have called for a roll - call vote on this .    3.011797430590036
we can see who is prepared to vote for a UNK which is of doubtful legality , which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the european car industry .    4.272324979879152
mr president , once again i would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive , and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague , bernd lange .    3.802181184286138
these amendments actually have the advantage - and i should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives .    3.336148123017772
the council ' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all , or a significant part , of the costs of recovery and recycling .    4.084443915330251
but , as mr lange so rightly said , this solution is totally unfair to european car manufacturers .    3.8877616342441472
coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry , i can tell you that it is not possible , retroactively , to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road , i . e . effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80 % of the total number of cars in europe .    3.493885561397056
this solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs .    3.3898473004481957
the common position puts european car manufacturers in a UNK position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the european market .    4.7991380397866585
of course , we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby . we are here to build a europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive .    3.5384089587162255
this is why , i urge you to support the amendments tabled by bernd lange . these amendments will be supported by the group of the party of european socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting member states the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints , since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the members states , and some of them work perfectly well , will be able to continue to operate .    3.657362525583
mr president , commissioner , the proposed directive on end - of - life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the union , but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector .    3.278168417900153
let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must , of course , be exempt from the scope of this directive .    3.3033183285127747
cars are also part of our cultural heritage . i think we would all agree on that .    4.4993768990141785
having said that , one of the stumbling blocks concerns article 12 , i . e . the date on which the directive will come into force .    3.6973777842865205
parliament ' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive ' s entry into force , for new vehicles , is not terribly realistic .    3.900283495254973
the european car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be UNK even though they were not designed for recycling .    4.284731878311881
the common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road .    2.977055534196059
this would , furthermore , make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional UNK .    3.64513031643048
like my group , i shall therefore support this aspect the common position which , i feel , offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection .    3.969220949124165
mr president , the european parliament is today facing an important decision .    2.965911006764358
will we give our backing to forward - looking environmental and consumer protection or , as the amendments of florenz , lange and others cause me to fear , will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the german car industry ?    3.3516445454172836
the credibility of parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake .    3.481658347751667
it would be shameful to say the least if the european parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 member states and the european commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection !    4.302259399760626
the intention of florenz and lange in their amendments is obvious : to UNK the directive !    3.5593422100191967
the proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation .    2.7622743498938855
in setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more .    3.0723318257240484
this is totally unacceptable .    2.861802407139634
i therefore appeal to the german delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today !    3.1247151068244396
the red - green federal government has not exactly covered itself with UNK in the debate on the end - of - life vehicles directive .    3.581948462216303
do not continue in this UNK !    3.970441620151766
the UNK about competitive disadvantages is UNK if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the german car industry .    3.0837319824965372
start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers !    4.147428789835899
vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry !    4.253688601135584
mr president , this directive has been under discussion since 1997 .    2.922369572432297
it is high time that we reached an agreement .    2.6395622305799735
since i more or less share the views of my colleague , mr sjöstedt and the representative of the greens , mr de UNK , i am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me , and i will highlight just two issues .    4.501458919485433
firstly , and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal , the idea , which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste , that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution .    4.407497404033988
another point is that waste should not be UNK or crushed , not only in the case of lead , cadmium and mercury , but also in the case of waste which contains pvc .    4.163300082581024
parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context .    3.8337781813380785
the other question is who should bear the cost .    3.2017993732991097
i agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay , and this proposal expresses that idea very well .    3.9355552618998977
producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006 , as some of the amendments propose .    4.539390943976731
we are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading .    3.6058541877483976
it is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials .    2.7497545368940344
i believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines .    2.8525910967734953
lastly , mr president , i believe we should favour the creation of small and medium - sized businesses which , if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised , can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area , preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies .    3.448470019989647
mr president , today the european parliament must face up to real responsibilities .    3.5508677218827875
we have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year .    3.7149851563981375
in some of our member states , voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our UNK , UNK and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks , inhabited occasionally by an UNK UNK UNK .    4.116869249595135
i come , of course , from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in europe and in third countries .    4.072846847425823
i can gauge its importance for my country ' s international reputation .    3.401600647295832
i know of the proactive attitude of the european car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end - of - life vehicles .    3.3103290735832593
i am aware of the difficulties the council experienced in finding a compromise .    2.9032691036539866
that is why , today , we must be understanding UNK , concerned for our environment .    3.7637049449117828
this will either be the century of waste management or it will not .    3.6819699363650615
as far as i am concerned , at least , the principle of ' polluter pays ' must be applied .    2.983773010150774
the car industry , increasingly more UNK of the environment , has , i am sure , anticipated this kind of increasing awareness .    4.799688586515372
indeed it is accepting its responsibilities .    3.0310478486722507
it is the member states , however , who will have to implement this directive , and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions , the UNK and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in italy or in finland .    4.351241903894139
the men and women on the move throughout europe pay for their car and their UNK UNK , pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement .    3.499401098605013
it would certainly be unwise for my fellow members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the european parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer .    4.162155120120845
how , furthermore , can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within europe .    3.2722103386154635
who is to pay for recycling the car i bought in france if i register it in belgium ?    3.5224896325382082
which national fund will pay for my end - of - life vehicle ?    3.1115710785557757
let us beware , too , of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application .    3.573738247637033
it is not our intention to start a UNK legislative campaign here today , but to continue on our present course , advocating sustainable development .    3.3771146329218906
mr president , most of the time , the european parliament , UNK by environment committees , does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the european commission or the council , so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view .    4.848452672434834
now , a sound common position submitted by the council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in parliament .    3.5101780474605024
every year , we UNK a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances .    3.391985376521753
this is why it is important to prevent waste materials .    2.7564660196464814
we should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals , as well as of other dangerous substances and materials .    3.0881623145264805
in addition , car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re - use .    2.9287748246699365
what is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately .    2.4803601132534374
i therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re - use and recycling which have been proposed by the council .    2.893059082408587
these days , the complete dismantling of end - of - life vehicles is economically viable .    2.650934992218508
this means that we move away from shredding .    3.0752663767820776
the prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and , in the netherlands , a value of 86 % recycling has now already been achieved .    3.9092514951863513
the best way of achieving proper collection is to ensure that the last holder and / or owner can deliver the car to an authorised treatment facility without any cost .    2.935199369801803
the processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars .    3.5892122761634697
the proposals made by a few meps impact greatly on this system .    3.1483358440540283
the so - called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation .    3.1447057382602965
if the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied , it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably .    3.940751931663821
finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .    3.361750729324301
a laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay , at the expense of the environment .    3.4543824544095294
why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled ? if we are , then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the council on the result achieved .    4.582186627716474
mr president , i hold mr florenz in high UNK .    2.736122125383122
he has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry .    3.3004757471434365
add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and , against that background , find a compromise . that was not easy .    3.9372131655364777
overall , i am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position .    4.043381693801534
i would like to comment on two things . firstly , vintage cars and UNK .    2.9047274397401877
these should indeed be excluded from the directive . secondly , the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars .    4.342033732289886
i do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way .    3.796205818228832
the manufacturer is and should be liable and the last holder and / or owner must be able to hand back the car without any cost .    3.3921609342309935
in my opinion , there is too much initial hesitation .    3.7703778480522705
the car lobby has led too many people up the garden path .    3.150639771503776
i would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on .    3.3276506526307674
these costs are not very high .    3.828477592023932
in the member state where i come from , you are talking about 150 UNK per car .    4.431487920410861
if you charge this from day one , you can process the old cars straight away .    3.0720302014570464
a very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards , which used to be a common feature in our member states , would then disappear .    3.987046303679737
i do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise .    3.483558892159984
i think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible .    2.8149447971790273
this is positive because , in that way , the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto european roads will actually be processed appropriately , and this will benefit us all .    3.7688327600961355
mr president , the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end - of - life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re - use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars .    2.6805184551925074
i therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers ' liability .    3.8147031734982444
if we do reduce it , we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste .    3.033568883577445
the common position , which was arrived at with great difficulty in the council , which the commission has endorsed and which was also maintained in parliament ' s committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , complies fully with the environmental requirements . i therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers ' liability .    3.3327784420942055
if these amendments are adopted , i think that we shall cause parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues .    3.6300587800479946
so far , we here in parliament have been positive UNK for environmental protection but now , if the amendments proposed by mr florenz and mr lange are adopted , we are to become a negative factor for the environment in europe .    4.248046788666988
what is more , if we reduce manufacturers ' liability on this issue , this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas , for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from UNK and other electronic equipment .    4.299504350314188
i would therefore recommend to members of parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers ' liability .    3.2839426397614
we shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result .    3.464685141147231
mr president , this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars , encourage recycling , and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled .    3.0313466574194425
now who should pay the costs ?    3.8568199619943493
the best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars .    3.2788117099955083
do not be UNK by the car manufacturers !    4.168740667330308
if you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments .    3.382475687613074
mr president , commissioner , this debate is not a technical debate , contrary to what we may think .    3.6132861037459025
it has become eminently political .    3.015197899269815
yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate .    3.393558211785961
today , if UNK members of parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers , we should be doing ourselves UNK .    3.70081526247956
in expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end - of - life vehicles , as amendment no 38 stipulates , even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer , parliament would , for the first time , not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of europe , it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies .    3.6894232786322356
it would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas .    3.2247462188226743
the free recovery system , for example , for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly .    3.5449677872201057
thus , for the consumer , for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling , the council ' s common position definitely must not be amended . it is , as it stands , perfectly acceptable .    5.601859943386725
mr president , like so many others here today , i believe this is a good measure .    3.7891738243149957
this is a useful measure and it is one which we all need .    4.33414066176259
most of the technical issues have been resolved .    2.4154515887551526
there are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved .    2.832170261934699
we have arrived at the final question .    3.217273262589288
in the first reading debate it was only the economic and monetary affairs committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in parliament . that is quite simply : who pays ?    4.362908477125187
the council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost , not all of it as mr bowis has UNK said .    4.213679395333576
in fact perhaps as little , the lawyers tell us , as 20 % or one - fifth of the cost . that is not unreasonable .    4.016713411248995
they have paid already .    3.2306734910055717
why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers , pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from ?    3.122625358271349
i cannot accept that .    2.7521233456747165
there are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .    3.3057581159764906
i cannot accept it and i will not vote for it .    3.9067228650582297
the responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer .    3.7212212422235225
it is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal .    4.050430807493215
the common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government .    3.6699841091576193
the common position is a reasonable compromise .    3.187436036713368
some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road .    3.415399437064167
i cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of europe i am voting against those amendments .    3.3201145666761724
mr president , there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in europe will properly deal with end - of - life cars , although in this instance the council has not provided a model for a suitable european environment policy .    3.667063309490471
it is disgraceful the way in which the german presidency handled this matter .    3.450762865569597
firstly , herr UNK , the environment minister , was not in tune with his colleagues in the cabinet , then chancellor UNK UNK in like a UNK in a china shop , having no expert knowledge of this process .    3.886362083296633
mind you , even the resolution of the finnish council presidency in june was not the best result that could have been done achieved .    4.323433079730021
there are certain weaknesses , the greatest of which , in my opinion , is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses ; after all , the car industry is more than just large companies .    4.637989586386107
it is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium - sized enterprises .    3.746877846771147
for there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector .    3.4405409287861146
the plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and also the amendments in question from our group to article 5 concerning costs .    3.0928035160957683
the common position is also no great UNK from an environmental viewpoint .    3.292494716565448
it fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow UNK from the greens says that this is the first time that the european parliament has toned down a common position , i really must object , because quite simply , it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern , low - consumption cars such as the 3 - litre car , which contain a great deal of plastic , by means of rigid , high recycling quotas !    4.232414874510341
consequently , we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars .    3.7040781837353514
the objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .    4.61746394655597
however , the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing co2 levels in europe in other sectors besides these .    3.7507024580390795
mr president , we are indeed now in a very rare situation : those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the council in their common position .    4.149580839430574
if we UNK away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs , we will be creating a loophole : we will not have created a rational , clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order .    4.466938522850085
that is why , in my opinion , the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility .    3.2813118540684174
only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem , taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future .    3.156869690241769
mr president , there are two issues of principle in the council ' s draft directive .    3.2000878095713166
the first concerns the manufacturer ' s unrestricted liability to take back end - of - life vehicles .    2.3121115197312774
there is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade .    3.9216685430918257
this particularly applies in areas within the eu where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles .    3.938909792360927
i believe that , quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned , the eu ' s directives should not treat small companies within the union unfairly .    4.142927129769869
unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears , for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts .    4.181489418234158
yet the trade in used car parts is important , especially for those who collect and UNK older vehicles .    3.810978176272049
it should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up .    3.8856617889064013
they should be able to establish themselves in new markets , but also to leave old markets .    3.881258157746983
to bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development .    3.3381726064726847
the second principle in the council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive .    3.318551245905767
it conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product .    3.1382122077755454
to do so also changes the owner ' s liability retroactively .    4.195856053408938
over the years , a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways .    3.670833028449985
every country within the eu now has rules governing the scrapping of cars .    3.60294477229253
some may be better than others , and some worse .    3.26470828024461
in anticipation of this eu directive ' s being implemented , eu countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the eu legislation is not applied .    3.801214599421748
this does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds .    3.0627273884316977
mr president , everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question .    3.2603876893666763
the common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement , and puts the whole directive at risk .    2.89177258902018
i therefore maintain that parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument .    4.412162333045722
i would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive ; the costs are not excessive : recycling a car costs less than 1 % of the price of a new car .    3.323213290748727
moreover , the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006 , when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market .    3.9349926305066694
as for the remaining vehicles , we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs , as is proposed in amendments nos 44 and 45 by mr lange , the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries , and we should therefore support them .    4.118226415894555
mr president , this is an extremely bad directive .    2.9664603523666093
first of all , as my colleague mr bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle .    4.1007389029082
secondly , it UNK huge costs on the european motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment .    3.5902566051034155
in this parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment .    4.339487527541307
i suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect , which has not been examined well enough in this debate . it is like so much european legislation .    4.420622639472501
it is far too prescriptive .    3.1418106927670606
it sets in stone one particular model of recycling .    2.971541901173838
the production line was invented about a hundred years ago , i believe , by UNK ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles , to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them .    3.8849140860691764
one thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic UNK of cars .    3.6738753450990957
the plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so .    3.7602634812583755
this is a very environmentally reasonable approach .    2.914064471073802
it is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery .    2.7243248768919335
this method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the " dead " car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and UNK process .    3.1370272526258605
mr president , the common position is sound , but it is up to parliament to improve the common position on end - of - life vehicles .    3.6699455606447198
the social - democratic group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days .    2.9190779370434625
i would especially draw your attention to amendment no 45 , in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of UNK and recycling at the door of the manufacturer , for new cars at any rate .    4.38771839314005
for the cars currently on the road , it would be reasonable to share the cost , for example by setting up a fund such as that in the netherlands .    4.275220879174794
the common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end - of - life vehicles .    3.0217748388502397
this is a big problem in my opinion .    3.8174965529874223
i urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles , as they would gain an excessive hold over the second - hand components market .    3.587529421304815
they would then determine their own prices .    3.43433931497343
anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur UNK .    4.321827403975549
the european consumer organisation , which has asked us to support the common position on this point , is to my mind letting the consumer down .    4.950459620339159
a second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers ' UNK is the cost of transport .    3.9277196755408896
if car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies , this will UNK transporting end - of - life vehicles over long distances .    3.0368497735095237
this is environmentally UNK but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either .    3.2249037347618175
i would therefore appreciate your support for amendment no 45 .    2.8416292610103238
mr president , commissioner , i have asked to speak again so that i can say a few more words at the close of this debate .    3.1400318913376033
if you travel to the netherlands , you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost - free .    3.4966966948803897
you will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of , that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials , that 85 % of the weight of a car is recycled and that 92 % of all cars in the netherlands are recycled .    3.6821433258064453
this is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes .    3.531381421977785
should this be condemned ecologically , UNK UNK ?    4.335247289369121
i do not think so .    2.233127632409612
the netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or , in the case of end - of - life vehicles currently driving around , the manufacturer , has nothing , absolutely nothing , to do with UNK ; it is a simple question of competition !    3.9171587106277923
the issue here is whether a european manufacturer should pay eur 250 million or a UNK manufacturer , say , eur 2 million .    3.3712843777450607
in terms of the people who build cars here in europe , i am in favour of not making competition unequal but , in terms of environmental protection , i want freedom from costs for the last owner , to be financed by a special fund , and manufacturer responsibility for new cars , which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars !    4.313429310465879
( applause from the pse group )    2.2339401374085748
mr president , the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages , mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re - use , the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials , etc . i think we have tabled a sound proposal .    3.8829835980080625
the main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer , the vendor , or whoever , should take the end - of - life vehicle back without any cost .    3.168040624426995
we have reached an agreement with all the parties involved .    3.6967844088665966
these include car manufacturers , second - hand car dealers , the federation of the car industry , the UNK processing firms , shredding firms and the government .    3.446508015384308
the car industry - and belgium produces a great many cars - did not have any problem with that .    3.6894538027647146
UNK can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost .    3.3884239350193965
in connection with this , we have noticed how - quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment - a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well .    3.9445693727884965
some businesses have become hi - tech businesses , because they managed to recycle certain materials , even materials which are not yet included in the directive .    3.751100983811458
so this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain .    3.372910409166985
i am in favour of collection free of charge .    2.727140871623659
it worked for us .    3.6160269881805434
why would it not work elsewhere ?    3.4108084832777195
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented .    2.989592848337842
would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .    2.743485470145285
allow me briefly to comment on some of the UNK and principles behind the present directive .    4.158843350677134
allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate .    3.4717158287208125
what we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the european union , resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste .    3.4888942396715414
this means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars , and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open .    3.2449573420039575
moreover , they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind .    3.1926655639231947
approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars , but also cadmium , chromium , mercury and other very dangerous substances .    4.023238018055575
this is something you already know , but i would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening .    4.053302185439245
cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in europe .    3.796258538033609
we know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .    4.066655306304544
the present directive has three aims . first of all , we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars .    3.4278423339860384
secondly , we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable .    4.67055050398053
we can no longer take care of these matters at the end of a product ' s life - cycle . instead , we should avoid creating so much waste .    3.517451617029995
we should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product .    3.4532773578569973
thirdly , we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive .    3.9591380951459683
these are the three most important aims of the directive .    3.2766548637651636
this is , of course , because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled .    3.8839448912143797
it is , above all , the manufacturer ' s resources we are wasting if we do not get to grips with a car ' s life - cycle .    3.0970748918408257
first of all : who should pay ?    3.3312315931707994
and secondly : are we reducing the european car industry ' s competitiveness by means of the present proposal ?    3.878187537785638
the first question , then , is about who should pay .    3.6467611634981916
the directive states that the polluter should pay and that the cost is to be borne mainly by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles to be found in the eu ' s treaty concerning the manufacturer ' s liability .    3.8998223496284505
it is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers .    3.5325792345363913
we have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car .    3.3133334609668887
do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ?    5.108444733886579
no . clearly , we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment , but it will be very much greater .    4.967271946971016
moreover , the cost will have to be borne in the future .    4.1071935778403175
the cost will not therefore disappear , but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed .    3.6565366731860456
are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis ?    3.5514951884848807
is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it ?    3.6778524543598676
is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these ?    2.932814911281022
is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the european car industry ?    3.305736367033379
no , of course not .    4.50769418204246
it is quite the opposite .    2.887791406592703
do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel - efficient cars is going to decline in the future ?    3.250157898418822
what kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars ?    3.556609510664408
naturally , that they should be environmentally friendly , that they should be recyclable , that they should be fuel - efficient and that they should not pollute our environment .    3.702355694772885
it is , of course , only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry .    3.5145156872680126
we must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste , recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel - efficient cars .    3.9064635746182392
the fact that we have a european car industry which has already made great UNK more than properly UNK for the fact that there are , in fact , a good many cars on european roads for which they must take responsibility .    4.192368751834201
if we develop motive power of the kind i have described , i am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload .    3.830380969387934
these will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems .    2.8012079335654985
the industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in europe .    3.562288662842282
they will not represent an insurmountable cost for the european car industry .    3.2894179754212325
they will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel - efficient cars .    2.8263313122066203
we must do this for the sake of the environment .    3.297640853743228
the costs will not disappear . nor will the waste disappear .    3.285124583051026
but , otherwise , we must all of us , as taxpayers or citizens , foot the bill . what is more , the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action .    3.4860373111695493
that is what i should like to say by way of introduction .    3.900100463473007
i also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation .    3.9819804188501657
if we assume that , on average , a car has a life of eleven years , do members , indeed does anyone , believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem ?    3.4857940830287046
do you think that , when we legislate about chemicals , we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future ?    4.94775253360598
clearly , we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars .    4.008050443976153
we can deal with it .    3.1389196544151265
we already have an infrastructure .    3.129289385714613
we have what we require in order to deal with end - of - life cars .    3.3162860341018527
if i have not already done so , i would also thank mr karl - heinz florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .    3.0793281670690424
in fact , it is in many respects pioneering work when it comes to re - use and manufacturer ' s liability .    3.34469140763809
i believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment .    3.4227647420116187
as i have said , we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues .    3.707523083386461
after the first reading in the european parliament in 1999 , the commission ' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the council .    4.5274607392936295
however , we obtained a well - balanced common position in july during the finnish presidency .    2.9958541979133417
now , we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully .    4.285303162815248
a total of 48 amendments have been tabled .    3.765904620709326
the commission can adopt 10 amendments in their entirety .    2.8982099075753167
three amendments can be partially approved , and one can be approved in principle .    3.518655551755073
certain amendments concern improvements to the commission ' s proposal which we adopted as early as at the first reading or else they reintroduce into the directive such parts of the original proposal as the council has removed .    4.0745205005942084
this applies to amendment no 5 , excluding section 1 ; 8 and 9 , section 1 ; 10 and 12 , section 3 ; 15 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 24 and 25 .    2.753748930238553
these amendments can all be approved .    3.217482630143764
the commission can also approve amendment no 26 with certain UNK changes .    2.8752157820362987
they cannot therefore be approved .    3.205648493887932
parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in europe .    3.0420289150681237
it would UNK and UNK me if it were not to do so today .    4.978956942387469
i am very concerned about certain amendments from parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question .    3.1472234911583614
these concern , for example , the phasing - out of heavy metals , manufacturer ' s liability and the requirement for recycling .    3.057143840854518
i want to deal with these amendments on a group - by - group basis .    3.7836602603983454
amendments nos 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 concern the phasing - out of heavy metals .    2.338492386960905
amendment no 12 involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force .    3.194382993814825
amendments nos 13 , 28 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions .    2.4681056826612906
this would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly .    3.416260386528811
amendments nos 4 , 11 and 30 mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling .    3.1324742955363156
the commission considers that the type of phasing - out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view .    3.1324985706073383
amendments nos 17 , 18 , 27 , 34 , 36 , 38 , 44 and 45 relate to the manufacturer ' s liability .    2.712658274006918
the compromise reached by the council is fair but fragile .    4.491301052199728
the commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without , at the same time , creating tensions .    3.503726695543965
i regret the confusion which arose recently due to internal documents from the commission being wrongly used , so creating uncertainty about the commission ' s attitude to the issue .    3.8039399445648328
i want to emphasise that , as early as 1997 , the commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer ' s liability and that the commission entirely supports the common position .    4.130779403353769
this does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers . far from it .    2.813397505111346
amendments nos 39 , 40 , 46 and 47 concern quantified objectives .    2.7638438278077953
the high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed .    4.3250656123333995
these amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise .    3.7408346672073063
allow me also - listen carefully to what i am saying now , because i have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and " UNK " cars as mentioned in amendments nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and 35 .    3.7954048843020045
so , whatever has been stated in this regard , vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive .    3.2646840260109067
we do not consider that amendments nos 2 and 14 add anything to the directive .    3.210445518470472
amendment no 23 involves the commission ' s having to adopt quality standards for UNK components .    3.501665851944971
this is not covered by the directive .    3.4187983280873593
an ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the european parliament and the council .    3.8290842479170752
amendments nos 29 , 31 and 41 water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles .    3.044275360977014
there is a danger of amendments nos 31 and 41 reducing the chances of recycling plastic , tyres and glass .    2.856426848971422
finally , the commission cannot approve amendments nos 1 and 33 for reasons to do with legal clarity ; nor amendment no 19 , which the commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage .    3.810892551848892
furthermore , amendment no 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability .    3.2833400818771157
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.894443415166077
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
we shall now proceed to the vote .    1.8722281289198166
vote    3.0905809937555753
madam president , as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors , particularly in the french version .    3.4159522889794176
you have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which i have had dealings recently .    4.369659980759097
there is an error which has still not been UNK and that is on amendment no 4 .    4.008621092596768
in the english version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations .    2.9708151974201127
in the french version that becomes ' entreprises UNK et organisations UNK ' .    2.8946015044615345
could you please make sure that french - speaking members of this house know that the word entreprises is not correct .    3.582761534306156
it should not be in the amendment .    3.7763723405694267
and , again , i urge you , madam president , to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently .    4.608419057751946
madame mcnally , in general , i am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations .    3.7992332732875465
i shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution .    3.20886015684961

we consider the english version to be the original text .    3.846600060385052
to give you an example , in both paragraphs 4 and 5 of the dutch and german versions , the equivalents of the english words : " in so far as " have been omitted .    3.4559296826171098
this is why i would ask you to consider the english version as the original version .    3.2214682004685824
thank you , mr van velzen .    3.261772742407223
in response i shall say the same thing i said to mrs mcnally just now .    3.661182566961266
i am very concerned about these translation problems which , unfortunately , we seem to be having increasingly , and i can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed .    3.7335082346994932
in any case , the authoritative version is always , of course , the original language version .    3.280520003499998

explanations of vote    3.1542153314927477
- ( fr ) i am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the commission entitled ' women and science ' .    3.2651883145732024
in this document , the commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in europe .    3.5496281633013766
this objective deserves our total support .    3.142126307187343
expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the european union , after agriculture and the structural funds .    4.05934913542613
the various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between UNK in various member states .    3.1859951752954903
relatively few women , however , are active in scientific UNK despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies .    3.7238826045031153
it is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented .    3.6650428657549177
i am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the european commission .    3.4730623255549222
the commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at community level , especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , which is quite obviously something i approve of .    3.5408444913085697
the goal for the years to come is to increase women ' s participation to achieve a rate of 40 % female participation in the marie UNK grants , in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .    3.1238671959303344
in order to do so , it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various member states , to set up a coordinating body to implement a ' women and science ' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women ' s participation in research activities .    3.14487656906546
furthermore , like the rapporteur , i think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields .    4.2071596543350855
improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles .    3.931080687394263
we will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy .    3.2289562932425033
the european parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .    3.2932586285937435
we must incorporate the gender factor in science , research and all other european union policies , in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market .    3.392727600557294
in its communication " women and science " , the european commission informs us of its good intentions of UNK the support of women to enrich research in europe .    4.145721276513955
this is very good , and we are pleased to see it .    4.771867622139606
we know that we can change this situation , in which women are underrepresented in the science sector , only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and , when they have obtained their degrees , by means of positive measures at the professional level .    3.738807809079068
having said this , some of our fellow members clearly have UNK because the report by the committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40 % female participating in research in europe .    3.418800370623932
this is patently not the case , since such a quota would not be realistic .    3.8795508590313905
indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved .    3.134338950595595
to set my fellow members ' minds at ease and to reassure them , i have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the commission , in its communication , undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women ' s participation in community research programmes , which is , after all , a praiseworthy goal .    3.9204306011765877
and why should we not note that the commission ' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40 % minimum level to be a crucial goal for women ' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes ?    4.5699004268447485
it is not a quota !    3.221122744253489
it is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the commission , insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of member states .    3.6248736894729547
the latter would be well advised , however , to follow the good example of the commission , for once , and make the same efforts in their own research programmes .    4.424153284165132
people must realise this !    3.386013596626161
i am pleased to see that the debate on mrs mcnally ' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women ' s participation in professions in research and science , met with a fairly wide consensus .    3.275235276687176
on this subject , any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable , and i can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women : to enjoy equal access to scientific study , to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence , and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly , enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career .    3.83702029136662
this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy , however , which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must , as far as we are concerned , necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity , which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject .    4.101768657799192
by having the opportunity to show their true merit , by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women , and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege , women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish . in this way they will succeed in UNK balances which are still not in their favour .    3.7933026496951903
since the european parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms , and in spite of the general approach which i approve for the most part , i can do no other than abstain from the vote on mrs mcnally ' s report .    3.947605935877801
second reading of the florenz report ( a5 - 0006 / 2000 )    3.010430625972036
madam president , today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the directive on end - of - life vehicles .    3.4645487892680444
i have rejected the entire directive , not least because amendment no 34 to article 12 and the amendments to article 5 / 4 have not received an adequate majority here in the house .    3.499625043613862
i come from a country which manufactures 50 % of the cars in the eu and it is precisely the free collection of end - of - life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable .    3.7827838303413213
here , in my opinion , the labour market is also considerably UNK by the costs arising to these companies .    3.7169056990799945
i consider that this is a serious UNK and that , in principle , it does not UNK our legal system .    4.761486045945523
in my opinion , this directive is unacceptable for this reason .    3.6356108883477263
madam president , i would like to comment on the florenz report .    2.4841610249988952
i think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the council has been toned down , the major groups here ( and above all the german delegates of the major groups ) have not , thank god , succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive , namely manufacturer responsibility .    4.269399228920191
unfortunately , there has been a UNK down of the effective ecological material flow policy , i . e . through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years .    3.0071412461644362
we know that lead , mercury , cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made .    2.7743729274302695
here , unfortunately , the european parliament has UNK to the interests of industry .    5.054972045962984
i am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of florenz , lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end - of - life vehicles .    2.6836246513040725
i found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and i am pleased that it failed , that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large member state did not gain a majority , by which i mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the european parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries .    4.03401548134644
madam president , although i too have spent most of my life in fast cars , i agree with my colleague , mr florenz , that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included .    4.110025484835776
these splendid cars do not constitute waste .    3.1492863022832003
that is why i voted in favour of the amendments .    2.672925214861595
neither can we UNK what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country ' s statutes to another ' s .    3.506691874370508
in this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .    2.838093350975699
we cannot forget old car enthusiasts either , of whom there are more than 50 000 in finland alone .    3.1219187788631846
they are involved in low - profile work of valuable cultural importance .    3.1525801195211165
- ( sv ) the parliamentary process concerning this question has been confusing , to say the least .    2.8177976103653632
before the vote at the plenary sitting , new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the committee .    3.692054444384044
we need a directive in this area , and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure .    3.6309871000753793
the directive concerning end - of - life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation .    3.188910945896198
it is therefore important that the manufacturer ' s liability should be clear . this should not in any way be jeopardised .    3.535137773677328
today , parliament is examining , for the last time , this text on ' end - of - life ' vehicles and what is to be done with them : their destruction , a commendable intention with regard to our environment .    4.275889481451247
there are , however , two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text .    3.769133901068193
first of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?    3.7375093371217263
we must all ensure that it is not always the same person , i . e . the vehicle owner , who pays .    3.5807518372410367
he or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle , which is a UNK UNK in financial terms .    4.187320260761627
another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope .    3.698499507341545
one might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point , but i feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts .    4.838463970899373
so let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these UNK of the UNK industry .    4.644488328032776
these old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by europe , if we are not to water down each of our specific identities .    3.859851477466733
i only need to mention the case of directives 79 / UNK and 92 / 43 .    3.6855386693633108
the precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis .    3.650927477081021
it is not the job of the mep to generate UNK or legal proceedings for judges in any arena . that would not be fulfilling our mission .    3.1639617379970955
on the contrary , we must adopt crystal - clear texts in order to limit legal disputes .    3.439339228963222
.    2.4274255028413507
( nl ) that the florenz report has caused such a stir has been proven by the powerful lobby machine which has been set in motion by both industry and the environmental movement .    3.31636361522946
i regret that the manufacturers have UNK the european parliament and the council with a whole UNK of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false .    3.500321554962041
i dare say this because i took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from , among others , scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully .    3.2908486166447797
they made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety , for example , are UNK .    4.0880747708530505
the directive remains in place .    3.0688687433016995
i expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements .    4.036111920720721
- my party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments .    3.564853115182336
there are few things more certain in life than taxes , death and pollution .    2.834837637434318
however , there is also nothing more certain than eu environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives .    3.111208041426939
when it comes to pollution , like sin , we are all against it , but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good .    3.6617112235959173
in fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .    3.800455483979061
as is so often the case , it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem , which will only serve to create more jobs for officials , and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money .    3.529729063652151
the one thing it will not do is solve the problem - it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut .    3.7815498087355577
no one , not least my party , could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged , but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market , not to create another bureaucratic UNK .    4.993403298767829
thus , a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles , to encourage private sector recycling companies , through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements , and to incentivise the use of recycled materials .    3.6565920840996555
of course , these are areas where the eu does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction .    3.509092490302335
however , in the absence of these powers , it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure .    3.5988340391282394
instead , it should leave member states to develop their own systems , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good .    4.618209366350381
berger report ( a5 - 0007 / 2000 )    2.652103154048232
this proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third - country nationals , for the provision of cross - border services .    3.073604497690604
third - country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one member state do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the european union .    3.119060310098335
until now , the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the union of non - community workers have been very harsh .    4.0489293129157655
it is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the european union is being made easier , even when they are nationals of third countries .    3.726365719458053
nevertheless , the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another member state when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence . this means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the member state to which they were posted .    3.824053776449888
this means that this proposal ' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers , but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services .    4.074460369433412
on the other hand , for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the berger report , one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any member state .    3.804046833818344
berger report ( a5 - 0007 / 2000 ) and berger report ( a5 - 0012 / 2000 )    2.894166469847774
it is with the greatest satisfaction that i welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services .    3.022224911506438
basically , these proposals introduce the eu service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a european union member state to provide services in other member states , a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits .    3.9077077581074664
the first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a member state which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another member state on a temporary basis to provide services there .    3.392616556466492
according to the terms of the directive , the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned .    3.499293767997978
logically , in order to be given such a card , the employee must be legally resident in a member states and must be covered by a social security scheme .    4.648348566762221
the second proposal grants the same rights to self - employed workers who are third country nationals .    2.9008841908728105
while , basically , i subscribe to the european commission proposals , nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion .    4.099062340933728
that is why i am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur .    2.50004743031627
this will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any UNK !    3.468455334227191
other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures , for example by authorising member states to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards .    3.7342791682383862
i feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions .    3.9274060641512487
i can , therefore , only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended . we could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the european union had to face so many problems .    3.9131085264418264
this goes against the fundamental principle of non - discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this union .    3.2620547559867656
marinho report ( a5 - 0003 / 2000 ) :    4.037470065080269
we have serious reservations about the council ' s proposed amendments .    3.6602891258061008
how can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the court of first instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that court because it is UNK ?    3.9067557173932754
the first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter .    3.4945612237868997
some people will say that UNK is not a realistic aim , but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them :    4.497828287636553
on 1 january 1995 , the council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in article 17 of the accession treaty of 24 june 1994 .    3.890050105870575
in may 1995 , during the preparatory phase of the treaty of amsterdam , the cfi , concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases , was already insisting on the need to take measures ' without which the court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role . in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial . '    4.167895664866463
so what was done at amsterdam ?    3.2574978553537375
in that respect , nothing . on the contrary , extending the community ' s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden .    3.531190246370248
you will agree , furthermore , that the texts adopted by this house always call for community jurisdiction , and that includes for the charter of fundamental rights which is currently being drawn up .    3.995531517860411
the increase in the number of cfi judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere UNK , grudgingly granted , which we have become aware of after the fact .    3.384533407868155
consequently , these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake . they represent a downward UNK which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred .    3.6706379162760827
we cannot agree to this , since such a UNK shift towards a europe of the judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our states .    3.5495253195521665
the time has come , we feel , for in - depth consideration of how to put the community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice .    3.979330905962227
this question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity .    3.0159574957161666
is the forthcoming intergovernmental conference not the ideal opportunity for this ?    3.54534386010042
dimitrakopoulos and leinen report ( a5 - 0018 / 2000 )    3.0878192951191425
- ( sv ) the most important task of the approaching intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states .    2.735537995050814
we therefore , of course , support the european parliament ' s now giving the formal go - ahead to the intergovernmental conference .    2.4376119091566846
we nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place .    3.1889281290526337
we also argued this in november 1999 , and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 november 1999 .    3.7401227141449205
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) in the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , the european parliament calls for a " constitutional process to be launched " .    3.8499994285169494
this determination to UNK nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so - called charter of fundamental rights , which is really a UNK constitution .    3.85876875722221
it is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the european parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in austria .    3.6870269267414106
the same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the commission for the intergovernmental conference .    3.8874675779855736
the key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority , of states and peoples , in order to increase the commission ' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority states .    3.8889259373199914
incidentally , the french will probably be interested to learn that the commission is asking for article 67 of the amsterdam treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the european parliament .    3.9509893295966814
people will remember that this article , dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the community level , stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the council and thereafter the council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system .    4.3632179210489905
in france , both in the national assembly and in the senate , when this was being ratified , many members of the french parliament were reassured to hear that , in any case , the council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision - making .    4.2680304806309675
well , today , the same minister of european affairs who drew up the treaty of amsterdam , who has , in the meantime , become a european commissioner , mr barnier , proposes to decide , at the forthcoming igc , that the council will operate in these areas by majority decision .    4.598712618104559
this is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of european integration with the brussels institutions .    3.2189366044395733
the french must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making , but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent .    3.8173524379072656
if they yield , they are lost .    3.8541716787312392
for it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one .    3.585938771028347
. ( da ) the danish social democrats have today voted against the report on the convening of the intergovernmental conference .    2.539756393154891
it is crucial for us that it should be possible for this intergovernmental conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities , such as the weighting of votes in the council of ministers and the composition of the commission and the european parliament , which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the eu .    3.855393168938876
we were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the helsinki summit in december .    3.785123711566074
an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process .    3.3044219119789497
that is something we do not want to see , and we have therefore voted against any such extension .    3.849810602484005
we nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the intergovernmental conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding .    3.8494786192537886
.    2.4274255028413507
( sv ) we are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the intergovernmental conference at the helsinki conference .    3.8599035667181942
possible future member states ought to be involved in , and have an influence upon , the shaping of the eu of the future .    4.430533103055009
the elections to the european parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist eu centred upon brussels .    3.6514430829959528
with the convening of the forthcoming igc , the process of european union is topical once again .    3.997312858263646
once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the heads of state and government .    3.183207925822751
in other words , fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide , behind closed doors , on the fate of more than 350 million individuals .    3.7643456937513533
it is therefore easy to understand the public ' s lack of interest , given the construction of europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them .    4.165740007584028
in fact , one only need look at the agenda of the igc : the institutions , enlargement and european defence .    3.783781735438818
the fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power , the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of eastern europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of europe , particularly by increasing military budgets .    3.8077493488182523
social europe , used as a UNK by the eu , has simply been eliminated from the agenda .    4.279646745565833
all this does is to UNK the development , on the european scale , of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers ' main claims towards the highest common denominator .    3.504792091391425
this is why i am voting against the report .    2.339765850098315
i voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the igc . i did so because it sums up the philosophy of the portuguese presidency , which is supported by a broad majority in parliament , of opening up the igc agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between member states , large and small , as was originally stated when the helsinki council was UNK .    4.016604417047278
unfortunately , in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for UNK to the treaty on european union , nothing has so far been stated about the need to review article 7 , which deals with suspending a state in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the " founding " principles of the union , as laid down in article 6 .    4.079180724585608
nevertheless , the legal mechanisms that exist in the treaty are weak , difficult to apply politically and legally , do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance . suspending a state is just such a process , and is to be condemned .    4.055762894142577
i therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the igc agenda , and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the treaties .    3.778130161410647
we feel that these issues result from the igc ' s appropriateness and its objectives , as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there .    3.5556205172211754
we have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the igc because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged .    3.3620528608899454
this relates in particular to the intended agenda , particularly as regards the amsterdam leftovers , which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future . this also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars , which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the european union .    3.6934317999789568
these are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us .    4.298473211158758
- the european parliamentary labour party has abstained on the final vote on the leinen dimitrakopoulos report .    3.7384065136817024
the text is overambitious , and britain ' s labour meps believe that the igc should primarily deal with the " amsterdam left - overs " in order to prepare for enlargement , and not expand far beyond these .    4.000696343981284
there is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the eu institutions .    4.306378617047395
expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de - stabilisation .    3.772999094124699
the key factor in this text as it has been amended , is the call for a charter of fundamental rights to be incorporated into the treaties .    4.061804302376589
in our view , this would bring with it a complex legislative burden , and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are .    3.8317221546757603
our priorities ( i . e . the " left - overs " ) must be :    3.2375880126530587
the number and responsibilities of commissioners    3.9588137342478387
weighting of votes in the council    4.642383303981902
extension of qmv in areas where it will benefit the uk and europe ( but not treaty change , defence matters , border controls or taxation ) , and extension of codecision wherever qmv is extended    3.339643070442243
beyond this , we have concerns that the " flexibility " or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .    3.6402548425648895
the provisions of amsterdam are largely UNK and allowing more scope for opt - outs could weaken the eu at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other european legislation .    3.6296668828602177
- ( sv ) in order to be able to influence developments , the european parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the intergovernmental conference than emerges from the present resolution , which displays far too much disappointment and UNK about the decision which the european council made in helsinki in december 1999 .    4.247693709629802
the european parliament and its committee on constitutional affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the council decision in helsinki , so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion , including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the european union and their financial interests .    4.535614994561762
we swedish christian democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the eu to the east if the agenda for the intergovernmental conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the intergovernmental conference in amsterdam in 1997 .    3.5862737502078312
the most important task of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states .    2.6900897155138304
i therefore , of course , support the european parliament ' s now giving the formal go - ahead to the intergovernmental conference .    2.441416870407603
i nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place .    3.204912731840439
joint resolution on austria    4.83034191890564
madam president , the union for a europe of nations group did not associate itself with the joint ppe / de - pse resolution on the political situation in austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and jörg haider ' s freedom party .    2.8679972295941103
this ppe / de - pse resolution UNK the initiative taken by fourteen member states to apply pressure to austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott .    3.3369086238820485
what we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the treaty , as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact , in this instance , have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples .    3.595885086753174
whatever jörg haider ' s UNK excesses , which we of course deplore , the austrians have made a democratic choice , and we must respect this .    4.603311832814891
in our opinion , it is clear that the left wing in the european parliament , in association with the austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena , have UNK a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately UNK period .    3.434614332264859
although UNK haider to hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever , it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in UNK some ppe / de members of parliament .    3.326242585671749
but , going beyond this petty political operation , what the majority in the european parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left - right UNK in austria , which caused political life to stagnate and UNK , may soon spread to the european system of co - management which is producing equally appalling results .    4.1980935632566965
in order to prevent this threat to the system , it is ready to do anything , including UNK the outcome of free elections , including setting up a thought police , including establishing a new form of totalitarianism .    4.1486784037218145
is this UNK spontaneous ?    3.246418772720024
is it the product of mere foolishness or , more probably , of a deliberate strategy , which is the same throughout the world ?    4.082524470566014
underground networks ?    4.100747652300162
the government of the united states , or of israel ?    4.1830289142916035
or their socialist back - up troops who , in this house , have the UNK to thrust their values down our UNK ?    4.098860591150521
what , then , are the values of these socialists who UNK their electoral UNK in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in UNK UNK for the benefit of the UNK , and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants , full - time union officials and state UNK ?    4.432950803358057
what are the values of the belgian socialist party , which only goes from UNK scandals to corruption scandals , via UNK and UNK ?    3.3484357367175357
what are the values of the french socialist party , which UNK money from all the town councils under its UNK in the UNK , UNK and UNK scandals ?    4.208615336357065
the party led by UNK UNK , UNK with the UNK of UNK UNK ' s UNK government , the party whose leading lights have just been caught red - handed once again , living a life of luxury on the public funds UNK from the students ' mutual insurance company .    4.0644874241489415
i shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the italian socialist party , because it does not do to UNK a man when he is down , still less when he is dead and gone .    3.8600083862896137
i shall , however , mention the spanish socialist party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of UNK and which settled its accounts with basque nationalists by UNK contract UNK .    3.624440290106469
i shall also mention the german socialist party which UNK to preach to us about the second world war , when it is international socialist in the way that its UNK were national socialists , still goose - stepping , the party of the waffen ss .    3.440843646556127
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
madam president , i had a major problem with this resolution .    3.3259129018693105
finally , i abstained on the vote for a number of reasons .    3.5516598818436944
i was in sympathy with the edd group amendment , talking about rejecting the interference of the eu in the formation of governments of members states but i had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc . and i felt that it might be misinterpreted .    3.5637619182951297
however , i do wonder about the wisdom of this .    2.8947046512790626
firstly , there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long - term consequences of that .    3.3868029152862245
i also wonder about the wisdom of the eu and its reaction to the formation of the government in austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there .    3.4730855046027105
at the moment it seems that the haider party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments .    3.0722158686585477
even america has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations .    4.009334851728631
i really think that people should be extremely cautious .    3.316179290896869
if you want to combat xenophobia and racism , and i believe that we should , we need to look at the root causes .    4.131405155376065
we need to look at the people who vote for these parties , and understand why this situation arises .    3.5957468061754936
it is not a situation that most people in this parliament want , but we need to be careful about the approach we take , so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve .    4.658995638048437
madam president , i strongly refute any statement , demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism .    2.6342960676295806
i passionately defend europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law .    3.371413491466478
i disagree , however , for this very reason , with the UNK actions taken by the presidency - the portuguese presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional UNK on behalf of the other fourteen states .    5.331718118607364
this is not the way to fight extremism .    3.107911026954341
it may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good .    3.80297432200692
the UNK of confusion and UNK actions that has been unleashed over austria has UNK things out of all proportion . it has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and UNK risks that had previously not even been considered .    3.457507201426648
there is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law , but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the austrians and UNK roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law , in this case the standards laid down in the treaties .    3.6300375408008216
what are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an intergovernmental conference ?    2.98460249524338
a europe of 27 states or a europe of 14 , or even fewer ?    4.391356653572946
we support europe , a europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point , a europe which respects the treaties and the law and a europe which needs austria .    4.125641672960321
this needs to be said !    4.1641394669811165
madam president , i am delighted and proud that this parliament has , by an enormous majority , condemned the formation of the coalition in austria incorporating mr haider ' s freedom party .    3.2207929357949374
mr haider has demonstrated , over the past years by both words and deeds , that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse .    3.3350236261645834
not only has he admired adolf hitler , praised the waffen ss , and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four roma , but also in carinthia has been a member of the regional government .    3.2736304593893326
he has led efforts to end provision for austria ' s slovene - speaking minority and assistance to immigrants .    3.029978973546817
some have said it is not right for us to interfere in austrian politics .    4.1540212785576065
they are wrong .    3.291488653535707
european union treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights .    3.050981134391738
some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .    4.714240391386276
however , democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy .    3.568177589052695
there is the tragic UNK of the holocaust , the death of 6 million jews , to those who argued the same case with respect to germany in the 1930s .    3.68176713490705
however , we should not condemn mr haider for ambition .    3.2244364115182362
UNK do not change their spots .    3.751698077721924
the real UNK are austria ' s christian democrat acting as UNK goats to UNK a threat to europe that we thought had died berlin in UNK .    3.604002070678766
madam president , we have just passed a resolution which condemns the racist and xenophobic record of jörg haider ' s freedom party in austria , which has welcomed action by our governments to cut off political relations with any government of which he is part , and which sends our support to anti - racist groups within the democratic majority of the austrian people .    3.8057010929007853
we warn that this coalition , if it is formed today , unacceptably UNK the extreme right , directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation , which bring us together in this european union .    3.703185367804269
these are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us .    3.295899566886806
this european parliament requires the european commission to be vigilant of any racist action in austria , and threatens to suspend austria from membership of the european union if this happens .    4.351079865858201
i am proud to support such a resolution .    3.1917322698652786
though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any austrian government representative to this european parliament has not carried today , i give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this european parliament to combat the return of neo - nazis to government in europe can and will be taken .    4.408960707806011
i shall take the floor very briefly , madam president .    3.5213427921018043
i respect parliament ' s wish , as it has been expressed , but i must also say that the self - determination of peoples cannot be called into question , even by the european parliament .    5.190656270422197
the document is unfair both to austrian members of the european parliament , and to members of the austrian national parliament , and it smacks slightly of UNK and political interests , but also of business .    5.195490655605472
i do not believe that these signals will change the citizens ' indifference to europe .    3.0513856067542786
the austrian extreme right has been UNK an unwarranted present .    3.5577633216042144
i very much welcome the position taken by the italian radicals ; and i say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between italian liberals and austrian liberals .    2.961655884316212
i have for many years , in word and deed , been committed to the anti - fascist struggle and the UNK for equal rights and against xenophobia . however , recent events - firstly , what were really threats by the council of ministers , then mr prodi ' s threats against the austrian commissioner and , finally , the present decision - are things i cannot support .    3.7624403330677243
i have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though i agree with many of its premises . what we have here , first and foremost , is an incredibly UNK mixture of power , arrogance and impotence on the part of the european union .    3.5063476266007116
not only do these decisions conflict with the treaty and apportion to the institutions of the union more power than that to which they are entitled but , worst of all , their effect will be counter - productive .    4.026613607760432
they will not weaken mr haider and the fpö . on the contrary , they will strengthen them .    3.769694483347345
we shall obtain the very opposite of what we want .    3.8580816400019584
that is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right .    3.188468911281286
. ( da ) the left ' s members of the european parliament attach importance to the fact that , with today ' s decision , parliament has not supported the fourteen prime ministers ' diplomatic sanctions against austria .    3.5039858703849016
the left ' s members of parliament therefore supported the liberal decision ' s powerful rejection of any form of xenophobia in austria or elsewhere .    3.2536622270982885
we attach crucial importance to applying , if necessary , the new provisions under article 7 of the amsterdam treaty so that a country which , by its actions , UNK fundamental citizens ' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the eu ' s council of ministers removed .    4.342390347370349
- ( el ) the freedom party ' s participation in the austrian government is a dangerous development for the european union ' s political future .    3.906671383895633
it is a ' trojan horse ' which is unfortunately UNK in europe larger than ever since the second world war .    3.136372459874397
the european parliament and the union ' s governments must politically isolate a government that includes UNK of nazism and advocates of xenophobia .    3.414600727530243
the european union bears a large measure of responsibility - and along with it the two dominant political movements , the social democrats and the christian democrats - because , by their UNK adherence to the harsh financial policies of emu , their UNK of the welfare state and their UNK of uncontrolled competition , they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right - wing extremists of the haider type to recruit support for their neo - nazi ways .    3.5362820145517277
   3.7318943719743674
in view of the fact that the rules of procedure of the european parliament do not permit us to table our own resolution condemning haider ' s party , as well as all the parties throughout europe which disseminate racist slander and which are xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers , we voted in favour of the compromise resolution . we did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms , in order to show our solidarity with all those in austria itself who are opposing the austrian extreme right and its demagoguery .    3.9445793811192957
our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution , their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious .    3.3097058240144475
some of these parties , despite declaring themselves to be UNK and democratic , adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right , either out of UNK or as a vote - winning UNK , if only in openly and hypocritically UNK the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment , and generally making their lives more difficult .    3.4176980342600327
more generally , those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various states of the european union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy , devoted exclusively to the interests of big business , has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it UNK , and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right .    3.6393581493784772
this week we heard the first political cry of the new - born europe .    3.4826132815392334
by staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of jörg haider ' s xenophobic and anti - european party in the austrian government , a situation without precedent since the second world war , the european union has come into its political UNK and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial community , a large market , a " europe of shopkeepers " .    4.155521638871331
it is a part of its future which is at stake right now , part of its very essence , its heart and soul .    4.108031849627344
the european parliament was the first to speak up .    3.799524286075092
the appeal by the european socialists , on the initiative of olivier UNK , raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this UNK of and intolerable situation .    4.118352395372529
a firm attitude which the 14 european states have demonstrated unanimously and promptly , through mr guterres , by condemning the risk of the austrian political situation getting out of control .    3.2152264645037
this courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of europe .    2.9590769992438575
a return to the roots , at last , for a community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history UNK by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance .    3.421770194103922
europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events .    3.4239520454796875
however , as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will , since the sanctions stipulated under article 7 of the treaties are virtually impossible to apply , will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure ?    3.981460858531164
the whole credibility of europe is at stake today , before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow .    3.5101301565621914
from now on europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition .    3.5152552761292464
at this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo - nazis in the government of a european union member state , i must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone .    3.9512570344595512
i am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the european parliament , after its excellent political debate yesterday , should not adopt a stance on this matter .    3.3679408752373283
personally , however , i shall continue to fight against the extreme right , to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of austria , and to organise a major public demonstration in UNK on saturday at 3 p . m .    3.8337273380729138
fascism and neo - nazism are UNK !    3.3387827371269134
the foul monster has been UNK !    4.039901099160368
for me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might .    3.3835257839454957
europe was born out of a desire for peace , freedom and tolerance .    3.8763929881221766
there is no question of it allowing xenophobic , racist and anti - UNK ministers to be tolerated at within it .    2.9326221783202655
do not count on me to keep quiet , without doing or saying anything .    3.0104116710338005
in yesterday ' s debate in the european parliament some members of this parliament expressed worry that we were interfering in the internal affairs of a member state .    4.062370376822521
such a concern is UNK .    3.2813583192273725
the european parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in member states with which they disagree .    3.980952912629719
we have condemned basque and irish terrorism .    2.9102121233548552
we have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities .    3.277320657081616
it is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the european union , to comment on current political developments in austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament .    4.256408830801585
by commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in austria from forming a coalition government .    3.571821251156222
we are nonetheless , as is our right as well as our responsibility , telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand .    3.806706953369902
others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement .    3.845746858774625
in reaching an agreement with jörg haider and his party , the austrian christian democrats would at a UNK be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power - both of which they will utilise as a launching UNK for even greater electoral success .    3.2246302755970455
that is why the european union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in austria .    3.003010753436003
- ( sv ) we have voted in favour of the common resolution in order to express our solidarity with all those who are exposed to xenophobia and racism .    3.426829841708992
we have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the UNK politics that jörg haider stands for .    2.9373494512362055
we are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 member states have employed on this issue .    3.2363566072092724
the resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the member states ' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with article 6 of the treaty .    3.499465234200398
what is also missing is a paragraph concerning the eu ' s shared responsibility for the social and political developments in europe and austria which have been among the prior conditions for mr haider ' s electoral success .    4.246509770120129
the policy of cut - backs which has followed in the wake of UNK to emu has promoted the successes of right - wing extremism .    2.9140245848602433
a radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in europe .    4.2173771384875165
- ( de ) i am making this statement on behalf of the csu .    3.4137697058150827
it is intolerable that the eu should involve itself in the formation of the government in a member state .    3.1222827565826607
it has no right to do so .    3.0935334305677857
instead of prematurely condemning the fpö and the austrian government which is being formed , there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition .    3.7479365117218673
only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of europe .    4.1373215705607125
this does not mean that we sympathise with haider .    2.6779145090063188
the csu european delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the fpö .    3.26264246039823
however , as politicians we must ask the question why 27 % of the austrian population voted for a party such as the fpö at the elections in october 1999 .    3.6851172127712655
we must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results .    3.8779764090198956
however , the resolution of the european parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem .    3.9565292355248687
for these reasons the csu european delegates are against this resolution .    2.815561800842325
" he knew what those UNK UNK did not know but could have learned from books : that the plague UNK never dies or disappears for good ; that it can lie UNK for years and years in furniture and UNK - UNK ; that it UNK its time in UNK , UNK , UNK , and UNK ; and that perhaps the day would come when , for the UNK and the enlightening of men , it would UNK up its UNK again and send them forth to die in a happy city . "    4.2478489622895665
it is with these phrases that UNK UNK , at the close of the long allegorical novel UNK the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of UNK against the plague , reminds us , at the close of the second world war , that the fight against nazism , " the brown plague " as it was termed at the time , could not enjoy a definitive victory .    3.963835898211069
that because racial hatred , xenophobic violence , fear and rejection of what is different , have deep roots in all that is UNK in humanity , they may re - emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings .    3.4071287569220536
in this light , the events we are seeing in austria must be seen as tragic .    3.127008225679076
for the first time since the second world war , a party which is openly pro - nazi , racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a european country .    3.2347470222256702
confronted with this threat , which carries with it the UNK of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of europe , nothing must UNK us : not the legal UNK about what the treaty does or does not permit , not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene , not the derisory respect for formal democracy , and , above all , not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control .    4.212069900823464
as the representative for a french overseas department , the island of réunion , a land of racial and ethnic UNK , where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of europeans , UNK from africa or UNK , UNK men from india or pakistan , or even chinese , every day i experience the profound truth of the remark by saint - UNK , " in being different to me , you are not doing me harm , brother , but enriching me ! "    3.426729745400217
this human diversity is our main sources of wealth , and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it , wherever it may exist .    3.836761997620904
for all these reasons i voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this house on the formation of the government in austria .    2.7869529366105263
jörg haider ' s rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right - wing and fpö coalition government , is a sign of the terrible revival in europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth .    3.6322056605545248
the success of the austrian freedom party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter , whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right - wing populism .    3.5676639140895836
the resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of fascism .    2.9722631630952008
it can be explained by the feeling of UNK of the people who are the victims of the ideology of UNK UNK and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further .    3.90436852845246
this is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a ' european democratic model ' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks UNK , UNK and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers , when it is not opening files on UNK .    3.4626182969213786
- ( de ) i have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in austria in view of a possible government being formed between the övp and the fpö .    3.4643952393711577
i consider the casting of jörg haider as " europe ' s UNK " ( or even worse , neo - nazi and super racist ) to be counterproductive .    3.2096564495474706
of course i , in no way , agree with the publicised statements of this right - wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any UNK of the hitler regime .    3.4825801437424904
however , i fear that a purely emotional reaction by europe to the events in austria will only multiply haider ' s UNK .    3.290652427904419
the eu must not do him an invaluable UNK service .    2.784321211234988
the strength of the fpö can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility .    4.2116799980833495
it was only after they UNK UNK the fpö to tolerate a minority government and , obviously in vain , offered the freedom party ministerial posts , that the spö begin its massive campaign against haider .    3.5312754170902716
it turned its threatened loss of power into an " heroic battle for the preservation of values " and an imminent , pure - and - simple " decision between democracy and non - democracy " .    3.0751061817198306
this is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which i cannot UNK .    2.9691765500728327
we german christian democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly UNK ourselves from them .    2.855597864790513
we revealed the UNK of the republicans who were nationalistic , xenophobic and anti - minority .    3.7215491228497948
today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments .    3.42339538974075
the german approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again .    3.0742261237837556
it cannot be copied arbitrarily since each member state has its own specific conditions .    3.2822509023577897
the övp ( austrian people ' s party ) , whose presence at european level we have also come to take for granted , is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of UNK in austria .    3.9366881312693423
it can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles .    2.888543537684095
the council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government .    3.3299649767869037
this condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the austrian republic .    3.253083980741601
sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye .    3.2101017312810907
we must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left .    2.964508950856521
i would have liked to see the same outrage in europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the UNK to the UNK and UNK regime in the UNK .    4.1825838043697114
in the meantime , they have been forming governments in german federal states .    3.2249635735579267
i fully support the statements made by commissioner prodi in today ' s session .    3.7205396476760586
he spoke of the task of not isolating member states but of doing everything to unite them in common european values .    3.6504900443171127
- ( fr ) i voted against the joint resolution on the situation in austria .    3.281573412523511
austria is a free , independent and sovereign country .    3.1508152465211494
consequently , neither the council , the commission nor the european parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a member state .    4.317060820024948
the austrian elections were held in a free , proper and democratic manner .    3.406729252008134
any interference by the european institutions in this country is therefore unacceptable ; it is in violation of the european treaty ( article 7 of the treaty of amsterdam ) .    5.089067868363836
nevertheless , these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept turkey as a candidate for membership of the european union , despite its well - known human rights violations .    2.853793550912112
nothing of this nature has yet occurred in austria .    3.2056598952791813
this precedent , created on the initiative of the portuguese presidency , is a worrying one as far as the future of the european union is concerned .    4.370017066875051
on the one hand , the political UNK of austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of UNK thought . on the other hand , if tomorrow the governments of european union member states must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies , then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed .    3.7466865134203258
in such circumstances will it even be worth having elections ?    3.24371823156742
this is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future .    4.129925966247537
- ( fr ) the vote which has just taken place in this chamber is a historic one for it is the first time we have ever debated the internal political situation of one of our member states with such anxiety .    4.075475232577316
i believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is UNK .    3.493333059610177
i urge the council and the council presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the union .    4.338470118003949
i urge the commission to be less cautious .    3.308894902020292
in this resolution , parliament is assuming its responsibilities .    3.716448076532043
having said that , in my opinion , the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum , the very least we could do .    3.595128010404607
personally i argued in favour of a rather harder line , and i supported amendments nos 1 , 4 , 6 , 7 and 8 , as well as the oral amendment tabled by the socialist group .    4.075070686584966
in fact i consider it essential for the council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an austrian government which includes members of the austrian freedom party .    4.153578382466797
including jörg haider ' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in europe , and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other union member states or in candidate countries .    3.7112611914200793
the austrian people ' s party must accept some historical responsibility for this .    3.1006594697800285
it is our fundamental values which are at stake here . as the democratically elected representatives of the european people , we have no choice .    4.640177572968122
we must reject what is unacceptable , as our constituents demand .    3.4132627167874565
i abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution .    3.814424970746412
i condemn jörg haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy .    3.2703191970575056
however , i cannot accept that an eu body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one member state .    3.211723182704567
i cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution , and i cannot vote in favour of the resolution , even though it would be a vote against the extreme right .    3.9555703253040995
- ( sv ) obviously , the political leaders of europe have a right and a duty to react against mr haider and his party .    3.4300456458837063
the political leaders of europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another member state , just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority .    3.407459432238512
finland ' s experience , however , is that integration , rather than isolation , is the better way of combating UNK forces .    4.507379806583046
i therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution , which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights .    3.2059664464132895
the eu presidency ' s " common reaction " against the formation of the government in austria is legally unjustified .    3.059668050337194
the treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 member states .    2.8661379573656807
nor should we isolate the forces in austria which wish to work for human rights .    3.3397491635648624
despite these objections of mine to the council ' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics , it was important to show clearly where the european parliament stands on questions of racism , which is why i voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote .    4.340743328521737
that concludes the vote .    2.6091606668742218
adjournment of the session    2.8230669262419874
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned .    3.0712869809919257
( the sitting was closed at 12 . 25 p . m . )    2.109794822472653
resumption of the session    2.5077205603491106
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday 3 february 2000 .    2.646239057999769
approval of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.6618103961920436
the minutes of the sitting on thursday 3 february have been distributed .    2.6788451310133223
are there any comments ?    2.070454319710833
i can see from your reaction that many of the members of parliament have not received the minutes and clearly you cannot approve minutes which you have not seen .    3.8568188375470345
i therefore propose to submit the minutes for your approval tomorrow morning , since obviously you do not have them and i must apologise for this .    3.539927598478476
i shall therefore postpone the approval of the minutes .    2.873387882042696
madam president , on a point of order .    2.0707826220316585
the bbc this morning reported that a british member of this house , holding a senior position within his delegation , continues to offer strategic advice to private clients , but does not state in the register of interests who these clients are .    3.156410335878028
the people of europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit , but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible .    3.9637027036080084
madam president , since these matters are currently being considered by the quaestors , may i ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the register of interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and , above all , to ensure that the register is not only available for inspection by this house , but is also published on the internet ?    3.973747189022082
thank you , mr davies .    2.6525138698709294
i shall look into this matter with the college of quaestors .    3.019166249525152
madam president , on a point of order .    2.0707826220316585
as this is the first valentine ' s day of the new millennium i hope that you will agree with me that it would be fitting for this house to mark this day by making a firm commitment to tackling heart disease , the biggest killer in the european union .    3.7500601550081067
i would urge members to sign up to the commitment made today at the winning hearts conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least 65 without suffering from UNK UNK disease .    3.393946928795471
happy valentine ' s day !    3.709118242908524
madam president , i rise under rule 9 of the rules of procedure of this house and UNK to the same point raised by mr davies about the very serious allegations made on bbc radio this morning .    3.792671987630501
i would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two members who were named in this particular bbc interview are not running their companies from this parliament or from parliamentary offices , because that would be a very serious matter indeed .    3.809160950818936
in the past the british conservatives ' double standards have brought the united kingdom ' s house of commons into UNK , and there is a very real danger that such behaviour would have a similar impact on this parliament .    3.8866618115697036
thank you , mr UNK .    2.5378615957771524
as i informed mr davies , i promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors .    3.0818258410527153
madam president , on a point of order .    2.0707826220316585
i have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the house .    3.403339030604505
i wonder on what point of order mr davies was speaking .    3.4579275364482895
why did he not mention the fact that one of his own liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the bbc ?    3.9585645516116834
is this house going to let its agenda be determined by UNK reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies , or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing europe ?    3.1659243478680934
gentlemen , obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be UNK their assessment just on information from radio programmes .    3.8669021473602676
they will look into the matter thoroughly .    3.3687913730022156
madam president , i believe i am expressing the feeling of a great number of members of parliament in most of the political groups when i say that the message which the president of the commission sent to the new austrian chancellor a week ago created some unease .    4.443754872667386
was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success , or to say , " i am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms " , or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation ?    3.3888280628750937
this is why , madam president , i should like to see mr prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words , so that nobody , absolutely nobody , can use this message , which is unusual and unwise , to say the least , to contribute , and that includes counter to the intentions of mr prodi , towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in austria a commonplace .    3.8866995097252084
thank you , mr wurtz .    2.556866912288952
i would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , not to start a debate at this point . this was just a procedural motion .    3.33044275948647
let me remind you , mr wurtz , that we shall be seeing mr prodi tomorrow . he is going to make a statement on the commission ' s programme .    4.110890460660271
naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement , just as mr prodi will be perfectly free to answer you .    3.6438180723847897
madam president , it is with great regret that i have to trouble you yet again with an issue that i have raised here twice before .    4.107286828220181
i have already told you on a number of occasions that we , on behalf of the dutch UNK , would like a dutch television channel .    3.7763340723970042
there are now 28 channels here in this parliament , including two greek , one portuguese , one finnish and one belgian , but still no dutch , and as many as seven english , six german and six french .    3.450242155083148
i was promised back in september that there would be a dutch channel by january .    3.52048273986312
it is now february and we are still waiting .    4.044130573364851
i would ask you once again to work on this .    3.3917688989220505
i wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite .    2.9923631183842057
mrs plooij - van gorsel , let me say how disappointed i am , because i personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago .    3.3113307023901695
i have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and i believe that mrs banotti has an answer for you .    3.8742062294816066
i shall therefore , with your permission , give the floor to mrs banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion .    2.9573451628454315
madam president , as my dear friend UNK will know , i will do anything to make her and my dutch colleagues happy .    3.745492874490855
i would like to assure you as UNK in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio , and i have already started UNK colleagues in this connection .    4.10374726946906
if it is of any comfort to her , the irish have not got their channel yet either .    3.464835392007814
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this .    2.7457170115135825
i am not so sure that our dutch members will be reassured on the grounds that the irish members too are unable to receive a national channel .    3.3824243708642334
i think we must do what we can to see that all members can receive their own national channel .    3.256988967188789
madam president , i should like to tell mr wurtz that the commission ' s doctrine is not the UNK doctrine of limited sovereignty and that , until proved otherwise , we are not in the situation where articles 6 and 7 would be applicable .    4.084235132969296
austria , therefore , is perfectly entitled to form its government and the president of the commission is perfectly entitled , and even duty bound , to offer austria his best wishes .    4.061712192007897
agenda    3.515252916915767
the next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents , pursuant to rule 110 of the rules of procedure .    2.1095156865336424
a ) sittings from 14 to 18 february 2000 in strasbourg relating to wednesday :    2.9624194605561476
president .    3.0050080721717225
in view of the fact that no council representative is able to attend on wednesday evening , a number of groups - the group of the european people ' s party , the group of the party of european socialists , the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , the group of the greens / european free alliance , the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left - requested that the council statement on the cyprus question and mr brok ' s report on the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta were dealt with during the joint debate and that these two items plus mr swoboda ' s report were brought forward in the agenda .    2.940656738361736
this would then give us , for wednesday ' s sitting , the two council statements on the coherence of union policies with development policy and on the un ' human rights ' sitting , followed by the joint debate on cyprus and then the reports by mr swoboda , mr corrie , mrs frassoni and mr knörr borràs .    3.628877608501035
is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal ?    2.7691575626281693
since no one wishes to speak , i shall put this proposal to the vote .    4.597168809728295
( parliament gave its assent ) relating to thursday :    2.4784052393590934
president . i have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance .    3.0062752921335396
on the subject of human rights , i have received two proposals for additions : one from the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party for an item entitled ' cambodia ' and the other from the group of the greens , for an item entitled ' pinochet ' .    3.5004317456430827
as you know , we can only include five items in the ' human rights ' section .    2.9910267265284385
according to the list given in the final version of the agenda , there are already four items .    4.81497198787527
we can therefore table only one additional item .    2.9111755760030977
who wishes to speak on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party to propose the addition of an item on cambodia ?    2.693357180185628
madam president , it is remarkable that the european parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of mr pinochet , despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued .    4.000039841911895
since the belgian government ' s appeal to a higher court was declared admissible last week and since the decision has essentially not yet been taken , it is important for parliament to at last give out a strong message , a message which should UNK that nobody can escape a just trial .    3.829255067296982
it is inconceivable that the european parliament , which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this .    3.4490077799362764
madam president , this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time .    3.576940444727473
firstly , the european parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of general pinochet , but , furthermore , there are certain questions to be borne in mind .    4.456239773179097
the first is that this matter is sub UNK in several european countries , and i would like to remind members that there is still no european judicial area nor a european legal system .    3.5366968211245795
we are in favour of the international criminal court , but it does not yet exist .    3.98324659679498
secondly , there is currently a democratically elected government in chile , led by UNK UNK , whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice , and i would remind you that the UNK justice system , which is independent , is currently examining 60 complaints lodged against general pinochet , concerning his crimes against humanity .    3.7467719340541237
i believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up , but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure .    4.40054883121456
we believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .    4.214862130855268
( parliament rejected the proposal ) president .    2.455239514716317
we now come to the third proposal which is for ' environmental disasters in the waters of the danube ' , a proposal tabled by the group of the greens / european free alliance .    3.4516090122406
is there a member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?    2.2003377269882054
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , what has occurred in a tributary of the danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the chernobyl disaster .    3.201167104485418
it affects not only romania , but also yugoslavia and , in fact , the entire danube basin .    4.590065183213157
we consider the matter to be important enough for the commission to react swiftly to this situation , and i think that parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .    4.3591876424077824
( parliament gave its assent ) president .    2.21391344070833
still relating to thursday ' s sitting , the ppe group has requested that mrs cederschiöld ' s report on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro should be brought forward to wednesday as the last item on the agenda .    2.828863121475219
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the ppe in favour of this proposal ?    2.443744756028895
madam president , the agenda has been UNK so many times that i would simply ask the chamber to support the present proposal .    4.82192085534709
it is not a very time - consuming matter , but it is extremely important that it should get through parliament now and that there should be no delays .    3.7809629453168374
it is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting , which is an extremely urgent matter .    3.858272645729742
i should therefore be very grateful indeed if the chamber could support it .    3.3082521532798874
( parliament gave its assent )    2.0659013727593916
relating to friday : president .    2.9149510842572837
relating to friday , on friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the group of the party of european socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in brussels , as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda .    3.4266210763364313
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the pse group in favour of this proposal ?    2.4045963898890204
madam president , with apologies to my friend , UNK barón crespo , i should like to speak against this proposal .    3.5029515227607684
i am surprised it has even been made , because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the conference of presidents .    3.705026159375376
i think that your proposal , madam president , to keep the debate and the vote separate , with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date , is a reasonable one .    3.9846147611349823
the reason is as follows : this issue concerns no less than 1 800 000 employees within the european union .    3.1279694915474363
it is not an old one , it was issued in 1997 .    3.6823258352707993
deciding upon future policy lines , with a view to a new directive , rather hastily , without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners , i feel , runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators .    3.936150377332536
i propose , therefore , that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda , with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date .    3.6325102892217456
madam president , i clearly owe mr wurtz an explanation , and i am going give this explanation before the whole house .    3.5398819813470923
we had reached this agreement on principle in the conference of presidents .    3.1444434425227556
at the time , i did not know that commissioner bolkestein was going to appear next week before the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism to discuss this matter .    3.3431663973668115
my group has debated this matter and considers that , given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area , it is appropriate that parliament makes an initial statement , regardless of any action it may take in the future , so that commissioner bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week ' s debate .    4.482352249150652
madam president , i should simply like to ask mr wurtz to take a second look at what this is about .    4.021703934882256
it has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance ; it is just about the following question : when will the commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive ?    3.953949083610978
our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to , and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible .    3.617381043560539
that is why i should like to support the social democrats ' request to hold the vote on friday .    3.9245612163168384
madam president , as you know the cederschiöld report has been taken off thursday ' s agenda . that ought to mean that we have more time on thursday .    3.9263969175372475
since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate , in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half , i simply wanted to ask whether the UNK services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time .    3.8456271014692427
in general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very UNK .    3.972051090601223
last thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one - and - a - half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote .    3.3708072725242335
on friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda .    3.1442099845723894
that is absolutely absurd .    2.8809556401772536
i really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed .    4.373225606119234
this sounds perfectly feasible . we shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour , considering the withdrawal of mrs cederschiöld ' s report .    3.3235202096235827
this is all i am talking about here , just that .    3.2515257998440457
madam president , i would like to talk about an item on the agenda for wednesday , which you have not yet announced .    3.838066298311929
i understand that there is no argument about the fact that the council declaration , on the next sitting of the united nations commission on human rights , is not going to include the declaration on the UNK anniversary of the geneva conventions , and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part - session in march , so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way .    4.433111731693065
i understand that there is agreement on this issue .    3.3419983345972573
madam president , this afternoon , in this chamber , reference was made to a series of reports on the bbc today programme this morning , which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow UNK their position as members of this house .    3.4708520085915757
these are serious allegations .    2.909327372139898
they are completely UNK , UNK , politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their UNK .    3.6565796857394206
we are taking legal advice .    3.071967763790426
my colleagues ' register of interests is complete .    3.118470595884822
if we find that any member of this house or their employees UNK with the bbc in this UNK we will UNK them to the UNK of this house .    4.535819016266647
quite , we agree absolutely .    3.2762179043973836
b ) sittings of 1 and 2 march 2000 in brussels    4.305072681347778
sustainable urban development - rural development - equal initiative    4.410342404473164
. ( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioners and members of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i was given the task of drawing up the european parliament ' s report on the community initiative programme interreg iii .    3.0903087618529534
before discussing the content of the resolution , i should like to inform you of the elements which i took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur .    3.816369646210373
first of all , i would like to remind you of the function of the interreg community initiative , founded on the principle of UNK and innovation .    3.230307842139828
interreg is one of the four community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000 - 2006 , and is the one with the largest budget for implementation , i . e . eur 4 . UNK billion as opposed to eur 3 . UNK billion at the present time .    3.389220298842093
the interreg initiative , created in 1990 , is built upon the wish to make the regions of europe ready for a ' europe without frontiers ' in the context of establishing the great single market .    3.6370689877941387
at the time of the reform of the structural funds in 1994 and 1996 , the interreg cip has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans - european transport and energy distribution networks .    3.686600863358169
these programmes promoted cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation within the european union by encouraging balanced development of the community area .    3.4337286320077514
the interreg iii programme , for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the european commission , pursuant to the terms of european community regulation no 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the structural funds , continues these measures .    3.7093931104188336
it is based on three strands . strand a organises cross - border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions , at both internal and external borders of the european union , on the basis of joint cross - border development strategies which member states ' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing . strand b governs transnational cooperation between national , regional and local authorities in various member states or applicant countries regarding regional development , transport networks and the environment .    3.659087937572654
member states , i . e . national authorities , are responsible for implementing this strand . finally , strand c organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the member states or third countries to exchange experience under strands a and b and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development , subject to consultation with the european commission which is responsible for its implementation .    4.068733028641162
the new interreg programme , in the form in which we have received it , takes into consideration the needs UNK by enlargement to the countries of eastern and central europe and to island regions and most remote regions .    4.09277560230396
the commission proposes redistributing the interreg funding as follows : between 50 and 80 % for strand a , 6 % for strand c , and the remainder for strand b , i . e . from 14 up to a maximum of 44 % .    3.5952801994046237
the european commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand a and strand b . it bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period .    2.8508365167771603
the most remote regions may benefit from support under strand b . the commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand a is not comprehensive , but is comprehensive for strand b . the commission reserves the option to , at a later date , put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions , for strand c .    3.206748091431997
the adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on structural funds .    3.938391166296913
proposals are drawn up by member states and are submitted for approval to the european commission , which checks their UNK with the general guidelines , adopted .    4.947588140457571
these proposals must include a number of elements , an overview of the cross - border or transnational priorities and strategies , a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan .    3.497757924131431
i belong to the great majority of members of parliament who voted in favour of continuing the interreg community initiative programme . i regret that parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme , which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency , but i acknowledge that this was not an easy operation .    4.073119723591135
i also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in , as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on 24 november last year and then on 26 january . i further regret the fact that neither the regions , nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme .    3.9641210496137615
in promoting cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation , this cross - disciplinary instrument is the very UNK of a regional policy on the european scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the community territory .    3.7249910331845397
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , the conference on rural development held in cork from 7 to 9 november 1996 set rural development as one of the european union ' s priorities since it is essential in order to maintain the existence and continued development of agriculture , to provide farmers with an environment containing the necessary infrastructure and services , and to ensure greater respect for the environment and a better quality of life , diversification and job creation .    3.154766839153356
in its 1998 policy paper , agenda 2000 , the commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based : the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas .    4.046429463576329
the second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector , so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented . in this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the cap .    4.1737835304377136
the leader community initiative was launched in 1991 to promote a new bottom - up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs .    2.9408454455380446
the following objectives were set : improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative ; promoting the UNK of knowledge in the rural development sector ; disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas .    3.269497345866167
leader i applied to the rural areas covered by structural fund objectives 1 and 5b , and UNK local action groups participated in it , with financing of eur 1 UNK million .    3.5677222182918875
leader ii ( 1994 - 1999 ) , for which a total evaluation has , unfortunately , not yet been completed , had a wider scope than leader i : there were probably over 800 beneficiaries and the sums allocated , after reallocation of resources , probably amounted to over eur 4 000 million .    3.4170619912860345
in october 1999 , following the success of leader i and leader ii , the commission decided to extend the initiative .    4.093312446021683
for the 2000 - 2006 period provision has been made , unfortunately , only for a total contribution of eur 2 020 million , and an indicative allocation for each member state has been set .    3.847048824460337
leader + differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible . it is also more ambitious , and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet .    4.052427963083469
the main changes are as follows : all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from leader + ; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous ; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes , such as the use of information technology , improving the quality of life , and adding value to local products .    3.5453568669969955
i therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because , as i was saying , it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious , even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population UNK .    3.931048015772496
i believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the union and i repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence , such as the UNK .    4.219552523412236
i share the commission ' s preference for the use of global grants while urging , however , that the accounting requirements of national and regional authorities should be precisely and UNK defined .    3.678342229542782
i regret the delay with which leader , as was the case with the other three initiatives , was presented to parliament and for the knock - on delay this entailed for the whole procedure .    3.916232549272649
finally , i am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated , if you consider , in addition , that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous leader ii .    5.011219684607028
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , my report on equal takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new community initiative , whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .    3.2009795016791096
this community initiative succeeds the two UNK programmes adapt and employment and has a much smaller budget of around eur 2 . 8 billion .    3.409190578043406
the initiative adopts a completely new approach , which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships .    3.5120661386764245
the intention is clear : targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level , projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities .    3.4707726213213195
this objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this house .    3.7489451452589115
in addition , equal should feed into the national action plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these action plans .    3.3458527654920545
in my report i have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships .    3.4701811651379284
i consider technical support to be necessary but , given the problems with the former taos , no new taos should be set up without parliament ' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level .    4.285890613714319
nevertheless , technical assistance is necessary .    3.443491867997578
particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice , with special emphasis on mainstreaming .    3.2840916334878747
i have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report .    3.87618158702961
this has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises .    3.4593825929041278
a compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers .    3.5518828355335375
however , in this context , madam president , to allow us to work out the details , i should like to request that the vote on the equal report be held not tomorrow but on wednesday .    3.8737789058908763
i believe that it is important for the community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the european parliament , because parliament put the appropriations for equal in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that members ' ideas were also reflected in this community initiative .    4.1660953825664455
in this connection , the european parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in parliament .    3.491259531789126
equal should live up to its name , and this is my firm intention .    3.95324477313282
it should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the european union .    3.549655680296057
it should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life .    3.0975579851097037
everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin .    3.369897530029815
that is my intention and i would ask the house to give this report overwhelming support !    4.060810684633144
madam president , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new urban community initiative and it is an achievement that i am here tonight because air france cancelled my flight at 2 . 10 p . m . but i am here !    4.410973251446518
just a year ago when the commission produced its proposals around agenda 2000 it UNK the urban initiative .    3.763713671874265
yet we as politicians knew that there was a UNK of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000 .    3.7473765909421446
urban policy has always been at the forefront of eu policy .    3.3401996628412274
in my member state , for example , we are developing a strategic approach in a white paper and an urban government UNK is looking at the problems of urban communities .    4.363964670014984
with eight out of ten people in europe living in urban areas , it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation , social exclusion , UNK , crime , drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that .    4.189992818219984
for example , in my own region , in manchester , the urban community initiative has been a tremendous success .    3.9058369066760017
urban funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the uk , in UNK side .    3.797208318827828
the work of this urban agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous british pubs .    3.1061002702111837
this is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the eu in terms of communication and publicity .    4.325276067537064
as regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative , they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity .    3.770009679522532
we agree that they ought to be indicative in nature , allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes .    3.5551294554374073
in committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 50 .    4.493942058229325
we are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of 50 is not the key factor .    4.045881881666069
instead , we should go for good - quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal , to attract UNK investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect .    3.2627845367589745
the member states should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations .    4.266283330660108
in the designation of local urban programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas .    3.4620324024551237
in the uk the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and UNK to help determine not only eu but national and regional assistance programmes .    3.6975522565231986
this needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the eu criteria .    4.192302231937082
i would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that .    3.092814041638319
often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency .    3.0878436973095504
this is all too familiar in many of our urban areas .    3.335292442704421
all these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents , yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity .    3.6749478457110256
that is why again , in my report , i have asked that action under the urban programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem : these areas do not have single , " UNK " problems .    4.103202394067274
instead , communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems , using eu resources as a value added to local actions .    3.0594671597723404
i would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti - discrimination , as provided for in the amsterdam treaty .    2.9678872939618555
the community initiative means community involvement .    3.3157006043459494
some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents .    3.4401143442795497
we need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes .    3.262380757479513
the time - scale therefore proposed by the commission is very ambitious .    4.28433867137277
it is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation .    2.773964711898612
the commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also UNK the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice .    3.7334040227986396
this is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks .    3.772719061299536
finally , i should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post - industrial city we require local participation .    3.8390520417750684
we need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the UNK skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .    3.3529433848090835
we shall thereby be able to replace poverty , dependency and UNK with equity , initiative and participation .    3.658595566792803
this will help us to restore the credibility of the eu and the confidence of citizens that europe can deliver local action to solve local problems .    3.8970498538704317
. ( it ) mr president , as the rapporteur , mrs mccarthy , has already pointed out , we can certainly consider urban a success for the european parliament with regard to the debate held last year on the reform of the regulations .    4.482274682710559
as we have heard , the objective of urban is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas , bearing in mind that 80 % of the population of europe lives in cities .    3.639839146219211
creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long - term job creation , action to combat poverty , measures to assist low - income groups and old people , facilities for children , racial and ethnic integration , better opportunities for participation , a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures .    3.466758722091112
the communication from the commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic , social , and infrastructural measures .    4.1320694481103475
however , we must remember that , in addition to urban , a number of other community instruments are also available in the social sector : innovative actions under article 6 of the esf regulation , pilot projects , particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the european parliament under the 2000 budget and the equal and interreg initiatives and mainstream esf activities .    3.887321993234887
while , on the one hand , we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary , we would on the other hand urge the commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved .    4.3961305292335
not only is this coordination essential but , as we stated in our opinion , exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential .    3.99956825513198
that situation will be compounded by social UNK resulting from european union enlargement , and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities .    4.173597178554323
addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities ' historical and cultural role .    3.8726187737979494
however , in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis .    4.179693463267227
here , we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women , and the agencies that represent them , in planning and implementing the urban initiative programmes .    4.295936700594445
as the committee on equal opportunities , we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women , mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments , and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations , social solidarity .    3.8812760254646954
effective implementation of this initiative could have a UNK result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels , thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of european policy in their day - to - day life in real terms .    3.7360848909838236
mr president , our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the commission for the urban programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention .    3.361003232915321
in committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand - in - hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by urban .    3.954523205639299
we considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration .    3.4296786797664267
our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole UNK of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning , action to prevent juvenile delinquency , the reintegration of offenders , and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved , for example the police , the courts and social services .    3.4073471998689513
we adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue urban - which in the past has been implemented successfully - because , as we see it , programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the european union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the european union enjoy peaceful coexistence .    4.995902570634423
for this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind .    3.058090997838761
i should like to comment on the concerns which the committee on employment and social affairs has with regard to the largest of the four community initiatives , interreg iii .    3.20902306833922
it must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under interreg iii .    3.3950718090037975
in the light of the fact that 50 % of unemployment in the union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions - i need only refer to the possibility of UNK migration - this is not only reasonable but imperative .    4.552571941847749
the measures eligible for funding listed in annex ii of strand a do also seem encouraging in this respect .    2.8727099715757
in reality , however , the commission communication does not contain a single provision for the member states with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects .    4.549538147160465
i should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures , especially in areas with high levels of long - term and youth unemployment .    3.418057179006115
in general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis - because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level - so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing .    3.52125693228935
the fact that administrative expenditure on interreg iii is - in my opinion - still excessive is something which we can and indeed always must criticise , although it almost seems to me as though this is unavoidable with the commission ' s support programmes .    4.318891284871856
however , i should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal . it is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the eu is once again given the importance which it deserves .    4.665391476229052
mr president , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism considered , amongst other things , the report on leader + and , as a result , agreed to support the process of decentralisation in the management of actions , believing that that process could be effective on two conditions : that local action groups represent the general interests of the local community , and that commission control mechanisms are utilised to prevent local and regional political authorities from using leader + resources to support civil groups and organisations which are related to those authorities .    3.479000271330814
we ask for a guarantee that the decision - making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements : political representatives and public administrations , companies and economic operators , and social operators , including unions and non - governmental organisations .    3.2525687060621316
we would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development , whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself , and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes , included in objectives 1 and 2 , and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located .    4.024515649209714
we are pleased that all the rural areas of the union may be involved in leader + , but we believe that it is necessary to concentrate community resources in the less - favoured regions in order to facilitate the process of socio - economic cohesion within the union , and that state governments should not divert these resources towards objectives other than cohesion .    4.610640021201644
the committee believes that projects financed under action 1 should place value on the potential of UNK development , in particular based on local traditions , techniques and practices , on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy .    3.5892700386346066
the committee supports the commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that , given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations , the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to 10 000 inhabitants .    3.3318409607669937
we believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3 , financed by leader , with those of other actions financed by other community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership , such as interreg , UNK , phare , tacis and meda , in the same areas .    3.8179401029565687
mr president , mrs stenzel , ladies and gentlemen , before addressing the equal report itself , i should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based .    3.6517669888118975
the basic objectives of an eu - wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability , entrepreneurship and adaptability .    3.4748136210808043
these objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and UNK as possible to the economy .    3.6132432473754514
however , the aim of an approach which really sought to reduce discrimination effectively and in the long term would have to be people ' s self - determination .    4.319748666728659
only then does it stop being a question of economic UNK and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives .    3.2631138825393613
mrs stenzel ' s report has , however , turned out very well , at least where the prescribed guidelines are concerned .    4.633937415519789
all asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes , although this should be self - evident .    4.111593621100664
nevertheless the conservatives voted against this in the committee .    4.320730866494728
i would ask them the following questions : does your policy seek to UNK people ?    3.108353529277444
what is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so ?    3.7586373710503365
does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability ?    3.0304194264565276
it is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme , because there remains a shortcoming in the report .    3.621617401099661
particular emphasis is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more UNK should be built .    4.802360462977229
anyone who UNK men UNK UNK the career UNK and worries only about UNK places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not - and unfortunately that includes women - understood the concept of mainstreaming !    3.510814234890826
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism adopted this opinion on the equal report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one UNK .    2.7454680645523846
i am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible , the committee on employment and social affairs .    4.146603365859922
this cross - group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions , which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy , transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market .    3.4382838525506982
the members of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the commission proposal which they would criticise : firstly , for example , the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities ; secondly , the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the commission and thirdly , the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the commission and the technical assistance bodies .    4.157239213370507
that is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure .    3.8107051952768827
the committee based its conclusions on these critical comments .    3.041540644999305
we attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector , in tourism and in small and medium - sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium - sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change .    3.4934130317899172
dovetailing the activities under the community initiative with the european employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the equal programme .    4.172839370721341
we fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at european level as an integral part of the equal programme .    3.435737898105558
the specific target of deriving european added value brings the regional cooperation up to european level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators .    3.3246400017562108
this is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it .    3.755176535190107
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank the rapporteurs , who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time .    2.6123881056734146
however , criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee .    3.9801872653056383
the reports are late , and , in addition , they were very hastily discussed by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .    3.5388113640078314
our group is keen to stress the importance of cross - border activity under the interreg programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the european union .    3.1038841684295004
such important areas include the balkans and the adriatic region , but , in my opinion , we should not ignore cooperation with russia either .    3.96692111326894
our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the interreg , tacis , ispa and phare programmes .    3.5798437187636263
this coordination is at present lacking , and the commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it .    4.117889010961363
we here in parliament are waiting for the commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible .    3.472199255963599
it is of decisive importance to get local business , organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes .    3.0988929648111836
experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful .    3.4888332743071406
projects have often remained half - finished , and their efficiency has been UNK by administration and bureaucracy .    3.4172229350979424
we also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement .    3.2931070356949763
our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee .    3.3863196017173594
i would like to mention here again the urban report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statements , has dealt UNK with the issue of the minimum sum of eur 500 per inhabitant as per the commission ' s guidelines .    4.39893014035227
it will not work as an automatic target , but must be applied in the target area according to UNK conditions .    3.541282087342514
this is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn .    3.3892608835799134
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , interreg is one of the most european of all the structural funds .    3.1350869321784347
here , projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support ; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries .    3.4680350656747856
unfortunately this is only true for part of the money , that is only for the borders within the eu .    5.175230528195498
but it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross - border cooperation .    3.167143224936426
the regulation UNK that there is one , but there is not .    5.670033820380667
the fact is that the commission has not amended the regulation for years , although parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time .    3.7018268554771074
the practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be UNK .    3.5392847540266352
since 1996 , parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties .    4.31065679006835
nothing has happened !    3.4801737486439173
the difficulties are once again being allowed to persist , to the detriment of the regions concerned .    4.014094964223324
parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross - border cooperation , and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other commissioners .    4.124254952655141
we want a europe for the people and not a europe of paper - UNK !    4.340937426529961
mr president , a third of eu money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes .    3.109101906429898
according to my group , this is excellent if , as a result of this , deprivation within regions , towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved .    4.152461121515735
that is a question of solidarity and progress .    3.6451414592082116
but UNK out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending .    3.458473828820556
the local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience .    3.172149765833422
they find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes .    3.6543845046645056
since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted , local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux . the task of these experts is to gauge to what extent european commission officials would be prepared to approve plans .    3.497740758183782
in some cases , i get the impression that it is not about solidarity or alleviating the most desperate problems , but about propaganda and upholding vested interests in exchange for the european union ' s blessing .    3.5660447963542445
it seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co - financed by the european union .    3.093647041816492
too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux , consultation and control , and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place .    3.5435448776863536
after the planned accession of new member states with their 100 million inhabitants , the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current eu member states , this UNK will generate even more protest .    4.160108943948518
in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , the confederal group of the european united left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion , mr nogueira román , on leader .    3.0120098689039425
he was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas .    3.8268786722602277
if there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas , we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality .    3.6388610350721313
after all , innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without european funding .    3.0028825583527703
a second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils .    3.8524855488535708
the emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities , non - profit - making organisations and profit - making companies join forces .    3.5303852179536825
the discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied .    3.267991504028799
in this respect , one of the UNK considered is reminiscent of the dutch UNK model , the structurally planned cooperation between government , trade unions and employers ' organisations .    3.220739917835116
let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population .    3.290630120967673
so , really , these bodies should already provide for a balance , and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process .    3.564323186340675
my group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play , as their input in society is important in our view .    3.728668533762831
this could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short - sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start .    3.150099102368074
but the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that , unfortunately , democracy is not fully functioning yet .    3.9459173145570237
one of the objections is that , due to the restricted role of the elected bodies , businesses gain more influence .    3.9833133871777737
as long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few , it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils .    4.056205962406216
we believe in ' one man , one vote ' more than ' one share , one vote ' .    2.934419544418992
mr president , there are economic frontiers within the european union , and the internal market with the free movement of goods , persons , services and capital is fully operating at this time .    3.110763194156649
but for the internal market to work effectively and for the single european currency to be a success it is important that all regions within europe , of which there are over 100 , can economically compete within this very challenging environment .    4.214098600675071
there are poor regions within the union which need to be given european assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the european union structure .    4.461108672749318
that is why , when we look at the eu financial perspective between 1989 and 1993 , and 1994 and 1999 , we find such a large proportion of the eu budget was put aside for the administration of the european regional development fund and the european social fund .    3.934366448247631
there are twin problems that still remain for many regions in europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road , water treatment facilities and related transport networks ; secondly , the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long - term unemployment , which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of europe .    3.7381114798048514
there must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a europe of the cities alone .    3.7757173558459294
we need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small - and medium - sized enterprise sector in rural parts of europe as well .    3.5542264116585605
the core aspects of this debate this evening relate to the operation of the eu initiative programmes , namely , the new interreg iii initiative , equal and the leader + scheme .    4.563713358987358
between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the eu to promoting cross - border development , combating the problems of long - term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes .    4.070322749880826
mr president , quite a few towns and cities within the european union have to UNK with deprivation .    3.935870826385477
the member states do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately .    3.249011073430771
this is why it is useful for the european union to continue to support the member states and , if necessary , give additional support under urban .    4.42642525233358
over the next seven years , the commission ' s proposals concerning urban will entail a reduction in both the community budget and the number of areas standing to benefit .    4.304302547557758
in common with mrs mccarthy , i have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced .    4.209691259178287
it is desirable for member states to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget .    4.311273767795629
as far as the budget is concerned , as already stated , urban is there to support and complement national policy .    3.436708902110441
in order to generate extra means if necessary , i think it is entirely logical to turn first to the member states and private investors .    4.187555599020808
consequently , we cannot support amendment no 2 of the greens , as borne out in the committee meeting .    4.965068898267565
in addition , i am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood , especially where community contributions are concerned , should incentivise .    3.3224985410162486
structural support is said to cause subsidy - dependence .    3.4460288989590095
we would then be UNK ourselves .    3.2278805856865658
i would like to finish off by making a general comment on interreg .    2.5474645896489703
in my opinion , funding for cross - border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions .    3.6856077593121617
according to the report issued by the court of auditors on the year 1998 , this is not an imagined risk .    4.08263348000329
hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects .    3.6490208392391015
before i begin i will take the liberty of expressing my UNK at the way in which austria has been UNK by 14 council representatives .    4.063617379652901
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as part of the reform of the structural funds the community initiatives are being UNK to a total of four .    3.766214525245679
i welcome the continuation of interreg and the priority which it has been accorded .    3.932483726841188
however , the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems .    3.8954096438849795
the regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines , although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the structural funds .    4.432487120747424
there is no direct transition between interreg ii and iii , the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding .    3.434956982862479
that is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects .    2.7627847394057197
when interreg is implemented , it will need to be coordinated and UNK with the other financial instruments concerned .    4.922136958570219
this is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed .    3.8938365030953217
however , problems will arise in particular from the fact that under phare , for example , funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project - related , whereas interreg funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures - related basis .    3.5285936388124233
this will cause practical problems in the future , and i hope that despite this it will be possible to implement interreg effectively .    4.390812504704831
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the community initiative leader proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas .    2.9741794279520324
the preservation of this community initiative in particular , in the form of a new version - leader + - is therefore greatly to be welcomed .    4.1393530522583735
the new leader + programme now covers all rural areas in the european union , which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects .    3.550793841320935
it is important for there to be coordination between leader + and the other support initiatives in the european union , but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important .    3.5280862902986514
in this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under leader is very welcome .    3.1868761090232685
agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the leader initiative .    5.8417945350639675
in the same way , through the leader initiative , structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas .    3.2603992652625053
attention must be paid in the leader + programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas ; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result .    3.9867226038960997
leader must now move into the implementation phase .    3.5459313817251394
the operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the commission , which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible .    3.8984160018702143
five months are provided for this .    3.5269407648714624
that seems to me to be rather too long .    3.2345795326704554
efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times .    4.166234599084998
because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible .    3.1898969471016625
despite all the delight over the UNK of this community initiative leader + , i do still have one further concern .    4.249252211339863
in its proposal the commission called for an observatory for the leader + programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented .    3.42312303862874
for me this raises the following questions : who will work there ?    3.2320010766940963
how will these people be selected ?    3.0675730608923626
where , above all , will the required money come from , and where should this observatory be located ?    4.041534186858655
i do think , though , that the leader + programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks , which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the commission in any case .    4.1255541107839555
in addition , experience from other fields where UNK have been set up shows that , apart from rather UNK creating jobs , they are not of any great benefit .    3.5582212062973224
i would therefore call on the commission to fulfil its monitoring duties directly itself and to do all it can to ensure that leader + programmes run smoothly .    3.7041253519157946
mr president , the majority of the borders , which have divided europe for centuries , were UNK created , separating single UNK spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion .    3.4933924098655282
our internal borders , or what remains of them , no longer cause wars , but they do continue to generate economic UNK , social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of europe .    3.8318742645483437
the community ' s institutions are obliged to work towards overcoming these border UNK , which contradict the spirit of european unity .    4.203131949070373
the economic and social cohesion which we propose is based , by means of the interreg initiative , on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent .    3.893203810136818
interreg has always been at the heart of a genuine community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our european territory .    3.7160072506606063
although the european parliament supports this initiative , our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of interreg ii .    4.748340945115381
however , we are aware that we must not delay this third version further , since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway . the success of interreg is clear and that is the opinion of the local , regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects .    4.0306514625922
the people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together , of innovation , of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and UNK each other .    3.5311661735551207
there are many interesting questions relating to it , the monitoring centre , the principle of concentration etc . however , i would like to concentrate on the management bodies .    3.7520973005403273
we must create joint , interregional and transnational management bodies , in which all local and regional authorities , as well as economic and social operators , play an active role .    3.737314984022092
there must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .    3.6847256896702154
we must create a cross - border culture , and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation , UNK overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each member state , in each region and each municipality .    3.980227743841277
a project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication .    3.9693577493669645
during debates in committee , we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating interreg with other annual or UNK financial instruments , such as meda , tacis or phare .    4.080813264511649
this parliament ' s motion for a resolution has been very attentive to these difficulties , making proposals capable of solving them to the commission and setting reasonable deadlines for making the necessary changes .    4.20035911203195
mr president , my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the urban initiative , in ireland in particular , has been quite successful and i am keen that the european union make a further contribution in that area .    5.032105061694374
it is a sad fact that there are many hundreds , if not thousands , of communities in the european union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage .    3.867664944009349
even in member states and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos , in situations where there are inadequate facilities , where schooling is very poor , where the physical infrastructure is under - developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife .    3.535454323922186
it seems to me that in order for the european union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the european union it must give assistance to member states to demonstrate that the union works for these citizens and their families .    4.6025185138521305
the programme has been extremely successful in ireland , as indeed i know it has been successful in other countries .    4.211075069567628
it was quite slow in getting off the ground there , but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes .    4.047671208069671
it is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative .    3.0374435241436277
it would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the urban programme .    3.2206936971610616
i should like to make one further point before i conclude : we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious urban development policy .    3.4231438334443127
this , unfortunately , is not the case in ireland .    4.176945940804858
i applaud the innovative approach of the equal programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market .    3.581769325617507
the development partnerships are a very clever idea , even though they are experimental .    3.3979254996942996
i have two major concerns , however , about the development partnerships .    4.322545660981616
they should be accessible to smaller groups , accessible for them to be able to devise , implement and monitor the programmes .    3.316903911031676
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme .    3.0549008338598997
i have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon , so that it becomes accessible to everyone .    3.871093665487051
i am glad to see that this was accepted into the report , but i cannot agree with amendment no 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all .    3.405214174657093
my second concern was that some discriminated groups have specific problems , for example , disabled people ' s access to the workplace .    3.903138768158888
projects should also specifically address this problem .    3.4559499220063974
these concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes .    3.3783922382211498
i certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the west midlands .    3.5852610443916575
although i am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with UNK , having access to equal , i would support the possibility of access for all other asylum - seekers and refugees .    4.016820225150324
it is only fair and right for them to be able to access equal in the same way as everyone else .    3.531117007399306
thank you , mr president . ladies and gentlemen , with the leader report , rural development is very much to the fore .    3.985154693189412
this does not happen all that often and it is gratifying , especially as the leader programmes have been key elements in the union ' s rural development policy .    3.5592218604288
it must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning , but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as , for example , areas experiencing depopulation .    3.418513995712301
these programmes have , therefore , been important channels for UNK democracy , the rationale of the citizen for europe .    3.7012350198305044
so , the concept for leader + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .    3.331455759965825
one urgent question is therefore raised : why , when this programme has been successfully run for ten years , is leader + still classed as experimental ?    3.4648056212365486
are there so many other european schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful ?    3.055704542907616
for how much longer is the commission going to leave leader at the experimental stage instead of bringing it UNK as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development ?    3.9997897799226387
moreover , i wonder at the reduced guidelines to which the commission wishes to restrict leader + .    3.825519699799617
at a time when , commissioner , after seattle , we europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects , why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient ?    3.671416771257821
as an UNK , let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many - sided approaches .    3.4617894705236383
in this connection , the commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries .    3.0899792290481902
a better solution would be , as indeed the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism suggests , strengthened coordination between leader + and the community cooperation and partnership programmes , such as interreg , phare , sapard or meda .    2.8653078520861746
the fact is , showing solidarity with eastern europe , is all very well , but it is not enough .    3.0379568484100283
the tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south , particularly the countries around the mediterranean , must not be abandoned .    4.352517798797749
therefore , once more , we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision . codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type , which require cooperation and cross - disciplinary application .    3.760530329142465
mr president , i have a few very brief comments .    2.8080493393193513
we are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period . this is not very good at all .    3.794572711496094
programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory , while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud .    3.4671995933226323
the community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain UNK .    3.727354387514725
they must , however , not be UNK to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy , but must develop their own self - sufficient role .    4.983426477082666
for example , adapting equal to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations UNK this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts .    3.089556787802185
extending the leader initiative to every area in the union entails the risk of UNK deprived areas even more , to the benefit of more developed areas .    4.363151864380104
the interreg initiative must include eligible areas with special emphasis on border areas , islands and both mountain and non - mountain areas , such as the UNK of UNK in greece , whose omission from annex i of the commission ' s communication is ill - considered .    3.5368694376626144
mr president , rural development has been identified by this parliament and the commission as a priority policy area , and i would like to welcome here today the commissioner responsible , commissioner fischler .    4.28409266982189
our response to rural decline has come late in the day , but i suppose better late than never .    3.365234938319767
family farming is now recognised as central to the european agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed , certainly within the time - scale of agenda 2000 .    4.046116535131354
in my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms .    3.704405469214114
it UNK all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival .    3.918149906245021
as the commissioner knows , farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities .    3.347551191661115
for this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development .    3.260961602414716
in this regard leader has established itself as an effective development initiative .    3.024242421462092
it provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems .    3.213396564519453
the voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated .    4.3384168659447315
yet , through leader , there can be no UNK its effectiveness as an integral part of broader eu and national policy .    3.1219098817590094
in conclusion , while welcoming commission approval for leader + , i am concerned about the time delay between the ending of leader ii and the commencement of the new programme .    3.7916922558225226
i urge you to look seriously at this problem .    2.989574098845287
a break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers .    3.2928331095620864
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , having read the commission communication on the interreg iii initiative , and pointing out that i took part in the vote on mr decourrière ' s report within the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i should like not only to expressly reiterate our agreement in principle with the initiative as presented and , particularly in the context of interreg iii b , with the commission ' s recognition of activities contributing to the restoration of UNK run down due the level of prices in the agricultural sector , a sector in which many associations , especially UNK , are already making enormous investments in my own country .    3.5899609948498585
i should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand a of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand iii c and , finally , in requesting that members of the european parliament should be involved in the european observatory for cross - border , UNK and interregional cooperation .    3.796525314860973
i should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which , in the commission communication with reference to interreg iii and iii b , involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of natura 2000 , which i think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems , from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted .    3.843367081766843
finally , if the commission and the relevant councils of ministers permit , i should like to stress that the members of the european parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the interreg projects and , beyond that , of similar initiatives .    4.370742994925047
it would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned , otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens .    3.883392970348452
mr president , first of all , i would like thank the rapporteur of the equal report , mrs stenzel , very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us .    3.7674764345514204
equal is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light , doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds .    3.5424817143640417
this is an arduous task .    2.9603540407621556
this is why it is so hard to strike a balance , not only between the different countries or the different components , but especially between the different groups listed in the programme , and in fact this is what has UNK us to date .    4.160349622127611
comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another .    3.795681283651796
i , for my part , have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and i have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the european parliament devoting special attention to them .    4.174504915163202
although a few other groups have been mentioned , it is the member states , in particular , which are on the UNK .    4.851510496183161
for example , i know of one member state that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component , namely refugees .    3.9949705129971664
i would , therefore , ask the commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups .    3.9014093765658164
it should not be the case that one member state , under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle , can decide that all funding should go to one group .    3.6188709903208762
i think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which mr UNK has warned us so vehemently , to wit , that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend .    3.4979914646237207
this is not the case !    2.8473575852240365
it has to be redistributed time and again .    3.04667531627985
that is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .    5.026282167089491
i believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this parliament , and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance , can be solved .    4.283154871713675
i would just like to underline this - the situation is , of course , a little precarious - parliament has , for the sake of convenience and safety , placed the equal programme on the back burner for the time being , so that parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed .    3.8475430876934853
i believe that this is actually a good thing .    3.272753791103394
the position of parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear .    3.5653086993509038
the rules of procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful .    3.4684065892474143
mr president , there is no doubt that the interreg initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the european union .    2.9453710950772716
however , i should like to stress interreg ' s particular importance for the balkan area , where political developments and hostilities over the past few years have had major economic repercussions for neighbouring countries and especially for my own country , greece , which is the only member state on that long - suffering peninsula .    3.249475593261645
for greece , for the neighbouring countries italy and austria , but also for europe as a whole , the social and economic restoration of the balkans , bringing political stability , is a vitally important matter .    4.727950164587383
so far , some balkan countries have received aid from the phare and UNK programmes , while others have not .    3.2440776442020525
during the new programme period , in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations , such as ispa and sapard , it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of interreg with other financial aid to third countries .    4.059554420338183
accordingly , we welcome the related references in chapter 7 of the european commission ' s proposed general guidelines for interreg .    4.061148533194949
the efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally , and i say that because in the meda programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome , so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme .    4.339621751229865
i should like to end by saying that the planning of the new inter - state cooperation zones has taken no account of the mediterranean ' s geographical peculiarities , which would justify the creation of a special zone for coastal and island regions .    3.9616032285800746
we therefore ask the commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review .    3.27098558887678
i end by stressing the need for the european union to persist with such initiatives , which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions , and to foster their harmonious development .    4.002706276699512
and since this is st . valentine ' s day , as a former mayor of a regional city , i propose that we should all declare our love for all the european regions which need that love .    4.268731646047983
mr president , commissioner fischler , rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles : preservation of jobs , UNK of the countryside and , not least , local culture , because that is of the utmost importance .    3.6358275187585396
only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured .    3.8327495190445258
we can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the alps and they are devastating .    3.76625539092518
but i warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside .    2.991412340274439
and neither should we create structures which are UNK on subsidies and which will be dependent on them UNK .    3.9664394473306106
to really guarantee sustainability - a UNK which has , since it gained new currency , become relatively UNK of meaning , but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed , amongst other things , is an integrated approach in the countryside towards , for example , tourism and agriculture .    4.189705650370358
the investment needs to be UNK .    3.9397199110667787
young , creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside . if they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more .    3.5228752577108455
none of us think much of the principle of UNK , all - round distribution , and the pilot projects need to act , as it were , like avalanches and trigger other similar projects .    4.071189137009769
i would be in favour of supporting self - contained cycles of projects and , even though leader i and leader ii may have had shortcomings here and there , overall they were certainly positive .    3.66604271923801
i should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the nordic countries but also for UNK areas - the alps , the pyrenees and the sierra UNK , from where i have just returned - in respect of population size and density .    3.419098938188408
mr president , i want to talk about the equal report , especially the issue of the policy on refugees .    4.092207287357655
today , we are already discussing the austrian coalition government ' s policy on refugees because mrs stenzel , who is the author of the equal report , of course represents austria ' s governing conservative party and its policy .    4.013862132374792
the most UNK aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the geneva convention , that is to say so - called quota refugees or un refugees .    3.717171012399499
in actual fact , it is the other refugees , namely those outside the quota and those not covered by un aid , who need aid the most .    3.5366535739904172
the committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the equal programme on identical conditions .    3.167448401029837
some members of the committee , however , supported mrs stenzel ' s proposal and wordings .    4.946040364013682
as i see it , this means that mr haider ' s politics are already casting their shadow over this parliament .    3.4656037559713826
it is therefore crucially important that the chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the equal programme .    3.800114472218115
i want , finally , to say that i had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the austrian government but , when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees , i have no misgivings .    4.375332595575044
i hope that the chamber will be just as committed this time .    3.243770738808038
mr president , during the last eu financial perspective from 1994 to 1999 , when there were 13 different initiatives in operation , the interreg ii cross - border programme was an important initiative .    3.438015636109742
the fact that the next round of structural funds 2000 - 2006 includes the interreg initiative is i believe , a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national eu member states .    4.232398862630989
the interreg i programme between 1989 and 1993 and the interreg ii programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of UNK closer social and economic development between UNK member states .    3.212900909762816
coming from the border counties in the north - west of ireland , i have seen over the years the important role which interreg i and ii have played and i am delighted to welcome interreg iii .    3.955674405333447
the commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the interreg iii programme , which will be spent on continuing the development of cross - border economic projects between the republic of ireland and northern ireland .    3.7713297621841457
the european union has played a key role in developing the border county region in ireland over the years .    2.9886876558590783
the european union contributes 75 % of the peace and reconciliation programme .    3.8404435170013564
all in all , interreg , the international fund for ireland and the peace and reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process .    3.4115512875530936
mr president , i am taking the floor to speak about interreg , but i shall confine myself to a few criticisms , which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time .    3.6058774482753773
we have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross - border cooperation .    3.733103010789532
however , this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50 - 80 % - will be reserved for cross - border cooperation , for interreg iiia . therefore , we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand , regarding the selection of eligible regions , is wrong and contradictory .    3.910419319060491
we hope that the commission will want to look into this and acknowledge parliament ' s position in practical terms , and not just with a formal tribute .    3.823492092458966
cross - border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and , where exceptions have been made for maritime areas , their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other community policies .    3.385497685729299
this discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature .    3.7061603497362117
this is in line with ongoing discrimination , which ignores article 158 of the treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies .    3.6211160647293132
more serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as malta .    4.720189659170075
this has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the nuts iii sicilian provinces which have a frontier with malta and to include all the regions of the adriatic which share a frontier with balkan regions .    3.1675079701900666
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i should like to express the satisfaction i have in noting that the most remote regions , including the french overseas departments , have received some attention in connection with the interreg iii initiative , opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area , even though it is true that more could have been expected , particularly with regard to access to the various strands .    3.541298878769483
for a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our regions have fixed their attention on the european mainland , ignoring and even UNK their closest neighbours .    3.4086116079040405
that time is now past .    3.6669334517649532
our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to , not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples , hence the UNK expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment .    3.844632202834155
this increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .    3.7177351894328647
it is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets .    3.074652385733435
so , for example , the island of réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern africa and those of south - east asia .    3.470000711015324
it cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area , UNK it miss out on a historic opportunity , and the same applies to our regions in the caribbean .    4.07785710766334
at last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment , the source of so much despair , if we can export to neighbouring countries the know - how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the european structural funds .    4.207948812555272
interreg appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable european union UNK into these geographical areas , giving it worldwide scope .    3.486341340015038
i am counting on the commission , and specifically on you , commissioner , to allocate adequate resources for effective action .    4.142842303193831
mr president , commissioners , i greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans - european cooperation under interreg , but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas .    3.387046616971968
i understand the commission ' s own concern that distance may prove detrimental to effective cooperation .    3.3841001387863217
nonetheless , there are many maritime areas between which links are already established .    3.658939522156028
various local authorities around the north sea provide a prime example of this .    3.0541751383652223
interreg could well allow UNK of such cooperation .    3.283895307218904
in consequence , i seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand a and strand b . these adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects , particularly those of an infrastructural kind .    3.57033258439132
such measures will put maritime and UNK areas on an equal footing with other areas of the eu .    3.4754212382000778
i hope for their adoption .    3.0993328647066596
mr president , our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the equal initiative so that , if you are a british UNK physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems , rather than being defined as the problem .    3.4696684101444686
there is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared .    3.0157939729624044
we also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level .    3.34491834116812
we are concerned , therefore , as others have said , at the number of amendments which seek to exclude even further some of society ' s most excluded , by aiming for a very narrow definition of " refugee " .    3.96230438414421
my group will not be supporting those amendments .    3.4364662189687394
we are also concerned at the number of amendments which , in seeking to introduce greater flexibility , run the risk perhaps of UNK responsibility for the management of the equal initiative .    3.8924520097792406
mr president , i am very pleased to see urban orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems .    2.7883587544631943
yet , there is some risk of dilution of effort . if we pursue too many objectives , our overall effectiveness suffers .    3.4069160224597628
but there is a common factor , a hard core , comprising unemployment , the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium - sized enterprises , both commercial and other kinds .    3.119565471055278
i would wish urban to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation .    2.7892038422947154
for this , of course , central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy , so that the latter too can be UNK and can work UNK with the objectives of any urban programmes implemented in our countries , and so that it is not just using them as an UNK for its own shortcomings .    5.174641143413986
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i shall confine my observations to mr decourrière ' s report .    2.374271969477523
the interreg community initiative programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of european territory , most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the european union and its outlying regions .    3.9908345575805995
interreg must , therefore , be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the union if we do not wish to see a two - or even three - speed european territory .    3.864597463688796
it is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities , and their representative bodies , the committee of the regions and , of course , the european parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme .    4.433244204583405
indeed , i am forced to observe that this was not the case when the commission drew up its communication , published on 13 october last year .    4.115438645198975
even though i approve of the general guidelines of interreg iii , i feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme , financed by the erdf , and the other external cooperation funds , including in particular the european development fund , intended for acp countries .    4.181059240235611
in this connection , i should like to thank the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the edf to the list of these funds .    2.836261219335705
the most remote regions , particularly the four french overseas departments , must be able to coordinate interreg iii and the edf in order to fund , in turn , cooperation projects with their acp neighbours in their respective geographical areas .    4.108441518106944
furthermore , i would ask the commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication .    4.04757858629632
it is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from interreg iii , just like all the other regions in the union , especially now that the UNK programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped .    4.409639006587003
finally , in conclusion , i would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand c , for interregional cooperation , even though the added value this offers the community is undeniable .    3.233779840476612
mr president , my starting point is the equal report and equality between men and women , although i must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue , which has a feeling of UNK UNK about it when you are my age , in any case .    4.152111266945911
unfortunately , it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality .    4.744394431485931
a breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas , however .    3.999863171211197
for me , equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a UNK work the whole time and hand the children over to a UNK , UNK an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job .    3.9647822087910023
if that is the case , we have not progressed one little bit since UNK times .    3.7833209681105706
no , equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life .    3.6033740608586777
unfortunately , developments are not moving in that direction .    3.1756696280055787
on the contrary .    2.9262503695866204
i think , therefore , that paragraph 7 contains something very central , i . e . that equal will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies .    3.169854575232639
one can only hope that it succeeds .    3.9004503911199633
i should just like to say , in accordance with the rules of procedure , that if i am not here when the commission responds - not that i have asked any specific questions , but i should nonetheless hope that the commission has been paying attention - then that is because the committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities is meeting to discuss women in the decision - making process at the same time as the present debate is going on .    3.8494468431697495
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , those who work on rural areas know that , of the programmes which the european union has managed , the leader programme , both leader i and leader ii , is one of its success stories , and i hope that the same will be true of leader + .    4.128653938297157
one of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the leader programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned .    3.6898088246811547
i am glad that leader + is to remain true to this underlying concept .    2.9097701034396732
there is a problem , however , which we need to address together .    5.247098613788761
because leader is a kind of UNK with a bottom - up approach , a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through leader i and ii which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were .    3.6298223436925103
and because of the programme ' s success and its basic approach they will of course at some point then be dropped from leader .    3.833304915208081
that is why , where the good leader projects are concerned , we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued ; instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable , positive component of our support to rural areas .    3.4887278109279904
of course this is also the basic idea .    4.0646645767157406
it is to take new ideas and try them out in leader , with the participants on the ground , with the local organisations on the ground , with many non - governmental organisations , with the churches , with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities .    3.9922927924832448
here we must ensure that the good schemes , those which are really excellent , are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work .    4.07769012526515
my request to the commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted .    5.026431196164349
there should be no attempt to have one or other organisation , which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known , pushed a little on to the sidelines , say because of official local or regional policy .    3.7658727249808788
have faith in the successful results which leader has had so far .    3.377941418994458
and then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy , including ourselves at this level , could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well .    3.098815591478144
that was the UNK of leader , and that should please not be lost !    5.069682990571235
mr president , i welcome the equal initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups .    3.4391704406797268
women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender .    3.675115877037478
this is why specific action for women is needed , as well as mainstreaming .    3.8403322369483264
the report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work ; it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed .    3.5825131680571536
the involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the equal initiative and the projects .    3.754000635411321
the development partnerships within the thematic fields , which are referred to in amendment no . 22 , would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the equal initiative .    3.643873636242919
my group will be supporting amendment no . 22 .    3.193126221581455
mr president , the report under discussion in the house today is doubtless of great importance .    3.3403228986171865
in addition to the objectives it is working towards , the strong point of the community initiative interreg for the 2000 - 2006 programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the european union to include new eastern european and mediterranean countries .    3.7871788566268125
indeed , these areas - and it is right to stress this - have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the union .    3.895107224184899
it is precisely with this in mind that i tabled some amendments which i consider to be of the utmost importance , and that the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism has subsequently taken up .    3.4500805832460864
they call for the areas eligible for cross - border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the adriatic , as well as to the sicilian provinces which have a frontier with malta - an applicant country - which , UNK , are not currently included in strand a , annex 1 .    3.863146571429765
i am confident that commissioner barnier and the president of the european commission will duly consider parliament ' s position on the matter , in accordance with the code of conduct .    4.204989060363381
there are fundamental advantages for the whole of europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions .    4.407625712184655
finally , it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the interreg initiative and the existing community programmes , which are significant for external policy , as a UNK for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes .    4.609995380852716
mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , leader i was an UNK success due , in particular , to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the commission and the local operators .    3.9130137211864158
it is , i think , regrettable that the commission could not make a similar assessment of leader ii , regarding the quality of the projects , the quantity of appropriations spent and , most especially , the UNK of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered .    3.9786986500633015
i am pleased to see , however , that under leader + , new resources have been allocated to helping rural territories to develop their potential and to implement the objectives of local and sustainable development .    3.751052259322866
i feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment , in order to promote employment .    3.6579029765639404
it is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for leader ii .    3.184646266315281
nonetheless , if the opportunity for member states to determine the areas , within the scope of this initiative , remains available , then the commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas .    4.723700387559714
there must , of course , be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups .    3.4249550720792645
i also feel there are grounds for ensuring , in particular , that the financial channels of states or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some lags to become UNK under leader ii .    3.5396542267852555
mr president , as a member from one of the outermost regions , i must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned , because of the debate on two community initiatives , urban and interreg .    4.889803481985132
i would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed , firstly , in the case of urban , at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various european cities , and , in the case of interreg , at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the european union , particularly by including the outermost regions in strands b and c .    3.857783325650415
like the rapporteur , we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand iiia .    3.388065982728143
with regard to interreg , we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a european monitoring centre concerned with cooperation .    4.24353375760082
i would like to thank the rapporteurs , particularly mr decourrière , for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments .    3.095868257424496
i hope that the commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making .    3.952746421664413
it is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the european parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained .    3.7763890327643503
the commission proposed removing it and other initiatives , but parliament ' s proposal and the sensitivity of the commission itself at the time led to the urban initiative being retained .    4.640596577288576
i believe that we should be pleased about this .    2.7458296185780138
but what were the commission ' s arguments , from commissioner monika wulf - mathies and director - general UNK UNK in particular , for eliminating the urban programme ?    3.9084835386076184
its argument was one of priority .    3.6541270404444117
the urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our UNK and UNK it with a programme which has such a small budget .    4.469826668107146
today the programme is in place and therefore i believe we have achieved something important , that distinguishing mark of the european union called the urban programme .    4.484051485247706
however , i would like to address commissioner barnier and support the argument of commissioner wulf - mathies and the director - general , because i think they were absolutely right .    3.3202330643133537
the urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .    3.55961517932718
the amount of budget required by our cities - where 80 % of the european population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in europe , i believe , clearly indicates that the european dimension should be taken into account and that this urban programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail , not to prioritise and , therefore , not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities , by means of european funds .    4.429221036319691
therefore , i do not believe i need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas , factors which are on the agenda , and i would like to say to the commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect .    3.9309211575060465
organisations of disabled people and disabled people ' s non - disabled representatives must have a proper interest at every stage of decision - making .    3.5968035702983787
that is why this parliament has put forward paragraphs 10 and 15 of the resolution , to ensure that member states cannot ignore any one target group .    3.7247921392788412
disabled people have too often been left off the list .    3.6018758247540896
because disabled people do not form one homogenous group - for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture - it is necessary as stated in paragraph 9 to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group .    3.415115780024586
equal remains crucial also to regions like my own , in the east of england , outside the principal funds of objective i . we have had an extra incentive to take up community initiative funding and an excellent record in response .    4.071302671834122
former adapt projects range from the core project , which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in UNK , to projects to raise standards in small businesses in UNK in essex .    4.220215453169262
we have seen the now project helping 70 women to return to work in suffolk , many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the european parliament in brussels .    3.963046041914946
equal remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower - skilled jobs are being shed , which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market .    3.451215901528557
finally , a word on interreg .    2.787661323502012
it really is quite UNK that partnerships set up in 1994 are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter - regional links .    3.6430164270176597
during this period the ports of great UNK and UNK on the essex - suffolk - UNK coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the netherlands .    3.505772329021737
i urge parliament to support our amendment no 2 , which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas , particularly on maritime borders .    4.116997309617261
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the information of the house , mr president , i should like to make a clarification .    3.287350237645524
there is no change in refugee policy in austria !    3.2459936432675813
rural areas make up over 80 % of the eu ' s territory and 25 % of the population live in them .    3.8813866638149412
as a farmer and member of parliament , i have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole .    3.6569496538031356
i attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because i am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone ; i refer , in short , to the multifunctionality of rural areas .    3.491332990113345
i should like to welcome in particular the new leader + programme because of its comprehensive nature .    3.41494511327671
in the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the eu .    3.894919195175699
this across - the - board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .    3.630709536765432
in the future , funding will no longer come from three funds but from the eaggf guidance section alone .    3.2852158757170105
it will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the eaggf is supposed to be an effective financial instrument .    4.372666675744239
greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness , because the money should not be UNK UNK .    4.124168277926374
in addition , i should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy .    3.396011352878409
there is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside .    3.8882884917607394
that is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers .    3.532935680507264
leader + should supplement already existing programmes , avoid UNK and duplication of financing and thus contribute to a process of development which is as comprehensive as possible .    3.2742980257404466
in this way , leader + can , together with the programmes under regulation ( ec ) no UNK / 99 , consolidate the second pillar of the cap even more effectively and produce the best possible benefits for the whole of the countryside .    3.551953839040731
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am not always proud of the UNK that goes on here in parliament , but the urban programme is one of the best examples of our work : it was created following an initiative in parliament .    3.9694289491740458
the commission would have abolished urban , but this time parliament drew the longer straw .    3.104609367167372
it is good that urban is to continue , as it has had good results at local level .    3.561656823574434
the problems in europe ' s urban areas are getting worse ; fortunately , we now have consensus with the commission .    3.840312617449783
the majority of the population of europe live in cities , and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves .    3.6059030528626654
there is an immense risk of exclusion .    3.008319190256133
in many cities in france and england there are now UNK , breeding grounds for many sorts of problems .    3.390788019699618
none of us wants south american type UNK in europe .    2.9768111175643854
we have to act now , before it is too late .    3.130020815633788
our cities are also of decisive importance for europe ' s economy .    4.0166529326661955
we always come back to the same basic problem in europe : our economy does not support the individual sufficiently , nor is it sufficiently dynamic .    3.9576758202625704
the economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow - citizens and our environment .    4.349088970298856
this is not policy ; it is life ' s simple logic .    3.2540911965133783
it is good that spending has become focused , as otherwise the UNK gets scattered to the four winds .    2.8715995823970073
now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle - size towns and cities , as they do not have enough resources .    3.873846410745385
in this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas ; it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand .    3.6391289076954885
the basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship , as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally .    3.7562671990623424
granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well : there will be enough to drink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be dry again .    3.4514212696012168
mr president , with the implementation of interreg iii , european cooperation policy is entering a new phase .    3.670861290813653
our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones .    3.8309020782108547
in the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation , the european union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions , particularly in eastern and southern europe .    3.7175164292295313
the union ' s borders must no longer be an obstacle to balanced development , but - on the contrary - an opportunity , a bridge to more fruitful cooperation .    3.8305841216679806
by means of amendments adopted in committee , parliament has tried to supplement the commission ' s work , by including new elements in the list of areas targeted for aid , and in particular external border areas and maritime border areas in southern europe .    4.017646879504889
in its draft guidelines , the commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past .    3.786663829587323
this is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the mediterranean countries .    4.220973969686648
as president prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period 2000 - 2005 , boosting the barcelona process is a priority for the union , and the interreg iii initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective .    4.124123573634546
in congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work , we can but hope that the commission will duly take into consideration the proposals parliament has put forward , in accordance with the commitments made under the code of conduct on the implementation of structural policies , and that it will confirm , with fitting amendments , the transformation of this community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries .    3.998107149448764
mr president , from this year until the year 2006 around eur 200 billion is available for the structural funds , but only UNK % is set aside for the community initiatives , interreg , leader , urban and equal .    3.6828935965522938
that is a reduction of UNK % compared with the previous UNK .    3.521906345844135
no more than eur 2 . 8 billion is provided for equal , as mrs stenzel ' s balanced report makes clear .    3.6402712812897984
this makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing .    4.032189452292552
how are priorities supposed to be set here ?    3.9115053269864775
there is agreement on the principle that marginalisation , discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced .    4.0078851910882864
transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .    4.0807831909523005
i have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the taos . criticism of the previous commission ' s work was particularly severe , legitimately so , with regard to these technical assistance offices .    3.4986949392837414
our committee on employment and social affairs was , after all , in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to leonardo .    3.0874394910208203
the commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under equal either .    3.360543017232769
it can only approve member states ' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria : firstly , integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships , whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account ; secondly , the systematic involvement of the operators concerned - the local , regional and national authorities , training institutions , universities , ngos , the two sides of industry and the private sector - with the aim of creating a durable partnership , and thirdly , methods and models of UNK innovative character .    3.5228850281778668
the commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work , of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices .    4.026887316381474
only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved .    2.972782341606439
mr president , i want to refer to the commission proposals on the budget line to promote the cap .    4.155762771986545
on 26 october 1999 the european commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the cap .    4.379592650578163
this proposal will remove the current budget line UNK - UNK and create a new budget heading b1 - UNK .    3.7387454295404194
actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the eu and also create stronger links with eu candidate countries and the outside world are important .    3.79447975743671
therefore i am putting forward these amendments to parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme .    3.881564428431834
informing and training young farmers at european level is vitally important .    3.7034536385556143
i would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst european young farmers .    3.4034596026259147
regarding information and training , in the past this budget line has been allocated for information , communication and training .    4.490903027439816
but the commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included .    3.856523502011487
i feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at european level about the cap .    3.40579460293743
such european training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the cap to make sound business decisions for the future .    3.4207612600651207
therefore i am putting forward three amendments .    2.6629964527272674
i would urge parliament to support them .    2.877968943490296
mr president , i am taking the floor to express my opinion , drawn from my experience of municipal administration , that the urban projects should , or rather must , have a threefold purpose : firstly , to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic , old and perhaps UNK areas of cities .    3.8693651373355373
secondly , to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres , within these old quarters of our cities .    3.3133702083198457
i would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators , but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment , or to put it another way , projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs .    3.4836543246828033
thirdly - and perhaps this should be the first objective - the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families , because man is not made for the law , but rather law is made for man .    4.1633891886866
these areas of our cities are often home to single - UNK families , elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity , and families facing difficulties ; sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society .    3.116151247537898
these people live in areas which should benefit from these projects .    3.527617155882069
if we have success in this threefold sense , i believe that these families , these people , these european citizens , will believe more in europe , and this seems to me to be very important because , ultimately , the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in european life .    4.029258474909425
. ( fr ) mr president , before my friends and fellow commissioners , franz fischler and UNK diamantopoulou , in turn come to speak - since all three of us who are responsible for these four community initiatives have had the opportunity to follow this debate with the same interest , i would like to endeavour to speak on the subject of urban and interreg , which many of you have brought up and discussed .    3.8999557424431694
straight away i should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees , from all the committees , but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives .    4.28692657526611
this is particularly true of what mrs mccarthy said about urban . i should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also - and i do not see why i in turn should not say so too - for all we owe her , for all you owe her as far as this is initiative , as well as , more generally , all we owe parliament .    4.093188396844467
i am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the european parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties , in favour of sustainable urban development , involving at the same time this integrated approach , which we value , to handle the economic , social and environmental aspects simultaneously .    4.323078230503097
some other points of agreement highlighted in mrs mccarthy ' s report , the effectiveness of this instrument through the concentration of funding and a critical mass for intervention , the horizontal operation which we think more conducive to disseminating results and increasing the exchange of experience and good practice and , finally , the increasing role of local authorities in the planning and management of the programmes , on the basis of a real partnership .    3.8860724477891884
having mentioned the fundamental points of agreement between the commission ' s proposals and parliament and , having stressed my great interest in hearing the various contributions , i should like to answer a few of the criticisms and a few of the suggestions which have been made , with apologies if i cannot attribute each of the questions to the speakers by name .    4.284610694325847
i think however that you will all recognise your own comments .    3.4543600103843386
i can understand your concern .    2.91745265634739
i have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the urban programme conditional upon certain guarantees , firstly on concentration - i am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of 20 000 or , in exceptional cases , 10 000 inhabitants - and also upon the critical mass of funding : we must keep to eur 500 per inhabitant so that the european union action may be both effective and clear , and so that it does not resemble a sort of UNK of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities .    3.8738455636439486
that is my initial response to the threshold question .    3.1758901470704206
regarding a second matter , now , relating to the additional criteria , which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas . here , too , i am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the community criteria given in point 11 of the guidance project .    4.041598200364502
this concern , ladies and gentlemen , lies at the very heart of our urban initiative , and i am willing to UNK the text , if necessary , in order to make this message clearer yet .    4.8262713605645
regarding urban , i should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention , first of all , the selection procedure .    3.593431667014376
some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding .    4.712177202067013
ladies and gentlemen , on this point we must make it clear : in the context of subsidiarity , the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for urban is primarily the responsibility of the member states .    3.884763367694905
as far as the commission is concerned , it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload , but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes , indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did .    4.416907550814015
a second observation , the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes .    3.5810286936446416
i have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme .    2.848588365435909
this cannot , however , be grounds for an extension of the original time limit .    4.059472408815703
let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months .    3.1330284949503784
this time limit , which indeed is identical to the one we granted for interreg and for the objective 2 docups , should normally be adequate , i feel , for drawing up a programme , which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage .    3.8129627063395266
with regard to urban , i should like to conclude with a final observation .    3.23327189136296
one of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the urban initiative .    3.479535466842733
i agree completely .    3.2876695454276996
i myself expressed my concern at the meeting of ministers for regional and urban planning , a concern to which i devote myself , that in the docups and the csfs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate , my concern , as i said , that , apart from the urban initiative , urban issues should be addressed in all the objective 1 and objective 2 programmes , and i believe i can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them , beyond the scope of urban , in all structural fund programming .    4.319226046756312
but , as for the future , since we must look ahead , i am extremely concerned to see how urban is going to be implemented in practical terms , and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn , because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspectives , a new european regional planning policy .    4.750292692395443
i am not forgetting , and we cannot forget , that 80 % of the citizens of europe today live in towns and that is why this urban instrument is extremely important .    4.0483125406291265
let me repeat what i have said , we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming .    3.6014401066721984
i should now , mr president , like to bring up the subject of interreg and to thank the rapporteur , francis decourrière , in the same way that i UNK arlene mccarthy , for the quality and relevance of his work .    4.734480779594952
he stressed a number of points , with which we may indicate our agreement , as many of you did too - the importance of this trans - european cooperation , with its three strands , cross - border , transnational , interregional ; the added value to the community provided by interreg , its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds , and the truly cross - border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations ; the importance of common structures and what , in discussing another debate which begins today , the intergovernmental conference , i termed the common european spirit which we have to strengthen , and here , with interreg , thanks to interreg , is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity ; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners .    4.215790345408771
having made these general observations , i should like to focus on your main comments with regard to interreg .    3.818887576927292
the first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative .    3.5499342021215865
you comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date , stressing , particularly your rapporteur , the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted .    3.6522787032947917
it is true , i admit it , and you are well aware of the reasons , ladies and gentlemen .    3.971327119095755
there is a delay in adopting the interreg guidelines in march or april 2000 .    3.0397331625024218
i accept this ; i take note of it as you do .    3.8055666482054322
i note , however , that the member states and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for interreg iii and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now .    3.752715857892798
i also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and i can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to 1 january , if the programme is presented before 30 april .    3.7142040917115344
so much for the first comment .    4.006843014142921
as to the second comment : regarding the non - comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand b , i wish to inform you , to confirm , that i have asked the commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects , particularly in favour of small - and medium - sized businesses and of cultural heritage , in the list of schemes eligible under strand b and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one .    4.2147674238427255
as your rapporteur has requested , i shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand .    4.345517277473499
as you requested , i have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the commission on the service UNK systems .    4.669441119722693
but , ladies and gentlemen , if we do remove every reference and any recourse to a UNK at a later date then this will have a consequence and that will be an increase in the number of officials ' jobs needed to do this work , because somebody will have to do it and i cannot keep UNK the same staff indefinitely , at a time when our duties are increasing with the pre - accession structural instrument ( ispa ) and in order to ensure that , the community appropriations for which i am responsible , often in partnership or on terms of UNK with member states , are monitored better , with discipline and transparency .    3.9979903947414677
now to the implementation of interreg , a subject mentioned by many of you , and the potential eligibility under strand a , ' cross - border cooperation ' , of schemes in the adriatic , on behalf of sicily or for the most remote regions , the commission , ladies and gentlemen , understands your concerns and takes note of your requests on these various points .    4.350655905093414
i therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand b : ' integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions ' , so as to cover , in what i think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions .    3.626306804804866
i have decided , in the end , that the most remote regions , to which i attach particular importance , will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of interreg , with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other member state regions .    4.391779608406054
i also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between interreg and the edf , particularly for the caribbean and the indian ocean .    3.417431915257971
i adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the union are actually active frontiers of the union , even if , or precisely because , they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear .    4.3480836871769615
another point : the coordination between interreg , phare , tacis and meda .    2.7912579901860393
it is true , once again , and i accept this objectively , that there are still real legal problems .    4.3979410964862895
i do not want to minimise these , but progress is being made as far as strand a cooperation with candidate countries is concerned , even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain .    4.130467437558158
the commission must continue along these lines .    3.075516397819586
i am making a personal commitment to do so .    3.1115609896170273
an initial joint phare / cip committee is to meet in february to assess this coordination , and let me confirm my UNK and availability with regard to this , together with my colleagues and fellow commissioners verheugen , patten and poul nielson .    3.575157337720251
finally , on the subject of technical assistance , on which your rapporteur and several of you commented . it goes without saying that the commission will adhere to the terms of article 23 of the general regulations regarding technical assistance , if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general .    4.187636337476691
according to the general regulations , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a community initiative must be proposed under article 20 , and not article 23 .    4.179024849841614
this means that the ceiling of 0 . 25 % mentioned in article 23 does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance .    3.5904780283518734
i attach great importance , ladies and gentlemen , in a spirit of discipline and transparency , to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information , and not to propaganda , and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the union .    3.8717028334175287
my conclusion regarding interreg , mr president , ladies and gentlemen , is that these community initiatives for which i am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this . they also UNK a real european regional planning policy within our enlarged union .    4.064663368059448
the commission attaches the greatest importance to this , just as you yourselves do .    3.937246694524045
i remain at your service in order , when the time comes , to present the report of previous planning which you request , but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning .    4.621470718006251
repeating my thanks to each and every one of you , and also particularly to arlene mccarthy and francis decourrière , i should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar : only eur 700 million for urban , but this is better than nothing ; eur 4 billion 800 millions for interreg .    3.4406366125969035
so we are working within this framework and not outside it .    3.1765022118206816
on the subject of these two initiatives , then , with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives , let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the european parliament and its committees .    4.030720630771739
everything that i have just said , ladies and gentlemen , demonstrates that the commission is resolved to taken the views of parliament into account .    4.329657583327159
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , i should like firstly to thank mr procacci for his report .    2.9422883598469607
however , i should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the leader + initiative .    4.479129128865981
i am also pleased that parliament essentially supports the commission ' s view that leader + should be applied in all rural areas , that overriding priorities should be introduced and that , above all , active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged .    3.4274956974708295
in addition , i note that parliament shares the commission ' s view that the preferred form for implementing leader + is the use of global grants .    3.3304677415211428
turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today , i can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in leader + .    4.64845034234022
the various groups , be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment , have the possibility of taking part in drafting the commission directives .    3.7953041863898798
and there will not be less funds available than in the current period either ; there will be more .    4.743577559118035
i should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new .    3.2515118909752676
there was also an observatory under leader i and leader ii .    2.7355720184634356
it has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual leader groups .    3.483798000240384
the cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2 % of the leader budget .    3.652667752709475
as far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned , i might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy , which means , in our view , that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of leader .    5.418229060728842
i now come to the content of the report .    3.0958910343532424
i should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because , as you know , it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for leader ii funds to be disbursed .    3.9294354582922755
we therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme ' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation .    3.6866834338077497
we will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it .    3.7642020837014214
in point 18 , parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives .    2.8530786303103928
in response i can only say that this already exists .    3.5806293110363265
it has already been compiled by the commission and i can make a copy available to any member of this house who is interested .    4.244759674567507
in point 21 , parliament stresses that the guidelines in leader + now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start .    4.282475362278197
i can only fully share your concern .    2.9499369474847987
as soon as the opinion is adopted here in parliament , the guidelines for leader + will again be presented to the star committee so that the member states can confirm the provisional agreement which they gave on 14 november .    4.613166723402589
i assume that the commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in march or april .    4.135675415605751
and as soon as these are published in the official journal the remaining months - in fact six months - can be used to submit leader + programmes .    3.6966649810091865
for all programmes submitted before 30 april of this year it will be possible to UNK the beginning of the period of eligibility to 1 january .    4.136014342253032
finally , under point 20 the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines .    3.442742915678383
having given them thorough consideration , i can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 are acceptable to the commission and are adopted .    3.926316558824497
the proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under leader + is a maximum of 5 months .    3.5081921109922036
the amendment proposed under paragraph 1 has , in our view , been overtaken by events because , following consultations with the representatives of the member states in the star committee , this point has already been UNK along the lines proposed by parliament .    3.610477581925899
that therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 .    3.1456965757367867
the commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the commission itself had originally proposed .    3.4794046441175857
i must add , however , that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the member states .    3.5009059043500783
an amendment was therefore made in the committee , but the commission will now again take account of parliament ' s concern in the revised version and table the guidelines in that form .    4.645810363240784
it will also continue to fight for member states ' acceptance of this .    4.048652896052078
i will comment briefly on the 13 amendments tabled .    3.015115109745001
here there are only three which the commission cannot accept , amendments nos 3 , 12 and 13 .    3.538347033865571
it can accept all of the others either in full or in essence .    3.724808308194879
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the equal initiative in the european parliament just at this time .    4.064693070909384
recently , because of political developments in austria , there is growing unease within europe . political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue .    4.576183463206291
it is worth stressing that both parliament and the commission must put forward specific policies .    3.6058406000758914
we need specific proposals , both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies .    3.841324577691776
so i will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti - discrimination package as soon as possible .    3.2129799581716747
i now come to the equal initiative , which is , of course , based on article 13 .    4.309978570884949
the equal initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of article 13 , namely the fight against discrimination based on race , gender , age , and special needs .    3.546653647998576
i would particularly like to congratulate mrs stenzel , because her effort to reach agreement on the equal initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex , both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue .    4.130018165740519
the first comment , which has been made by many others too , is whether women should be mentioned separately .    3.988409767165449
i agree that article 13 contains something we have expressed our disagreement about , but that is how the treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination , discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place .    3.2633354998255393
so on the basis of the treaty as it stands today , the equal initiative is structured in that way .    5.3581858371588345
i would like to remind you , however , that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared , the fifth programme for equality between men and women .    3.1919441443285597
i have classified the issues raised by the honourable members into four groups .    3.124711197130463
firstly , the enlargement of the thematic areas .    3.3285824829159174
as in employment strategy , there are four thematic areas : employability , entrepreneurship , adaptability and equal opportunities , and we agree that those thematic areas should be enlarged in line with the european parliament ' s proposals .    3.7118702304950735
to answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination , i will say that the initiative states clearly that the member states must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination .    4.351061117813972
the second subject is flexibility and simplification .    3.118943425891902
i agree with mr leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand .    3.511005498154741
that is why the services are already trying to revise the text , simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp .    3.1528245479270764
as regards the subject of flexibility , we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace , and at the thematic level where , for example , cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector .    3.713187123304757
this would allow member states great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs .    3.209715318928877
of course , a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the member states , and a network which will assist the exchange of experience .    3.8050081054214373
finally , i would like to mention technical assistance .    2.92306045207254
we are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available .    3.2779141938526974
first , funding for preparation ; second , implementation ; third , mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience , and fourth , technical assistance .    3.1830899386415243
since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided , we must say that external offices will be used .    4.769035754260512
as mr barnier too pointed out , it is impossible for all the work previously done by external UNK to be done now by the commission ' s staff .    4.775975339859524
the aim at national and european level is to establish large action groups by tender , with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested . we would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised .    4.004450160513559
i want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible , both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned , in other words , we must be absolutely ready by the end of 2000 .    4.02437234773189
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
i shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the bureau and to the appropriate committees .    3.5649392045619255
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon .    2.1712963064378976
( the sitting was closed at 8 . 40 p . m . )    1.8733108228357767
approval of the minutes of the two previous sittings    4.170614490321175
the minutes of the sittings of thursday 3 february and monday 14 february have been distributed .    2.468211512155136
the minutes of 3 february were originally distributed in brussels so perhaps this is why some members did not receive them .    3.50750006538127
are there any comments ?    2.070454319710833
( the minutes were approved )    1.9577163372853157
madam president , my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part - session on monday UNK at 5 . 00 p . m .    2.995633358686424
yesterday it was impossible for myself and many meps to be here , because the 2 . 15 p . m . air france flight , which normally brings us here , was cancelled , with no explanation from the airline , and we therefore arrived very late .    3.7302993791967967
if air france insists on boycotting the european parliament , we should take measures to prevent this occurring again .    4.346945045020769
thank you , mr medina ortega .    2.9345015602280737
i too wholeheartedly regret this situation .    3.0920896271305676
would you be so kind as to write to me so that i have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both air france and the french government ?    3.6081863960297214
this situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly .    3.861470462074321
madam president , i had the same experience as mr medina ortega yesterday .    3.125707898355092
i feel that the french authorities - which have the honour of housing the european parliament in strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the union .    3.9762129386477856
madam president , off the subject of aeroplane delays , i wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the group of the greens / european free alliance , UNK lucas , who is a british member .    3.188555520088076
she could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti - nuclear demonstration in glasgow .    3.2718185948644614
although her identity was noted and her position as a member of the european parliament was very apparent , she was still held in custody all day .    3.4119460455848145
i regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the british authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that mrs lucas receives an apology . i have written to you in this respect together with my colleague , mrs hautala .    3.8901813379293575
thank you , mr lannoye .    2.942057963269788
i have received your letter and have already contacted the british permanent representative .    2.654161670746887
i should like the vote on the community equal initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point .    3.5676470567377967
i am optimistic and quite UNK and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on equal .    3.1995277512199505
we just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and i would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .    3.5561134388617255
madam president , to follow on from the point that mr lannoye made : mrs lucas was arrested just outside glasgow for protesting against the UNK base at faslane .    3.253359681136786
i have a lot of sympathy with that protest .    3.507933606071561
i have , however , no sympathy for mrs lucas trying to hide behind her parliamentary immunity .    3.215669585308027
i have also been arrested for protesting at faslane .    2.79920174600555
i did not hide behind any immunity .    3.2263726872289653
i took the punishment that came to me .    3.5414993242462063
mrs lucas should do the same .    3.215765735136379
madam president , i would like to comment on the request mrs stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the community initiative equal until tomorrow .    2.881353272487643
we agree with mrs stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups , so that parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible .    3.9572963050802814
does anyone want to speak against mrs stenzel ' s request , as supported by mrs UNK ?    3.670551970328313
if not , then we will proceed to the vote .    2.754931392221691
( parliament approved the request )    2.9953481995175015
madam president , under rule 29 ( 4 ) you should be kept informed by political groups of any members who have joined a new political group or who have left a political group .    3.2436638258780035
have you received any notification of any members leaving the group of the european people ' s party or does the austrian people ' s party continue to sit in that political group ?    3.102521792347448
madam president , i am UNK at mr corbett ' s reaction .    3.0221820538013198
he should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here .    2.8362700552935762
we are solidly with our austrian friends who have proven to be good europeans in the past .    2.9166866986842406
they have our full support .    2.6613218287457
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
agenda    3.515252916915767
( parliament gave its assent )    2.0659013727593916
commission ' s strategic objectives and legislative programme    4.722825663076537
the next item is the joint debate on the commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 2000 .    3.088385087645214
i therefore immediately give the floor to the president of the commission , mr prodi .    3.485157587813715
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , a five - year programme is an extremely important undertaking , and this is why i preferred that you be given the UNK text of the speech , which is available in four languages .    3.8617191052565714
to respect my speaking time , i will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme : a programme for the UNK of a new legislature and a new century , when it is right and proper to see europe in a broader perspective , a europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation .    4.216502377681736
let us remember that for half a century , europe has provided us with peace , security and freedom and a united europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity .    3.557472776924383
we are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery , which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies .    3.6277873557434828
this recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made , but it comes at a price : it follows the restructuring of public accounts in european countries , which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries , banks and public services , even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go .    3.882540824392546
nevertheless , despite these aspects , european citizens are disappointed and concerned : by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough ; by a europe trailing behind in technology , and UNK falling even further behind , and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too ; by the european institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times , starting with the commission itself .    3.717603415101602
the crisis in the commission was , in fact , a crucial point in the relationship between europe and its citizens , and the low turnout at the european elections was a worrying indication of this .    4.67033624574233
even stronger still , however , is the sense of insecurity , the feeling of being UNK in a new world that is moving forwards , a world which is completely changing , where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference .    3.775883399229061
this is not the first time this has happened : europe was once confronted with a similar transformation , an explosion of its markets , a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world .    3.2828834716394732
i am referring to the UNK century when the discovery of america turned everything upside down .    2.828185699317125
some countries - such as france and spain - managed to meet the challenge , giving rise to great nation states ; other countries - such as italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium : headway in science , technology , economic progress , defence structures and military organisation , philosophy and literature .    3.1951622902465253
today , europe is facing a similar challenge , and we know that , just as history has been UNK in the past , it will not be UNK in the present .    5.677114428371325
in this context of wholesale change , and in order to prevent our nation states UNK again , in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges , europe needs to be economically strong , because globalisation demands unity , because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at european level too .    3.578983182581709
but more vital still is a europe that feels strong in the political arena .    3.426873489892803
in years past , the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions , the UNK of european life .    4.197252786696333
today , the new frontiers of european integration are political frontiers : common foreign and security policy , justice and internal security , and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based .    3.846132396132753
the commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000 - 2005 , a programme that was immediately sent to the european parliament and with which you are already familiar , so i will not go into detail about it now .    3.8459997110715283
some of you may find it lacks detail , but no political structure sets out detailed five - year programmes .    3.4632758344729693
our programme highlights the major points of reference , the major areas for action : firstly , the development of new forms of governance for europe ; secondly , extension and enlargement of the area of peace , freedom , and security ; thirdly , the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy ; fourthly , safeguarding and improving quality of life .    4.111076065118315
these will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years .    2.840887179940463
with regard to the first area - new forms of governance for europe - you already know that the commission has undertaken to produce a white paper and not a full legislative text since , in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact , the commission is first of all preparing for a debate ; we will subsequently discuss the content with you ; this will give rise to a policy document , and finally , a legislative document .    4.205040043995252
this is an effective , transparent way to proceed and involve all the european institutions and the citizens of europe .    3.4581438354854166
this white paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us , an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions , rethink our very policies - all our policies - and above all rethink what we must continue to do at union level when the member states number 25 or 30 , and what will be the best thing to do at individual state level , at regional level and at local government level .    4.144377247043309
but it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink : as i said a few moments ago , it is also economic and political globalisation itself .    3.927345649765043
we must govern europe in such a way as to make us more efficient , to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved , starting with the important issue of the involvement of women .    3.570627261694488
one of the main differences in the comparison made recently between europe and the united states was not so much job mobility or risk capital , as women ' s involvement in economic life , an issue that has much more prominence in the united states than in europe . this is a field where europe has , nevertheless , always been in the vanguard .    4.262064077876576
we therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind , and all the institutions - commission , parliament , council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies .    4.012813592449134
we shall therefore get straight back to work on this white paper , although in order to finish it , we shall have to wait for the results of the intergovernmental conference , and it will therefore not be ready until spring 2001 .    4.294017923735038
it will not be a philosophical paper , but a practical paper , full of focused proposals .    3.4884479759574765
we - the commission - are the first to know that we must have a total rethink , and we shall therefore do two things : we are , and will continue to be , fully committed to internal reform , and we shall rethink our policies in detail .    5.331993898655336
i have asked all the commissioners - and i shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way - to pinpoint all the activities that we can UNK .    4.062523154559504
the commission must define what its fundamental activities are , what it must concentrate on and shed its non - essential activities , thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co - operative relationship with individual countries , regions and local communities .    2.840076972875249
so we shall be freeing up new resources , but - i fear , and i want to state this before parliament - the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will , in turn , be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks : i am thinking of enlargement , the new sector of justice and home affairs , health issues and environmental matters .    4.391492175251724
when that time comes , when we have used up all our resources , i shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources , but what i am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources , we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on .    4.508283316328046
as for internal reform , you well know how committed my commission has been to this since day one .    3.5505678670228034
providing aid rapidly , when it is needed , saves human lives ; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all .    3.6821261401064826
when i speak about external aid , my thoughts immediately turn to the balkans . there is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground , an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems .    3.498896759153519
my thoughts also turn to bernard kouchner ' s efforts , of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication , but i also think of new events , such as croatia , where the situation has changed in a few weeks : the european institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only bosnia ' s problems , but more particularly serbia ' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around serbia .    4.254962843610566
this is the new element that we must help to bring to the balkans .    3.9454699257029424
we must increase our efficiency in this area . we must reopen the danube to boats .    3.745234755062333
it is contradictory to offer aid to romania and bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to UNK their greatest resource .    3.0654157972713536
we must UNK the river and , in view of this , over the next few days the commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem .    4.382987396459053
we have done a lot in the balkans : the new european reconstruction agency for kosovo , the balkans task force and new regulations to speed up procedures .    3.866489524945174
nevertheless , we definitely have to do more .    3.3209272792045352
we must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the european union ; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries - old isolation ; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic , pluralist society in these countries with institutions , public structures , police forces and a structured civil society , but , above all , we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region , as regards both politics and the economy .    4.146591408562232
if we do not do this , we shall have failed in our duty .    3.9044770336581904
remember that the marshall plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources : it was even more effective because it made us europeans work together towards a new horizon ; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy .    3.4325018316590827
this is what we need to do for the balkans .    3.405486120737894
europe must prove - in the balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security , peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage .    3.802155865759574
we are clearly , once again , returning to enlargement , which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security , peace and freedom .    3.554412473973468
we have made many promises in this regard , but i believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread .    3.8873984617420954
indeed , enlargement , which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond - i am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries - must hinge on concrete , objective criteria , and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and , to an even greater degree , public opinion in our own member states .    3.95727862107619
there will be friendship , calm , openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process .    3.1057210418645056
i repeat : we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own member states with even greater UNK .    4.12422725334762
our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement , or at the balkans .    3.468523300804631
there are certain other key issues : relations with ukraine , relations with russia , relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly , the important question of relations with the southern mediterranean which will be a crucial point for european history , and for security and peace in europe for future generations . in this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of africa .    4.153566147974708
africa is , for us , a worrying topic for discussion . we therefore have another duty at international level , which has already been proposed by the commissioner responsible for trade : the undertaking to relaunch the millennium round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries , not just in terms of writing off debts , but also via the unilateral opening - up to trade with the poorest countries in the world , with a great deal of willingness on our part , which we had already proposed prior to seattle but which we could not put into practice .    4.685516119026845
we need to provide alternative answers , otherwise episodes such as those seen in seattle will be repeated over and over and will come to hamper one of europe ' s positive roles in history .    3.3882112015038737
all over the world , europe ' s actions must be guided by a deep respect for the principles of freedom and respect for the rights of individuals and minorities .    4.426687984913422
we should remember that we , the european union , are a union of minorities : we are all a minority within europe .    4.620793893758659
there are concerns even within the fifteen , concerns which may even surface again in the next decade .    4.061357135308698
i am referring to the situation in austria , where the commission has remained true to its role , being duty - bound to work towards the cohesion of the union , but also the unwavering guardian of the treaties , ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy , law and respect for minorities .    3.8086691721283685
some people have criticised me over the UNK message i sent to chancellor schüssel .    3.124018163178387
my message to you is : do not take the necessary and proper UNK of form to mean that i have been less firm in the content .    3.8497768086288797
UNK the letter : the reference to the fundamental values of the union is taken - and this is more than mere coincidence - from article 6 of the treaty , i repeat , article 6 of the treaty .    3.5015350378529613
i would also ask you whether you believe that any other european head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the commission when they were elected .    3.755649212314238
this is what we wish to do : maintain our role as a supranational structure , maintain the role conferred on us by the treaties , but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts .    3.41662615157034
i would ask the council to adopt it swiftly and i would ask parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion .    3.5910038008265737
i will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme : the economy and quality of life .    3.434656664643451
i have already talked about the economy : we well know which basic ingredients will set europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs .    2.9364485059410463
we must continue to keep inflation under control , proceed with liberalisation , ensure more competition , encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies ; push forward with science , and push back scientific boundaries , and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science .    2.9866093735238612
the forthcoming lisbon summit on these issues - dissemination of technology , employment - will be a decisive summit .    3.76073361760883
it has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind .    3.620613479437459
we are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers .    3.0951393570398738
finally , our last commitment is to improve quality of life .    3.1963580050784697
we have opened this chapter with the white paper on food safety : we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector .    3.3520002467316097
the erika oil slick and the contamination of the danube demonstrates the pressing need for european scale intervention to safeguard the environment .    3.338350419552733
the time has come to discuss , and then establish , a body for emergency civil protection in europe .    3.0012925365585983
all too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred .    3.6681442171820287
i think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen .    2.805009256117106
these are the challenges that we - the commission but also all the other european institutions - are facing .    3.620269943834123
how will we judge , ladies and gentlemen , madam president , the five years of our mandate ?    4.228165574366273
how are we going to assess the results of these five years ?    3.533579734114983
i do not know , but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together .    3.509352047522828
let us take a very simple parameter : turnout at the next european elections .    2.7210376398306537
if it is higher than at the previous elections , it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge .    4.238173951193932
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , we are faced with all these major political challenges , but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway , we are also faced with major opportunities .    3.77330848082289
this , ladies and gentlemen , could be the decade of europe . indeed , i would say that this must be the decade of europe .    4.242452992906136
madam president , mr president of the commission , the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate .    3.095853370075498
we also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .    3.0870173560579057
and we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which president prodi has just given .    3.419449424293832
we read in the conclusions in the document that the five - year term of office of the prodi commission will be a time of major changes .    4.558516053245848
europe will press ahead with integration ; at the same time the union will start an enlargement process which will , in the end , UNK our continent .    4.070750938728715
a demanding , ambitious , perhaps even UNK task and we wish you every success , mr president of the commission .    3.085170729983316
however , we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present .    4.632120582223298
i refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the european union .    4.038785482325039
we belong together , even when there are problems .    4.219138139660599
now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying europe .    3.653600745757877
mr president of the commission , you have represented and defended the european parliament time and again over recent weeks .    4.145226423075177
you have seen yourself as the guardian of the treaties , and that is indeed your role .    3.5771828417064033
for that and for the letter to the federal chancellor of the republic of austria which you mentioned , we expressly respect , acknowledge and support you .    3.901158953504571
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
mr president of the commission , our objectives are one and the same : we want a strong europe in the twenty - first century , a democratic europe which is able to act .    3.563681213254494
europe ' s message , the european union ' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even european nationalism , no ; it must be one of cooperation , partnership and peaceful development .    4.660132401604513
globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world , which is becoming smaller and smaller , as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity .    4.562091218581121
seen in this light , globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger , more of a coming together than a UNK , more mutual enrichment than separation .    3.8553519652490023
but we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as europeans .    3.58534633947976
globalisation is not only an economic process , it is also a cultural process , which is why we say : we want partnership in the world , we do not want the clash of UNK which many are UNK , we want partnership , a meeting , exchange and peace .    4.960383877368218
but we also say : we want to defend this european community of tolerance , which is why a common foreign , security and defence policy is so important .    4.413570636191564
negotiations with six central european countries are starting today , bringing the european family a step closer together .    3.2327731624415805
we agree with what you said about the barcelona process .    3.178774010662798
all the countries in the mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law .    3.0339661132653295
for us , the group of the european people ' s party and the european democrats , it is not only the reform of the institutions of the european union which will be important in the next five years ; it is also important that we declare our faith in the single european currency and use the policy of stability as a basis for consolidating the european currency in coming years .    4.179971626667748
we therefore take the UNK view that we must maintain a UNK and consistent stability pact .    4.399133822827193
we need structural reforms in the european economy .    4.546844007044237
it would be europe ' s UNK if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium - sized businesses in europe .    3.683935701271458
( applause ) the commission has an important role to play here by getting a coordinated policy under way with the nation states to reduce taxes so that entrepreneurship pays .    3.4091080803652476
we too want to help put europe on its feet .    3.7082777256233026
you spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity .    2.866064384701516
we support that .    3.3968793685270144
the nations , regions , towns and communities of europe will be preserved .    3.660797705526785
however , there is a current trend - the " fauna , flora , habitat " directive was quoted as an example - which , in my country at least , creates the impression that associations are UNK national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to brussels and that brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural UNK in the countries of the european union .    3.584281088854734
i merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where i would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future .    3.7849222407648386
if you are persuasive in your actions , we all reap the benefits .    3.410183824670194
if we have the UNK suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the european union , and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case - , but if european law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement UNK , precisely because peace in the european union is founded on this law .    4.375151040711362
we must preserve this law and peace in the european union if we are to be able to go forth as UNK in the world .    4.199386855457153
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
madam president , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , first of all i would like to welcome the presentation of , and the first ever debate on , the commission ' s programme for government - the word president prodi is so fond of ; as i am - for the whole legislature .    3.661846699847469
firstly , this is welcome because it explains , to our fellow citizens , what we are intending to do and what we are already doing . we must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future .    4.770426735492639
we are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances .    2.875722749456054
president prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation , a paradox in the european union and also throughout the world : we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium , dominated by the web of the internet and the UNK of UNK advance , and we are living through a genuine change of UNK .    4.093427347137976
however , to focus on the european union as it is today , and on the subject of government and governance - a word which , at least in spanish , brings to mind the previous name of the ministry of internal affairs , although it may be an appropriate word anyway - , the most important thing is that the european union be provided with a good government , and , since president prodi always defends his home town , UNK , i would advise him to go to UNK for a while and see something which we all understand : the UNK of UNK UNK , which speak of UNK governo [ good government ] and UNK governo [ bad government ] .    4.68224767450679
what we need here is good government , madam president .    2.9870744862385643
i would like to remind the house of something which we often forget , and that is that the investiture of the prodi commission , last september , received wide support . in our opinion , this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of europe .    4.098513604256844
i would like to point out that , within this broad consensus , there were some groups which said that the majority of parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the council .    3.4987643961361417
it is precisely this which , in a sense , is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme .    3.5544059943044455
i am pointing this out because i believe that our support for the commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature .    4.5308964517224055
on the other hand , we are witnessing the birth of a political europe , which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon , and a european union at the service of the citizens .    3.755819406267409
with regard to the events of recent days , i would like to say - and i am saying this on the day , and the week , that the intergovernmental conference is starting - we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which , given what we have said about the austrian crisis , i believe should be fully included in the treaties .    4.9403638134743275
i have absolutely no doubt about this and i believe it is an essential point .    4.9158723432873686
in this regard , madam president , i would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language .    3.144924967845952
last week , the new minister for finance of the austrian coalition described the austrian parliament as a farce and a theatre .    3.7412874024930693
those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments .    3.134312219734926
there can be no democracy without a living parliament .    2.6067140580240333
i believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and i would like to condemn it here and now .    3.8338946884976277
with regard to the four great priorities which president prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us , i would say that we are very much in agreement .    4.075221792431753
nevertheless , i would point out to the commission that , as far as the socialist group is concerned , there has been a change of priorities .    4.586707625343141
we understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda , which also includes what is known as ' quality of life ' priorities , that is to say , the rights of citizens as consumers and as people , in relation to those questions which we always talk about , but never give sufficient priority to , that is , the european social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances , consumer rights , respect for the environment and sustainable development .    4.112092459952698
when speaking of the commitment to full employment , we have to bear in mind that , these days , full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of UNK at the end of the second world war , that is to say , employment for the male head of the household .    3.6337591287339577
we must argue for equality of the sexes , the famous ' gender mainstreaming ' , which is one of the least developed questions in the prodi commission ' s programme .    3.726722828958996
this means prioritising sex equality , the adaptation of the social model and , above all , an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat .    3.5163426488312206
this must also be a main priority in the work of the commission . it must be complemented with a UNK fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise , in practice , the evolution of a union which has become a UNK for the rest of the world and an immigration zone , given its prosperity and seasonal UNK .    4.532095184524026
i believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue .    3.789499464937761
in this respect i would also add another element , which is economic government , given the single currency , and i believe this is UNK . this is another question on which the commission must make progress .    5.402126383511506
with regard to the ambitious objectives and , above all , the commission ' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration , i would like - and my group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of agenda 2000 .    4.105310492205423
does the commission think that there will be never be any revision ?    3.855314248976951
the issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential .    3.2498658642711074
with regard to governance in general , i believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms .    4.043855124932874
i would like to remind you of one thing : it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the european union from here .    3.238308128148772
i would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity .    4.011611465005441
if we are capable of defining what our area of governance is , i think that would be very positive .    4.375046730564534
in all other areas , i believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion .    3.688099767850507
not only should the commission discuss this , but also our states , our parliaments and our civil society .    3.7447895830820626
madam president , i would like to refer briefly to the last objective , which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental : the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the europe ' s role in the world .    3.40130588659509
we must not forget africa , a continent which has been UNK , not only by god , but also by europe , nor our important contribution to cooperating with development .    3.7517244019091307
lastly , an issue for which we are increasingly responsible , as the world ' s foremost economic and commercial power , that is , europe ' s voice in the world , which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the millennium round .    4.850221063651577
it means the reform of the united nations and the international financial institutions , for which europe has an enormous responsibility .    4.335166635426772
above all , madam president - and here i will end - we must be able to express this in plain language , clearly , by changing to some extent the jargon which we use , because we cannot ask the europeans , who are living through profound changes , to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely UNK .    4.324254543092509
this is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us . i hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next european elections .    3.5003125868120692
mr president of the commission , may i say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure , the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this house today : that is that the UNK now are UNK political .    4.338122171089401
they are political because we are moving on .    3.6545227616548868
even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks , we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of europe to a much more challenging political perspective .    3.710867992848259
the challenge of enlargement is political .    3.3092873645952814
the challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs , of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime , is very political .    3.3726417486954343
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political .    3.3118836112981445
because it is political it is more complex .    3.184541688923674
because it is political it is more sovereignty - sensitive .    2.5927681132579985
because it is more sovereignty - sensitive it is more UNK - and citizen - sensitive .    3.5352312315105885
we need , therefore , to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives , to address , not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy , the apathy which you identify .    3.4674919372526696
the means of achieving this are difficult but they are real .    3.7563938012045157
i applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions , not just between commission and parliament , but also between these and the council to UNK the extent of the political challenge .    5.385503081569698
we need more dialogue , not just with each other but also with civil society .    3.797599000320091
we need more explanation of what europe is about .    3.1234789242536345
we need to be able to confront fears and anxieties , because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself .    3.0491167150028393
perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that .    3.303611132216854
my group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a white paper next spring addressing the issue of governance .    3.6465346942811125
as we look at the europe of networking which you describe , it is very important that europe concentrates on its core business , that we have the courage to suggest areas where europe may perhaps stand back .    4.144446623933215
that could convince people that europe , in its governance , is not something run exclusively from brussels , which concentrates and UNK up more powers , more decisions , more authority .    3.7295922767615473
that is the political core of the challenge and i think you have identified it well before this house today .    4.007132707434981
for my group , enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured , be they governance , be they the intergovernmental conference , be they reform of the institutions .    4.2883576256810665
we see enlargement as a process of partnership , not a process of " them and us " .    3.7486458698281164
we see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states .    2.7549232254369636
i suggest to the commission , as a UNK of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement , to present a document , that explains the value of enlargement , not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense ; a document , like the UNK report before the single act , that explains to people in a way which UNK them in the debate that this is the grand , historic challenge facing europe today .    4.8230218934922515
we need to be able to prepare that ground carefully .    3.116630587966876
in the UNK of this commission and this parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south - eastern europe .    3.4852664752027906
we applaud the stabilisation and association agreements , but we would like to see more .    4.292610842242415
we will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the swoboda report later this week .    3.6605991570528134
the strategic paper emphasises the global role of the european union .    3.088351582148271
our central aim must be to give the union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid , trade and finance .    4.081050064214929
at the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end , and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies , where we fit into un agencies and so on .    2.859973720084573
we need to open that debate .    3.1532943346793396
in conclusion , this morning , the day after st valentine ' s day , the newspapers are saying that your UNK period is over .    3.0518056975760524
i do not know whether you are a UNK or not , mr prodi .    3.6132284665458925
perhaps this is a very UNK thing to say on such a morning .    3.917150595517336
however , we in the liberal group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business .    3.5128583211244773
that is the way it should be .    3.934019474386194
regarding the many UNK descriptions of europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic europe , an enterprising europe , a europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me , in a word dear to the heart of my liberal colleagues , give in one UNK , one description of the kind of europe we want to see in your plan for governance : an enabling europe .    3.546170934680736
madam president , mr president of the commission , i greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the european union must change fundamentally .    3.372816012437661
you gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme .    3.5042602327987535
i believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day - to - day ones .    3.2770432971443517
at the same time , however , it has to be said that , unfortunately , your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto .    3.652359394008285
there are a lot of good intentions in it , but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved .    4.161451154539189
as in any other party manifesto , it is full of contradictions .    4.260986297395107
i would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them .    2.5890430428702893
first let me speak about the economy and social development .    3.663026388951435
we have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment ; that is what was mentioned in your programme .    4.124457011260418
should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria , in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no member state should be higher than , say , the three most successful countries in this matter ?    3.926880662870132
ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of , because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure . but , unfortunately , as we all know , this is an area where the european union is totally unable to act .    4.495205740193338
do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .    3.130793865904944
the eu can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone .    3.4696629503830945
in this respect , parliament will definitely defend , along with yourselves , the importance of supranational decision - making .    3.52846795564277
one contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation .    3.093148772853062
i think it is very UNK that you should mention the concept of ' global administration ' , as others too have said here .    3.844799789954629
however , please learn from the events of seattle : we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade , on the one hand , with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend , on the other .    4.726189890233309
you must embark on a dialogue with the international community .    3.191669701816924
do please try to make the international organisations democratic .    3.9856580621290965
the european union could be critically important in a process in which the united nations and the wto really do become subject to democratic monitoring .    4.007841202929993
we can submit motions for this together with you .    3.034876645406147
finally , i consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society , although , unfortunately , this is another contradiction .    3.720116180123958
you ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the igc .    4.201439931418221
we have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision - making .    3.1975541295741805
what you just said is absolutely true : people want more engaged democracy .    3.0020222219688764
in my opinion , this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to europe and their interest in europe too .    4.291285132822991
madam president , my group was one of those which wanted to have a document allowing an exchange of views on the commission ' s strategic objectives within the group before this debate , instead of being reduced to an on - the - spot reaction in plenary .    3.966745615354908
the main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists .    4.09199766231789
we are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which mr prodi has just underlined and , in some cases , usefully clarified .    3.50064985534216
the current globalisation process is - and i quote - ' exclusive rather than inclusive and has widened the inequalities ' . the european union ' s objective must therefore be to help define new ground rules within the union and in international relations .    3.8274136717617018
clearly , many citizens are ' UNK and anxious ' about the lack of real and lasting solutions to basic problems , such as unemployment and social exclusion , which affect our very existence . this must be one of our absolute priorities .    3.8214756867710014
we do need to rethink many aspects of current community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success . we also need ' distinctive strategic partnerships ' with our neighbours to the south and east in order to achieve stability and peace .    3.881160550482652
there are plenty of areas for serious discussion .    3.064469484372687
we will carefully study the planned white papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised .    3.2514472436425996
it is in this spirit that i have three criticisms to make . these must be taken into account if we are truly to shape the new europe , as proclaimed UNK by the title of the commission document and mr prodi ' s speech and do so in reality not rhetoric .    4.3655575962327395
the first and most serious criticism concerns the commission ' s UNK for rather UNK self - satisfaction with regard to the european union and for a UNK and even UNK view of our partners .    4.526751766212618
the perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the commission communication .    3.9315393019838605
this talks of the european union as ' living proof that peace , stability , freedom and prosperity can be brought to a continent ' and as a model showing the world the way forward . it concludes that ' our neighbours have the chance to join this prosperity , and we have a golden opportunity to enable them to do so ' .    4.112077259764685
a more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view .    3.2489863860341117
my second criticism follows on from the first .    3.4409328291377776
this extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and , where necessary , confronting these is seriously limiting the will , duly confirmed by mr prodi , to grant public demands .    3.612969308007957
for example , at least in the countries which i know well , i doubt that the intention , repeated three or four times in the commission document , to reform ' europe ' s social protection , health care and pension systems UNK a climate of more cautious public spending ' will meet the needs of those whose confidence we apparently want to win back .    3.9344561830990488
my third criticism stems from the first two . the weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an UNK of generalisations , a rather UNK approach and therefore a lack of impetus .    3.45059114064336
but all is not lost .    3.3193170051015803
this is a starting point and we have five years to succeed , provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity .    3.7483178477948758
madam president , reforming and UNK the institutions of the european union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .    3.636647288831939
this was the opening statement of commission president , prodi , when he presented the strategic objectives of the european commission for the next five years .    4.016043360902579
we await the white paper on the governance of the european union dealing with the issue of balance between member states ' governments and the european union institutions which is to be published this summer .    4.890053369382949
on this specific point i think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision - making procedures of the commission .    4.27161830523468
the commission , in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference , has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller member states lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the european commission .    3.2603738761770193
this is a scenario whereby the european union has a membership of over 25 member states .    3.315930300886137
i do not want to see a two - UNK european union built .    2.9161528401927788
i believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the treaty of rome and all subsequent treaties .    3.4609323058114696
there must be equality in terms of national representation within the commission and within all the other european institutions .    4.268622647829943
i would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small member states to nominate a european commissioner that the united states of america gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the united states senate .    3.781802631622461
more or less each of the 50 states in the us has two elected positions in the united states senate , regardless of its population .    4.321277815349947
any future reforms of the european union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country .    4.4808429951340605
it would be very difficult for those who propose a ' yes ' vote in any such future treaty to win the support of the irish people if we lose our right to have our UNK to the european commission .    3.483922200185057
undoubtedly , reform of the european council is also going to be included in this white paper on the governance of the european union which will be published this summer .    4.533523049862521
once again there are special areas of policy - making which should be left to the domain of the national member states .    3.564901486453905
i do not believe that there is broad support in europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation , justice and home affairs , and foreign affairs at european union level .    3.173000532950574
i believe that this proposal should remain , as a common european taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the european union .    3.1353767278553732
i support the enlargement of the european union .    2.9041571310760146
i support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner .    3.980027296145328
however , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the european union is a vital factor in changing the eu treaties .    3.451650832275437
changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping , otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future european union treaty very difficult indeed .    3.492745285478948
madam president , i am speaking on behalf of the italian radical members .    2.5071975739943584
president of the commission , a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five - year plans .    3.7814768783539088
this is true , if we think of russia ' s plans in the thirties , but at the start of your mandate , a few months ago , you yourself announced at the conference of presidents that you would , however , be presenting a legislative programme , or rather , the major policy lines of the european government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today .    4.522958233217782
so , whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme , the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions , or rather a list of issues on the table . it does not , however , give us the impression that the commission is taking a clear position on any of these points , but that it is just doing the european commission ' s duty .    5.033962206089166
in this house , in the past , large - scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the commission , under its power of initiative , launched , not as experiments , but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress , but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the european union .    4.272547703829334
in this case , mr prodi , we certainly have a kind of " ten UNK " : a whole raft of issues are listed , but if i may say so , we are left with the impression that the commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points .    3.9479781170629558
there was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease " unnecessary " activities .    3.883749545041449
we should be careful , though , mr prodi , because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous commission and backed this commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this commission - precisely because , first and foremost , the reform of the commission would bring consolidation , a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand .    3.98456304725411
let us consider the scenario whereby the commission , not believing itself to be equal to the task , wishes , or proposes to shed , for example , its powers to implement common policies , which it is nevertheless accorded by the treaty .    4.106964488774468
what do we expect from a government in any case ?    3.8026879148784842
what do we ask of this structure - the european community - which is , so to speak , ambiguous and unique ?    4.120380917234465
it is right for joint resources to be controlled UNK and not to be delegated to the member states or the taos , as has been the case in the past .    3.752213751248908
it seems that you are proposing the same old UNK , but with more unsatisfactory implications , restricting the commission , so you say , to the task of drawing up a few white papers , as you proposed .    4.96109369476092
my fear - even if you shake your head , mr prodi - is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years , that the commission should be a simple secretariat for the council of ministers .    4.307924824638925
if this is the role that the commission intends to play over the next five years , we federalists are convinced , we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the commission intends to do in this regard .    4.736726091340337
the reform is important but , if it aggravates the situation , reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the commission , then the structure of european integration , as planned by the founding fathers for the european commission , will be at risk .    4.731010030063867
   3.7318943719743674
as for the other points , mr prodi , i will take economic and social policy as an example : the european social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not UNK that unemployment UNK the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve , but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past , without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective .    4.598767662963782
if we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far , i do not know what we or the commission will be able to do .    3.810262978536
the same goes for enlargement as an end in itself , without it being linked to a reform to make the european union and its structures much more efficient , and to proposals that the commission could have made at the igc .    4.087501856808489
mr prodi , there is one positive thing that i would like to say to you , perhaps contrary to the opinion of some members , regarding the telegram that you sent to the austrian government .    4.599338262691404
we approve of your position on this : you did well not to isolate that country any further .    3.7749061675544646
in any case , we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action .    3.3193949949211454
mr prodi , i repeat that this is , in our opinion , a slightly short - sighted view .    4.786374257172213
above all , it lacks drive in the sectors i have mentioned , for example , as regards the balkans .    4.0277213581751665
can we really continue to leave the balkans out of the enlargement process , disregarding the fact that croatia , macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this house that is open to all ?    4.417175371384407
madam president , mr prodi , i should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the union ' s activities and ask why , then , you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation .    4.3205008570509085
i remember your predecessor ' s speech five years ago .    3.249698888702103
like yourself , he promised " less and better " , but mr santer finished up by having delivered " much more and much worse " , and i do not believe that you , either , can deliver the goods you promise .    3.5954921736886503
you talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation .    2.878322882810025
the legislative programme is , in fact , a UNK of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which , mr prodi , you are to take influence away from the people , even on social questions .    4.783945792853738
you talk about greater transparency , but produce proposals which would lead to documents which , at present , are available for public inspection being locked away .    3.694253385348731
your commission consists of the only 20 people in the eu who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced .    3.78560229605917
local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in brussels .    3.9119224539032484
the legislative programme from the commission ought at least , therefore , to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the member states and to the processes of popular democracy . otherwise , the number of laws produced in brussels will just keep on growing .    4.7715583926468925
we have passed 10 000 laws and as many amendments , and the applicant states have had 26 000 documents sent to them which , as debated by the polish parliament , fill 140 000 sides of paper .    3.7399411445885784
even by this stage , that is already too many by far .    4.687861745338412
what is more , the work carried out in brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent , so that people might at least have some small sense of UNK the process , now that mr prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them .    3.802378678143028
i should also just like to draw mr UNK ' UNK ' s attention to what the founding fathers of the european union dreamed of . take a look at jean UNK ' s UNK .    4.341079155153892
what he envisaged was what he called a small , practical secretariat .    3.4430597969403527
that is not what mr prodi is president of today .    3.1064316850839844
madam president , this morning the commission president , mr prodi , has set out ambitious goals for the european union for the next five years , laudable aims indeed , to make a strong and effective european presence felt in the world : UNK with enlargement , meeting the challenge of selling e - europe , introducing better principles of governance .    3.73626815013749
we accept that europeans , particularly the UNK generation , need to be given a broad perspective of where europe will be in the years ahead .    3.813925252989843
but how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high ?    3.495903205101069
we need to match this vision with reality .    2.929899044645582
here there are three elements i would like to contribute .    4.347550642020213
firstly , we need a successful european economy .    3.229933769513693
we must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across europe , confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation , encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the internet , show that e - europe is a good initiative .    3.482729862649462
but we must avoid UNK back into the old - style regulation , stifling individual initiative and enterprise .    3.1814235070874606
we must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society .    3.4527361233309306
without a successful european economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead , particularly of enlargement .    3.421682539869741
secondly , we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity .    3.190610290569745
we will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation .    3.1360999768256628
mr bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction .    4.200559848665882
we must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes .    3.2995504352295497
lastly , we need to ensure that there is proper , genuine reform of the european commission .    3.8820415571060165
yes , the commission - guardian of the treaties - is meant to be an independent body , but it also has to be accountable to european citizens through our parliament .    5.034186914024999
the information problem , which mr bonde just referred to , is treated like a straw in the wind , with the commission UNK to restrict information to us , as citizens and as parliamentarians , although we have the right to it under the treaties .    4.154364742695934
the commission is not in fact today a european government .    2.9792710617387494
the commission does not reflect the majority in this particular parliament .    3.511538219768338
we in parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in europe .    3.3512704031998735
this governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the european union , has its relevant role to play .    4.647598528111115
therefore we need to have credibility , coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the european union to our citizens .    4.024373005353264
madam president , mr president of the commission , numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the european union , from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy ; even to the response by the 14 , the commission and parliament to the new coalition in austria .    4.391187537027784
i fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions .    3.591947334987719
nonetheless , i agree with you , mr president of the commission , that many more steps to strengthen the european union will be needed in the future because the european union is not strong enough either to master the huge , inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which , to put it UNK , have an ambivalent attitude towards european values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent .    4.171225448640186
that does not apply to austria alone .    3.335523369980958
the union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the treaty of amsterdam and the institutions of the eu confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in austria .    3.402757269745412
however , the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the treaty and , in the final analysis , represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens .    4.025467648429799
when it comes down to it , articles 6 and 7 of the treaty are not enough .    3.515148782372177
in this sense , the commission must insist , and i should like to endorse and confirm this here , that the new charter of fundamental rights become part of the treaty and create binding , enforceable rights .    4.526645525688003
in this sense , the commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom , security and justice and in this sense i disagree with the last two speakers .    3.4921863355521565
only reasonable , feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational , misleading and UNK allegations of the extreme right .    2.683763007157012
but , and i would like to stress this , this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment , marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti - european , nationalistic actions and reactions .    3.567414041347806
in this respect , mr president of the commission , i too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large UNK of the population .    3.9513578685516233
the feeling of being at the mercy of others , of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote , as in the european elections and , in the worst case scenario , to extremist voting UNK .    3.9835499228938205
the union , like everyone else , has not yet understood how to present the eu to the citizens of the eu as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation .    4.4977617174727405
what we need are not just reforms of the world trade organisation and the economic architecture - and , significantly , the president of the commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture ; we also need confidence - building measures for our citizens , who rightly expect help and support from and in the eu with the inevitable and UNK process of adapting to new global circumstances .    4.117530421467177
in this respect , what the commission says about boosting europe ' s voice is important .    3.547328879337387
in this sense , the usa is not only our partner ; it is also our competitor ; not our UNK , our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model .    3.827261119594646
i hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the commission documents .    4.376113277090689
madam president , mr president of the commission , the greatest legacy which your commission could pass on to the european union would be to help UNK and redistribute the increasingly UNK and confused powers and competences of the commission , and perhaps of the union itself .    4.124304802863738
you have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so - called " core tasks " .    3.5399079328023455
that , as you have said yourself today , means that you must also identify tasks , policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the commission ' s main UNK .    3.9546393684522996
many existing european union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell - by date , or have been proved UNK or ineffective when administered at european level .    3.069057458203148
the challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non - core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national , regional and local government .    3.2752937936276787
if we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical european public of the merits of further european integration , we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted eu powers as we are in the evolution of new eu powers .    3.8895666051121944
we must not allow the critics of european integration to claim , as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from mr bonde , that the increase in eu responsibilities is a one - way street only .    3.9149246958880384
it must be shown to be a two - way process in which existing eu policies and programmes , which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality , are UNK and repealed .    4.317863769094325
if you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the european union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this european parliament .    4.389321275821718
madam president , you spoke about fundamental political values , and one of the fundamental political values , even more important than democracy , is respect for others .    3.4209198952499777
we therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of UNK or nazism . democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong , but also listening to their explanations .    3.3667229107178027
enlargement - and UNK UNK has been repeating this for ten years in this house - must not mean dilution , that is , it must not entail more risks .    4.733896892343411
the applicant countries ' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens , who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way europe works , as it is not resolving the most serious problems .    4.061492757186628
we therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which - should it be necessary - need to be UNK with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in romania , reaching as far as belgrade , but above all , the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues .    3.9815317923546494
even today , we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power UNK in the eastern republics .    4.180641864610166
we therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement , so that we can at last establish a european monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions , with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur .    3.7170911798252053
i would also like to say a few words on africa , madam president .    2.4169148049687985
the third and fourth worlds have been abandoned : just one dollar , one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children .    3.2806786137189525
europe , which is so democratic , so progressive , does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board , while half of africa is dying of aids and other diseases .    3.462955319573368
one final remark regarding the internet and globalisation .    3.5915532763073386
globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification , just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean UNK of values or UNK of hopes and enthusiasm .    3.761877400145592
the peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an UNK that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few .    3.5300958915492826
as for the internet , europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules .    4.393913942457697
we live in a world of rules and regulations : let us regulate the internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future .    3.5035734391593594
madam president , as a padanian taxpayer , i have already experienced the vice - like grip of the UNK and former prime minister of italy , mr prodi , since UNK is liable to italy for its taxes as well .    3.888303463803343
listening to him just now , i was concerned when he mentioned new resources , something that readily translates as additional taxation , in view , inter alia , of enlargement , that is the entry of new states into the union .    4.328248282856841
but why do they not buy their own entrance ticket ?    3.0601266492083634
my padanian electorate who , thanks to mr prodi , have already paid what in italy is known as the european tax - UNK only in part - have absolutely no intention , thanks once again to mr prodi , of paying another tax for someone else .    4.005445039725132
madam president , mr president of the commission , members of the commission , five months after its coming into office , the commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the european union .    3.9048450746280974
the ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic .    3.249514957644682
is it not rather UNK to say that " the world looks up to europe " ?    3.990235171553186
moreover , europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen eu member states .    3.5497853591468034
it is not rather ambitious to ensure peace , democracy and human rights in the whole of europe , no less ?    4.242874443728553
i am particularly UNK by how the commission considers bringing this about .    3.6012041220524194
does " the european integration model as a rich source for global administration " imply the export of a large - scale perspective and concentration of power ?    3.4849954027320247
according to the commission , external policy can succeed , provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge !    3.8418717094274166
so who is this then ?    3.387323050669801
the commission as a whole , its president perhaps , the council ?    4.0727280611237955
you stated that the new european government requires strong institutions , while the commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks .    4.174631627045111
we could not agree more with the latter .    2.6369889947688123
it is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross - border issues and stopped UNK out the european cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .    2.9697011731909377
the document mentions common values on different occasions .    3.0237504943357476
unfortunately , i find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking .    3.6275382454376297
this raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on .    3.766686287572482
i am convinced that the UNK , god ' s word , is the only pure source of proper standards and real values .    3.728117735884109
in the tradition of our continent , this realisation is an important one which merits recognition .    3.56592246917702
madam president , mr president of the commission , ladies and gentlemen , i am not sure which to go by : the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010 ?    2.9566833930547545
have you already included your second term of office ?    3.3207433976731173
as it UNK , the union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and UNK .    4.640243092448734
first , streamlining .    3.164312206589444
what you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the commission is only the beginning .    4.478721748884359
the activities of the entire union must be reduced to core areas of policy .    3.795629361040127
in other words , a social , ecologically - orientated market , a secure currency , guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally .    2.8582235547939625
it is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice ; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important .    5.664886991288992
secondly , the new " in " word is flexibility .    3.1770918776986776
however , increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into UNK .    3.007650578692584
we must hold fast to joint decision - making institutions which embrace the member states .    3.1753737821504027
that also applies to the inclusion of the civil society , which is a welcome step .    3.787282818473285
our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers .    3.187047561449673
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
transparency does not mean more access to more paper ; to our citizens , transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in brussels and strasbourg , when and with what right .    4.0948930514389525
that is transparency .    3.2184998374875486
thirdly , the european union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly .    3.9440624903204258
its borders are set not by how may countries want to join , but by how many countries it can accommodate .    3.5864785437819307
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
if the price of enlargement is the watering - down or even the break - up of the present union , then it must not be paid .    4.022709867747851
it is too high a price , not only for the member states already in the union but also for the states which want to join the union .    4.568459993337963
there is no future for a union which is merely a UNK - strategic concept or for a union which is merely a free trade zone .    3.232906063114268
but the union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of europe if it sees itself as a community of UNK .    4.555800523629106
that goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new , better quality of life .    3.251626581842501
not only the commission , not only the european parliament but also the people and the states in our european union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together .    5.889197215653394
in doing so , we need , no less , to reinvent the european union , but without destroying the present union .    4.329698272170011
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
madam president , in the opinion of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party , the most important task of the commission and the whole union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement .    4.112872126427554
the commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the union as soon as possible .    3.1707924794060354
on the other hand , we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down .    3.111000487007405
to avoid this the european liberal democrats have expressed the hope that the intergovernmental conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric union , in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring .    4.169217886767584
it is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the union will be raised at the igc .    4.1054224170205975
the subject needs to be discussed without prejudice .    4.050037167827405
a technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough : we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by jacques delors , for example .    4.2700756433203875
in this way , a decision - making system can be created that is more effective , clearer , more open and more democratic .    3.1051311541887787
i hope that the commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding union might implement its institutional and other differentiation .    2.903428243635361
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , your inspiring speech , mr prodi , has quite won me over .    2.864369913229161
it raises expectations , but it can also lead to disappointment .    4.5101402174414895
this is connected to what mr van velzen was just saying , about the difference between words and deeds .    3.2361718195773967
the enlargement of the union is inspired by our wish for peace , security and stability .    4.216376293226332
you are looking to reassure the acceding countries , as well as european opinion .    3.774394861232679
but these days , we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes .    3.518439716291927
we have noted increasing levels of UNK and UNK , even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high .    3.7926830122708948
we need to make our citizens feel at home , according to mr swoboda , and i agree .    4.647763947584032
this is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility .    3.3511037184697416
this is probably linked to the standards mentioned by mr van dam , namely subsidiarity .    3.606309993426758
it is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners , rather than competitors when it comes to policy .    3.975240207471183
it is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens , where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves .    3.6573330968872
that will require a new political culture , not only in words , but also in practice , which will take into consideration the reality of member states and regions .    4.513393864494299
regions which , culturally and economically , sometimes match the interest of some member states .    3.494348029318995
the new europe should not only expand UNK , but also UNK , by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community .    4.326643528296183
this is what the commission will be judged on .    3.4626871734526334
madam president , the commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 . these are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been UNK over to prevent any conflict .    3.8110807263405615
so , in the first part on the new forms of european governance , the words ' federalism ' and ' superstate ' are not mentioned at all .    3.7706805258449365
yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong european institutions in which only day - to - day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an UNK whole . in this scenario the governments and national parliaments are merged with the regional and even local authorities and with the civil society , all of which are described , with no form of hierarchy , as ' integral elements of european governance ' .    3.6527455538192575
these ambiguities UNK many misunderstandings , primarily about our values .    3.0063807885824017
it is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat .    3.8489812723157146
it must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate , fair and transparent democratic debate , namely at national level in the main .    3.8713838994539986
yet the whole of the commission communication is based on the opposite theory . in this theory , on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples , their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations , new policies or new , restrictive legal structures such as the draft charter of fundamental rights .    3.785603343494695
this charter is really UNK because it will actually reduce these rights .    3.8450076044707235
in the union for a europe of nations group our principles are rather different .    2.7404335682210474
clearly we want to defend the countries of europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations .    4.397319316195702
this is not impossible .    3.132419466607526
we must move away from the UNK federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on european matters comes from the UNK of jean UNK .    3.6742714027063013
instead , we must open the european institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations .    3.8234376608469107
this is the UNK idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication , mr prodi , but which is unfortunately not there .    4.089826986266884
madam president , mr prodi , you claim to be shaping a new europe yet you are lacking one basic element : confidence .    2.7548225971343347
the confidence of millions of europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this .    3.585767743058149
and how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the santer commission for corruption ?    2.9117625176934285
you are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty , insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra - trade - oriented and ultra - liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency .    3.177777530715496
you wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders . consequently , you have opened europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration .    3.3585045915723346
you are now proposing to give all decision - making power to a handful of officials . the member states , local authorities and ngos will simply become UNK of decisions handed down from above , all on an equal footing in their submission to brussels .    3.5936506604560914
not once does your twelve - page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people .    3.4850755315483073
clearly , they have no role to play in your strategy .    3.932408263753189
you dare not even call a spade a spade , but instead hide behind pseudo - UNK language by using the term ' governance ' for what is nothing more than federal , UNK , centralised government .    3.3378135291142166
having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty , you are now revealing your ultimate goal . you intend to trade in all european sovereignty , whether national or collective , for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position .    3.896392427546904
finally , you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of austrians , or are allowing this to happen , just because the result does not suit you .    3.209934916617
yet at the same time you are supporting communist china and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades .    3.5082742149578308
members of this house are today speaking out against a telegram from mr prodi to chancellor schüssel which , quite obviously , is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre .    3.5934919194893684
your UNK - UNK UNK no one because , as you know perfectly well , whether you like it or not , you need austria in order to reform the treaties and harmonise savings tax .    4.5259377017165185
you will UNK and hypocritically use austria as a convenient threat to further strip the member states of any real powers in the construction of the european union .    3.38413574436499
your commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this .    3.4493798305011647
the governments which , through spinelessness or ideology , support you are also responsible .    3.379043973281583
brussels is not all of us , as you claim . it is all of you .    5.83678856815464
tell the truth for once . you could not care less what the people of europe want .    3.750821651255576
they are free to choose only between your brave new world and UNK .    3.140093799462847
it is over ten years since the collapse of the soviet union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the UNK and UNK UNK .    3.1596959388133805
we were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship .    2.9054412544785224
we are and will remain among those fighting against europeanist dictatorship . we call on all the people of europe to resist your UNK projects .    3.5852429454518258
the salvation of european democracies is with nation states . europe ' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of europe .    3.474086680190291
( limited applause )    3.374053025118147
president prodi , today you have presented the commission ' s five - year programme , and it has many objectives that we endorse .    4.434910772251083
it is a programme based on real - life situations and issues , and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues .    4.061132998411612
in my view , mr prodi , judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us , one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance , and that is solidarity , not so much at international level as at internal level .    4.0126547444009715
the UNK of milan , UNK UNK maria UNK , is calling upon all politicians , in particular those like you and me , president prodi , for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of catholics in politics , to reconsider a development process , which , in addition to economic profit , takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account .    3.7269281826827765
it is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up , one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone .    3.919056526287645
it also reminds us of the need for a new growth model , one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the catholics who are involved in social problems , who see , in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public , the most natural instruments for building solidarity .    4.294087903124059
the fundamental element for the development of each person - his freedom , which comes before economic gain - is thus enhanced .    3.458205863965292
mr president , public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion .    3.348968862823966
they must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual , without forgetting , naturally , that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business , to invest and risk , and in an ordered and focused system , entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity .    3.9595787718604676
in the age of globalisation , which we do want to facilitate with a framework of specific rules that will provide guarantees to the economic operators and consumers , the european commission cannot forget solidarity , and must call for its implementation through the use of all of man ' s spiritual resources in his relations with his fellow man .    4.483986748223496
our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .    3.605512425067202
we hope that the white paper and the actions of you and your commission will put this into practice .    3.4714794951734245
madam president , mr president of the commission , ' shaping the new europe ' is an ambitious objective both for the commission and for us all .    3.457041861074781
our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries , but also by many people outside europe and the european union .    4.131726210548554
what sort of impression will an interested public , as well as the rest of the world , have of this five - year programme ?    3.56256085829189
my reply would be : a new start , a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the union in the UNK will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously .    4.238051374419065
the commission is correct in stating that the union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation .    3.5792441771654544
it foresees a just and more effective europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self - interest .    3.242480625141083
consequently , we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom .    3.145089640518035
i concur with what other members of my political group have said and i commend the tone of your document . however , there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work .    4.039476661993704
the first concerns women , gender and women ' s rights .    3.143606815964545
you talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth .    3.255443644365367
that is important , but equality is not only necessary for productivity , but also to make our societies more democratic .    3.6403215920368495
it is therefore noticeable that ' equality ' , ' gender ' and ' women ' are barely mentioned in ' shaping the new europe ' .    2.6806867143914963
you mentioned ' women ' in your speech , but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals .    3.910454412774845
is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the commission that there is no need to mention women ?    4.3570002960468015
what other explanation could there be for UNK women ?    3.177146120892228
the eu must not take on a masculine persona .    2.8380105421904664
my other question concerns africa , which is the only continent not mentioned in ' shaping the new europe ' .    3.3031314239250165
africa has the largest number of refugees in the world , the most overall poverty and a UNK aids epidemic .    3.6356622798960365
i know that commissioner nielson and some of the other commissioners are doing a fine job , but the rest of the commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent , partly by including it among its strategic goals .    4.187854918862128
finally , i welcome the commission ' s statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the eu is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets .    3.8575133568595374
i would merely ask when this is likely to take effect .    3.150213081889797
madam president , president of the commission , this is a vital document for the future and fate of europe .    3.9860378074143905
however , out of all the points , two specifically require our attention , and they are closely linked : peace and stability within europe and outside europe .    3.715361608934066
it is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority .    3.3216196490336922
for some time , we have all agreed on this notion , but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement , even if this comes at a price .    3.9858905034848737
today , we have been called on to choose , for the forthcoming decades , between a europe that might be less prosperous but a UNK of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a europe that might be more wealthy , but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring .    4.034781916720922
these goals will be more easily UNK only if the intergovernmental conference , which will draw to a close within the year , results in constitutional reform , providing the commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement council decisions or parliament ' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real european government .    4.419118415703437
the first supporter of this reform should be parliament itself , if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the europeans and acquire the UNK which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated union .    3.784384420429974
moreover , it will only be possible to give the commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded .    5.204417244607827
without these prospects that we have outlined , europe would , once again , have no future .    4.3936294775301015
madam president , mr prodi , we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which europe must overcome .    3.8572746856369737
i note that you consider the fall of the berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century .    3.7782133370176747
this event must underpin enlargement .    3.325644306480548
your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks . this is one of the goals of your reform .    3.809503545239631
in essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity .    2.8959875894211105
precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence .    3.729893715510887
however , saying is one thing and doing is another !    3.6835867911852516
you must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers .    3.4020117791148237
i will therefore judge you on your deeds .    2.962567476610773
however , i must make two essential points . these concern the simplification and application of community law .    3.0549760744269183
in 1998 , 123 UNK were made to the court of justice for non - application or non - transposition and 25 % of environmental directives were not applied or transposed .    3.3190295175152422
recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential .    4.078746657786684
community law must not go UNK because it is too complex or too UNK .    4.608733251701879
the union must not make this mistake and i therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this .    3.7229629242415108
you are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us , including unemployment .    4.152096144865542
nevertheless , i regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed .    3.7975001048199815
the emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility .    3.6729256230390486
you have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society , not only economically but also in terms of public health .    3.587211412682032
this is a silent revolution and in this respect i expected more from your communication .    3.418700630817773
finally , you do highlight european research as being at the heart of our future .    3.470852031227228
yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this .    4.077987453919122
also , ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these .    3.5276806977463067
if you want to better inform the people , you should start by strengthening liaison with this house , as we are the representatives of the citizens .    3.9384833841872595
madam president , we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five - year programme and of the programme for 2000 , set out with so much enthusiasm by president prodi this morning .    3.723715823459981
in the two documents , strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of european governance and , to this end , to introduce a new agenda for the commission , establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment , through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the states , and , primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation .    4.283755989547784
to this end , i shall confine myself to stressing , out of all the choices available , the importance of three priority decisions which should , in the drawing - up of action programmes for the government of the union , be the basis for both the commission ' s agenda and the actions of the european union in the coming months .    4.67580207219299
firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the european investment bank .    4.360391699416624
secondly , the approval of investments - where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment - to be made in individual countries via community projects in the priority sectors of research , innovation and training .    3.445515761690367
i feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature , resulting from investments in continuous training , UNK courses , adaptability and UNK of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives , that are always debatable , regarding new employment or employment cuts .    3.152332057761818
if , among other things , as the programme of the portuguese presidency stresses as well , the commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue , focusing on an agreed strategy of UNK and UNK of knowledge , in other words , a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules , this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and UNK management of the restructuring and UNK processes .    4.492627898548023
thirdly , i do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population , owing to the ageing of the population , is unavoidable and inevitable for the european union . this is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration , but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early UNK from the job market , and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems , certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people ' s increased life UNK and towards a longer working life .    3.8337118416639457
madam president , mr president of the commission , you have come here today , mr prodi , in a very UNK and ambitious mood .    4.048863968847361
i welcome you and your ambition .    3.42877955005671
ambition will be needed , given the mammoth task which awaits us .    3.5625271845172928
in order to make these reforms , however , and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme , we must be very sure , not only of the strengths of the reformer himself , but also of the opinions of others .    4.425605691503938
you say that you will not hesitate to come to this house to request more resources for the commission , but the commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice .    4.450008422100265
we have 1 . 27 % of the community ' s gdp .    3.815189152922821
not a euro more or a euro less .    3.227576030201038
it will not be us who refuse these new resources . you should ask the council .    3.44888613721351
these financial perspectives are UNK to within a UNK .    3.796329036541469
in order to finance the stability plan for the balkans , we will have to negotiate a significant revision of category 4 , and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget .    4.160595680523288
i would remind you that this group , the ppe - de , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .    3.498931805935831
the political priorities must be set by this house and the meps .    3.9042343401793267
do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the community financial system .    3.9537895451221874
it is all very well for us , by mutual consensus , to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation , but you must be very aware that the lack of resources , the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget , continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved .    4.478716528124798
we therefore wonder whether the commission has the political will to resolve them .    3.811991729216712
madam president , the commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever .    3.0790760124225103
we socialists applaud the commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty .    3.725782121284192
yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled ?    3.5769386172862387
what is meant by the commission ' s declared objective of ' economic reform ' in the labour market ?    4.042869711652136
does this mean more flexibility , insecurity and fixed - term contracts ?    2.993053815199481
everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth .    3.2504320426773643
the union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient .    3.736425983283488
we socialists desperately want a european pact for growth and employment .    2.7391989013276796
the ingredients of this policy are well known . they are the stimulation of public and private investment , increased investment in research , education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise .    3.7350459104805753
in this respect , the e - europe initiative is to be welcomed .    2.850637137783899
in the world of new technologies , the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are .    3.984647149297049
the gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era .    3.56597828217532
on one hand we have the UNK of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and , on the other , more widespread exclusion .    4.187746045114063
we are asking workers to be flexible , innovative and ever more productive , yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone .    3.2086916365031155
the european central bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets , yet it never UNK an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity .    3.1135897419125844
how do we explain to workers who fall victim to the UNK of the worldwide monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the UNK of industry , having lost the UNK of a take - over , leave with compensation of eur 30 million ?    3.8628729681108824
for years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised .    3.806176357449863
the sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions , leading inevitably to monopoly situations .    3.369318977094034
all these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15 % , 20 % or 25 % which are unrealistic in the long term .    2.8322002983877343
the UNK rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase .    3.4741071297411197
the main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets .    3.5594610880801225
to conclude , the next five years will be crucial .    3.065546224524368
we need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people . we need the member states and the commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner .    4.302327478199622
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , in my view , this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses .    2.871719269589318
there is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one .    3.501276548654393
i am thinking of transport policy and regional policy .    2.727190321872999
you have excellent commissioners for both issues in mrs palacio and mr barnier , yet still you attach too little importance to these areas .    3.1157758048404145
and do you know why ?    3.793107267436133
just look at transport policy ; clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries .    3.6155765846368886
i would be grateful if the president of the commission would listen to what i have to say , although of course he has no obligation to do so .    3.733281192328449
let me give you three examples .    3.175072046237212
first : we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways .    3.2776155784699466
that makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view .    3.5532093371540086
without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy .    3.8227434353144383
the same applies to european air traffic control .    2.821388492492682
our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic , but leaving 15 different sectors in the UNK which are under national control , which have an adverse economic impact on the UNK and which pollute the environment .    4.597371192971263
you still have not finished that agenda .    3.522826301315024
commissioner , far too little is said in your paper about regional policy .    3.358372520443827
economic and social cohesion in the eu is a fundamental task of this community .    4.590321190334691
if we fail to complete it , citizens in less favoured regions will UNK enlargement .    3.2160553561533884
we must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means .    3.529452619886864
then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it .    3.713351431232598
mr president of the commission , if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions , then this union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people .    4.296025380766224
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage .    3.4668112244754576
from that standpoint , it is useful that the commission ' s work programme comes back to the issues of agenda 2000 , the common agricultural policy , which includes fishing , and secondly , the activities of the structural funds .    4.649818229720027
i hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing agenda 2000 .    3.6697199816701755
the agenda 2000 issues are , of course , ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives , the economic and social agenda and a better quality of life .    3.3328535349303285
what your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major , high - minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the commission intends to deploy .    3.802260449090773
i do not necessarily mean financial resources .    3.1684228216413675
the implementation of agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money .    3.5373636980483307
there must also be savings .    3.3452235880674994
but what we need is the analytical resources : these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital .    3.010254117035588
this is because it is essential to achieve two things : the european model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured , and this must be done in a way which UNK the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products , mainly to the benefit of developing countries .    3.806468993907254
it is not easy to combine those aims . there is no obvious way .    3.2052196579343857
there may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them .    4.489088540650605
as regards the other aspect of agenda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development , there we do indeed have great achievements to point to , but there are still less developed regions , particularly island regions , to which more attention should be paid .    3.9249242033654466
as for fishing , there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the UNK exploitation of fishing grounds , which has gone as far as to UNK out entire species of fish , will certainly prove fruitful in the future .    4.370083767283269
perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater UNK de UNK .    3.4137856511992553
madam president , i want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five - year plan .    3.066201571318508
in setting very ambitious long - term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present .    4.251365412344212
that was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group , mr poettering , in his opening address .    3.69949553315753
the union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful european economy being in place .    3.2239595027261134
that foundation is clearly the single market .    3.5854529177214944
how strongly is the single market established at the moment ?    4.3857292333924445
i want to remind mr prodi , and his colleagues who are still here , of the findings of the commission ' s own survey among UNK european businesses .    3.936391334356845
nearly 40 % of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications .    3.1574498082205325
this is the commission ' s own survey .    3.2966018942875595
these are the classic symptoms of continued UNK by national governments - bureaucratic red - tape blocking market entry .    2.826343418520236
the commission ' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market .    2.5052260912339968
we have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensifying pressure on member states who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services .    3.417517117068871
only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved .    3.970579415545513
an enlarged europe must build on the existing strengths of the union .    3.349780682040727
the single market extending across that enlarged union is going to be a colossal achievement .    3.9997295896902214
i conclude by saying , on behalf of all my conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this parliament - that we pledge our full support to the commission and to mr prodi in achieving this historic task .    4.512967456488774
madam president , mr prodi , ladies and gentlemen , at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today .    3.5118838149873812
the serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme .    4.472359273836257
from your speech i will concentrate on what you have called the new governance , which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens .    3.7945516367245915
the UNK of the eu institutions , the responsibilities of the member states and the local and regional authorities is all very well .    3.584011519585183
yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and european construction ?    3.5519079614558082
is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about ' who does what ' but more ' what are we doing together ' ?    3.4236310517333455
it is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens .    3.0728597211983786
in your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us . i would add to these the future of our social model .    4.256049528182602
this is why i and my group are so firmly insisting on the charter of fundamental rights .    2.2937077081038058
the reason our timetable includes the drafting of this charter is because we are at a key point in our history . our union needs to redefine the values on which it is based , both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we UNK desire , but not under just any conditions .    3.7769603459429755
our people expect more europe , but not just any europe .    3.8569852122842114
they are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather , on the basis of our social model , to be able to organise globalisation .    4.030282281035007
in this respect i must say that , in terms of your commitment to a political union , to which we are favourable , this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model , on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world .    4.2960263679671264
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , i should like to start with a quote : " the commission will continue to work towards establishing a european charter of fundamental rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme .    3.6120459325667067
the commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine european policy on asylum and immigration . it wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime " .    4.125024742179254
that is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security , freedom , citizens ' rights and judicial cooperation .    3.858696907239608
a paper this short is a farce .    3.038485955953501
a farce because we know and appreciate the work of commissioner vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand .    4.090772856934848
a paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard .    3.7099312954605095
it has been UNK and UNK as a huge achievement and i am all for it ; we need a basis for a scoreboard .    4.4505913829842445
we here in parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme .    3.9279679644764447
we want instruments to prevent abuse .    3.1665752989260008
we want to develop a community immigration policy which takes account of the member states ' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of europol , for example , so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime .    4.644942558736051
madam president , mr president of the commission , commissioners , i rise to speak on the subject of the world trade organisation , on which there is a broad convergence of views between the commission documents and the positions of the socialist group . this is not the case in other areas , as has already been pointed out .    3.788134247557264
we share these views because we are in favour of world trade , but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards , common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind . this aim is that trade should benefit development , and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world ' s most dynamic and competitive regions .    4.321305167639538
on the other hand , what does this statement tell us about principles ?    2.9250927008652994
this regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the world trade organisation , in other words , increased wealth , but when we look at how this wealth is distributed , we see , unfortunately , that the gulf between the world ' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase .    3.663056400389675
it is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves , what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve ?    3.1184562666432676
what good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the world trade organisation works , if they cause trade to increase on the one hand , but on the other , they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow ?    3.844195632094482
that is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the commission outlined here for the seattle negotiations and for later ones .    4.071326570524629
we are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious .    4.074797702261974
we need to be demanding and ensure that social rights , environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations .    3.783608072641673
most importantly though , we must have a brave and ambitious long - term vision for reform , not just of the wto but also of the UNK , the united nations and above all , of the financial institutions , specifically the imf and the world bank .    4.928552352741337
we must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation . we must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process , so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly - developed blocks and countries , but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world .    4.1538498151269145
madam president , i would also like to welcome the commission ' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years , although i hope that it intends , in subsequent documents , to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today .    3.5263628676780465
having said this , madam president , i am prepared , once again , to be a voice crying in the UNK as a result of the absence of a fishing policy .    4.38099698486351
it is really surprising that the commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years , in view of the reform which must take place in 2002 .    4.449101384598748
there is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years .    3.728270119436985
however , it seems that the commission does not share this view , although it is the commission which is obliged to present the council and parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001 , and it is on this basis that the council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification .    5.3226334665359705
in fact , the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions , such as the european parliament , which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy .    3.427027694487564
we have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply .    3.9027495373706023
less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such UNK should be resolved within the framework of this reform process .    4.293910802515052
therefore , madam president , mr president of the commission , i would ask that this issue , which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the european union , be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years .    3.7488603566324383
madam president , i should like to add my congratulations to commissioner prodi ' s programme .    3.050337955958928
i particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth : the information society in an expanding european market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity , innovation enterprise , the entrepreneurial spirit and yes - most importantly of all - extra - high value sustainable jobs for our european citizens .    3.168059598936136
i have one observation , not a criticism , to make regarding commissioner prodi ' s statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy .    4.522699182453872
we must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the european economy UNK .    4.124412209264365
after all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?    3.730577155522328
full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens .    3.8668199706552437
this is a key priority for us to focus on .    3.928441375602627
i should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the commission which will help us : in particular commissioner liikanen ' s commitment to having an innovative knowledge - driven economy .    3.7880864072728184
yes , e - europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs .    4.198142299954418
i welcome the commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium - sized enterprises and i would like to congratulate our portuguese presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro - businesses .    3.444769200038741
that is important and something that can be developed through the lisbon summit .    3.30790480664245
i also welcome commissioner busquin ' s idea to have a common research area for the whole of the european union .    3.3907025585479436
again , this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity .    4.411628931889871
you said in your summary , commissioner prodi , that liberalisation , competitiveness , keeping inflation low , innovation , science and technology are central for the future success of the european economy and creating jobs .    3.6345491535845613
i very much agree with you on that , but we can take nothing for granted .    3.9541054778047244
there is still more we have to do , and the lisbon summit will become part of that .    4.825415497728538
so with those remarks i would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success .    4.1791463115260035
madam president , mr president of the commission , i should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme .    3.187097531104481
to me , this commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the european union or a declaration of principle .    4.2771694716779525
unfortunately , it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the commission .    3.6356883613172766
as the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group , i would have expected more in the way of agenda from an italian president of the commission .    3.8849179131992253
the commission gives no soul to europe .    2.7138052836864897
culture and training simply do not exist in this paper , despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in europe .    3.7856704602469375
just a few main points .    3.355452039902693
i am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture ; they create jobs .    3.6810427634143474
i am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas , about consolidating and improving the european dimension of training and education UNK and about networking training and education policies in europe especially lifelong learning .    3.38593688894555
nor was any mention made of information policy and communications UNK to the needs of our citizens .    3.759293236378937
it seems to me that something is missing from this programme .    2.800697870654103
truly european citizenship depends on our creating a real , visible area of training and culture .    3.2819859697602056
declarations of principle are not enough .    3.7062596274967827
we need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which i have just described .    4.28239115099373
madam president , mr prodi , how would you take stock of your policy and work programme , what would your benchmark be , if you had to make direct choices ?    3.43780334974749
you have the fine , charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five - year programme will be the result of the elections , or rather the turnout at the next european elections .    3.278658554934114
when i think that i have to explain your work programme week in , week out to my constituents , not in the UNK atmosphere of this house , but on the street , then i ask myself , what can i say ?    4.486294572328769
mr prodi , what can i say ; what is there that is new ?    3.242206605002829
there is nothing new in your work programme .    3.1116955009065803
you have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year ' s work programme .    3.3639404652577056
does that give me hope for the year 2000 ?    3.263464266836227
no , it does not !    4.027847110155737
in your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever .    3.2085428612583033
you say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas .    3.2725113533155032
have you done so , mr prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?    3.945910938115695
no , you have not done so .    3.6243593440584116
you have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement , despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement .    3.6645663405636553
nor have you integrated it into economic policy , competition or the internal market .    3.4676506548263393
you have not integrated it anywhere .    2.8552045823782697
you have UNK a few components together but you have no overall structure .    3.4123478871207795
you said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure ; no , mr prodi , we need , at long last , to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored .    4.081956615364542
you say in your five - year programme that the people of the european union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation .    3.566130447905894
mr prodi , you do not know what you are talking about .    3.7302780049897284
the foodstuffs legislation in the european union is the most ambitious in the world .    4.196700775736871
where it falls short , what is missing , is transposition in the member states and monitoring .    4.1964629140201275
it is time you took your job seriously , it is time for you , as president of the commission , to box the member states on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties .    4.055762461920256
it is no good spending time on UNK when there is a day ' s work to be done .    3.7715490511737477
that is what we expect of you in the next five years .    3.2903169746636807
.    2.4274255028413507
( es ) madam president , mr president of the commission , as chairman of this parliament ' s committee on fisheries , mr prodi , you are not making things easy for me at all .    3.811672956019404
i feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us .    3.681447203318988
the next five years of the prodi commission - as you UNK announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change .    3.944740682212823
i hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing , since the silence of your programme , with regard to fishing , is deafening .    3.8913183358909285
not a single line , nor a single word , refers to fishing or the cfp .    3.014842372055559
i am not asking for details or specific points , but i believe that a mention was required .    3.581531471046301
how could you completely ignore a common - i repeat ; common - policy with such an economic , social and regional impact , and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of europe ?    3.748744780849284
does the commission intend to do nothing - at least it has announced nothing - about this reform in 2000 either ?    3.11789277267532
what message can we send to the fishermen of europe , and their families , and the fishing industries , both the UNK and processing and marketing industries , and the related and secondary industries which depend on fishing in so many european ports , in so many european regions , in most cases peripheral regions , who rightly demand that this problem be dealt with as a priority ?    4.457787883832613
you have made an explicit reference to the cap for the coming years , but you have not done so for the cfp , with regard to the double adaptation of the internal market which is necessary to prevent exceptions - as has already been said - and in a global context , in the context of globalisation .    4.427791702898387
this house has expressed its opinion on the first issue and it will also do so on the second .    4.695605076654763
our parliamentary group will table an amendment in this respect and we expect a positive message from you .    4.030898194537755
mr president of the commission , this is indeed an historic moment for parliament , a five - year programme following the crisis of the commission .    3.676247548886314
on behalf of the socialist group , i would like to focus on the point of internal reform .    3.6721594919829017
we wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of vice - president , mr kinnock , on behalf of the commission .    4.367153417510106
we consider it to be of utmost importance that , in terms of financial control , personnel management and bureaucratic short - cuts , we can expect swift lines of policy and a more effective bureaucracy , for the benefit of the citizen .    4.027573947738268
at the same time , we are aware that this is a massive programme and that , during the overhaul in the next couple of years , it will be necessary to keep the actual results coming in , as before .    4.046829812670592
much like in the netherlands , where , at a given point , women UNK up to the fact that , by referring to european legislation , they could improve their status in terms of social security , this is now also the case for scores of other citizens .    4.980816093496361
they want to see results .    3.691842708013623
democracy , transparency and clarity always lead to results , citizens value results and this is what the commission is judged on .    4.350161633502394
this is exactly the point which mr swoboda and also other members made : fear of modernisation , globalisation , and the individual losing his own sense of safety and security .    3.647085899226677
i would therefore strongly advocate internal reform which delivers fast and concrete results at a social level . this gives the citizen a sense of recognition , here in europe and elsewhere .    3.4906514628640384
because this citizen - one in five globally - still has no access to elementary social provisions , such as education and health care .    3.26561515351788
these are really the people who deserve our solidarity .    3.8401270483765395
madam president , mr president of the commission , i have read and re - read the commission ' s document setting out the strategic objectives for its term in office .    3.6288385629527236
i am delighted that it is being discussed in parliament , but i also note the compromises and the omissions in it .    4.338378609562055
the commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between member states and to the european union ' s regional policy .    3.494263668782751
are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?    3.9582129342864865
certainly not !    3.3701938436233436
at the same time , it was rightly pointed out that europe must evaluate its role as a joint partner with developing countries , and strengthen its activities designed for fighting poverty .    3.325983387079808
this document leaves out issues which clearly should have been included .    3.6964411908568358
i think the fact that the commission does not address the issue of cohesion is extremely serious .    4.026798029385198
it plays down one of the treaties ' principles - that of economic and social cohesion - which must inform all of the european institutions ' policies and measures . it seems to ignore the fact that various european regions are still considerably less advanced than others .    4.760567173308579
it also UNK that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right . unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the european union itself will be at risk .    3.8497052262545544
we should take into consideration the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions in the european union , for which the commission is responsible .    4.864274214760038
this report confirms that whereas an average level of development is given a rating of 100 , the ten so - called " strongest " regions reached an average of 158 , and the ten so - called " weakest " regions reached a figure of around 50 .    3.207345607333709
you may draw your own conclusions .    3.2039570854134696
50 is exactly the level of development of my own region , the azores , one of the regions defined in the treaties as ultra - peripheral .    4.492761983984664
i am waiting for the commission ' s report on the ultra - peripheral regions , which the council decided should be drawn up by december 1999 .    4.152040430950672
i shall finish by restating my conviction that without economic and social cohesion , there will be no cohesion at all , only UNK .    3.4702991195170663
madam president , mr prodi , europe needs a strong commission .    3.0778440870093102
as intended by the treaties and the will of the people , the commission is the driving force of european construction which is like a UNK of UNK which we have to push back up to the summit again together after each round of enlargement . we therefore need a strong commission but one which relies on the support of a parliament .    4.552345197386874
this house is therefore your ally but not one which is too accommodating . you must therefore listen to our opinions , one or two of which i wish to express in my brief speech .    3.542093509505962
firstly , mr president , although your two predecessors concentrated on developing an internal market and establishing the single currency , it has been left to you to develop this whole value of citizenship which is at the heart of european construction .    4.029561476205121
you must not allow yourself to be UNK by the sole issue of enlargement , however important this may be .    4.289713440317366
you must go further , towards reconciling the people with europe , in particular those people who are falling victim to economic , social and , probably , in the future , technological divisions .    4.304598906546549
the promotion of scientific development and new technologies and access for all to these technologies will not be provided by the market or competition . the latter will also not ensure the social proximity and effectiveness of the main community services of health , education , transport , communications , water and whatever else .    4.149083903080147
your action programme and your objectives are reserved , even silent , specifically on the stimulation of public investment which is needed .    3.2169895794667482
this is also the case with the consolidation and financing of the main public and general interest services .    3.258527063929631
this is an absolute priority if you are to reconcile europe with the people and ensure that the people choose europe rather than jörg haider .    3.849808954050602
madam president , the commission was correct to make food safety one of its top priorities .    3.3925380062085915
the recent dioxin scare in belgium , prior to that the bse crisis in britain , and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically - modified UNK , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat .    3.8192593054023405
if the commission can indeed restore confidence in the food production chain it will simultaneously restore confidence in the european union institutions themselves and demonstrate their ability to protect the rights of eu citizens .    3.818264795703686
i therefore welcome the fact that the issue of food safety , public health and consumer confidence features prominently in the commission ' s work programme for 2000 .    3.8275818027053687
however , i was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a european food authority in the recent white paper .    4.084458146285921
in its present form , what is being proposed is more like an advisory agency to the commission rather than an independent body that would have decision - and law - making powers more similar to those of the us food and drug administration , which has already established credibility in this particular field .    3.9553661162598432
furthermore , future legislation must address the modus operandi of the relationship between the european food authority and the authorities of national member states , for example the food safety authority in ireland .    3.903778317626718
this body , for example , alongside the recently established cross - border body in ireland for food safety , is already doing good work .    3.824291097150972
it would be a tragedy if their efforts were to be undermined by deficiencies in eu legislation .    3.0271021157273026
my fear is that such deficiencies in eu legislation could lead to UNK wars between national and eu bodies , who should be working together rather than against one another .    3.0387787226531535
that is something we must guard against .    2.8944880114689906
madam president , the presentation by president prodi today has necessarily been a fairly broad brush affair .    2.9138419631391126
we will be looking for the detail year by year , for example in the social action programme to be UNK this year .    3.9956520758968472
we will also be looking at this from the perspective of social and employment policy , and will be applying a number of tests .    4.798883802587206
we will be looking at the extent to which we can create an UNK policy UNK combining economic policy , employment policy and social policy .    3.3155091910226075
at the moment , social policy is trailing well behind economic and employment policy .    3.134704920399073
within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the portuguese presidency .    3.9113558710466987
within the social dimension we will be looking for a deepening of the internal market with a social aspect .    4.127087909735551
the UNK of mergers , UNK and transfers that we are experiencing with the deepening of the market means that we must act to update the UNK of information and consultation directives that we have adopted in the past ; but we must also complement them with the new general framework of information and consultation and an updating of the works council directive .    5.104773944721986
we also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change .    3.5848437430166444
that is the successful way to manage change , and i hope the commission will act to make sure that is put into place .    4.344590432382651
finally , with the emergence , the resurgence , of the xenophobic right within the european union i hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to article 6 by using article 13 to combat discrimination , and article UNK to combat exclusion .    4.038207506265629
we need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now .    2.9518768260464388
the aspirations are fine , president prodi , we want those aspirations to be matched by action .    3.7041774535453755
madam president , i hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i ' s left for me to UNK .    4.042555533296991
mr prodi , you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward - looking employment policy throughout europe .    2.763855706112117
however , for the economic sector which i represent , i . e . fisheries , this means change .    4.306054665155493
we must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry .    3.038255870055747
what it comes down to is the competitiveness of the european economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing .    3.9254886992304527
however , i am sure that i do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor , which affects not only germany but all the coastal regions of europe .    3.6870417270280504
plus , this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act , which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too .    4.116707600671051
this has since been unanimously approved .    3.1935835908661856
the fisheries policy is due for review in a few months ' time , i . e . at the beginning of the year 2000 .    3.789492923727536
so it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper .    3.933467377742829
i hope that this is a misunderstanding .    3.519690708754004
please , mr prodi , stand by your word and implement your promises .    3.5373922142666117
madam president , many of the speakers from the socialist group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the commission ' s statement .    3.9749596120705832
however , we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the commission .    4.136386099960002
one area that i want to focus on , in addition to those already identified , is that of cultural diversity in europe .    4.686715294286489
the introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important .    4.15302117663544
but there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity .    4.087981573043405
if we are to ensure that we defeat the fear - UNK amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other , both within the present european union and among those who seek to join us and , indeed , among those in other parts of europe and the world who want to come and live and work in europe .    3.920758931828638
unless we address these issues , unless we dismantle these negative stereotypes , unless we take what is best from our various cultures and languages and protect and expand it and ensure that we are serious about having a diverse europe , we will fail .    3.697927448382705
those who are currently coming to the fore in europe based on fear will win the day .    3.525295425975995
if we do not take steps to deal with that , we will fail ultimately .    4.61266856914552
thank you , mr de UNK .    2.657309547220825
before giving the floor again to the president of the commission , i must tell you that i have received , pursuant to rule 37 , seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate .    3.912938008807207
welcome    3.743268227627731
i would like to inform you that there is a delegation from UNK , led by his UNK , sheikh UNK al - UNK , vice - prime minister and defence minister , here in the official gallery .    3.9670861616090773
on behalf of the house , i would like to welcome you to the european parliament .    4.158449539195617
i understand that on 26 january the association wrote to the college of quaestors requesting permission to set up a table outside the hemicycle today to publicise their initiative .    2.9260952472466015
on the same day , i understand , mr balfe gave permission for the assistants to go ahead .    3.5389663627912897
the parliament services asked to meet with the assistants yesterday to make the necessary physical arrangements .    3.589244620304813
however , the appointment was cancelled at the last minute .    3.071896360845879
parliament has not yet indicated why permission was withdrawn .    3.071208591219062
mrs banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why permission was withdrawn but so far no letter has been received .    2.8042530467464277
can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute ?    3.5077482750864872
do you agree that the assistants have a legitimate case which must be heard ?    3.820829275283754
will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last - minute UNK do not happen again ?    2.9660680013522565
will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible ?    3.0372878867536905
finally , will you make sure that in the meantime parliament ' s rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid , as they should be , on the basis of all the work they do for us ?    5.237713460070444
without them we would not be able to function .    4.673951651888623
mr president , i also rise on a point of order .    2.513059428984841
are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this parliament , outside the doors of the hemicycle , to ensure that meps are free to come into this hemicycle to discharge their mandate ?    3.5337753069872173
if there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?    3.746391856818788
mr president , i would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants , which we have always considered to be a priority , and inform you that - as the italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader , mr barón crespo , we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the quaestors .    4.143792743219321
i think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway .    3.86704128681799
i would therefore like to call on the presidency of parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the presidency itself to invite the members to do likewise .    3.647571825265563
mr president , first of all let me say that i am in full support of a statute for assistants .    3.4257297605456465
yesterday when i arrived in parliament i was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of parliament .    3.088728476889685
as all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are UNK first of all through the comart committee of parliament .    3.871535204804435
to give a non - contentious example , no commercial exhibitions can be held here in parliament for obvious reasons .    3.5163287318333247
following a letter i received yesterday , i immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration , probably in the near future and possibly in the next month .    3.812217751118562
but all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of parliament .    3.29936102687394
i signed a letter yesterday afternoon , in the meeting of the bureau of parliament , in which the assistants were informed of this .    4.87186773164231
but i am also told that they were informed UNK of this decision by the committee of chairmen of groups last thursday , so they were fully aware of the decision .    4.183057401334348
there is no problem with them telling us the way they feel , there is no problem with a possible meeting during parliament ' s next part - session .    3.6090782200747378
but there was some misunderstanding , for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission .    3.151405682818769
but all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so - called comart committee .    3.2014372592715405
this is not an attempt to either UNK or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants .    3.6543954698870618
thank you , mrs banotti .    2.8120900810400884
i think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised .    3.1429343653815307
mr president , i wanted to point out an important matter of principle .    3.51599115619619
we shall now proceed to the vote . 1    2.6912514148936073
vote    3.0905809937555753
mr president , i am speaking on behalf of the spanish delegation of the european people ' s party , the delegation of the spanish people ' s party , with regard to mrs terrón i cusí ' s resolution on the area of freedom , security and justice .    2.974868215089457
there have been some votes where we have not followed the guidelines of the group of the european people ' s party , and we have voted in favour of the terrón i cusí resolution , which we consider on the whole to be excellent .    4.001530454765748
however , we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect .    3.596502748490884
on the other hand , we have voted in favour of recital UNK which , in fact , is in line with what i , as draftsperson of the opinion of the committee on citizens ' freedoms , proposed to that committee , with a view to the intergovernmental conference .    3.3714263090849954
we have also voted in favour of paragraph 13 .    2.9138800687178312
an appropriate statute and the right of movement and settlement for residents of non - eu countries is something which the spanish people ' s party has been advocating for some time .    3.902963716090511
for similar reasons , we have voted in favour of paragraph 14 which , with the oral amendment , dealt with certain very justifiable concerns about the question of subsidiarity , since political rights , not just voting in local elections , but political rights in general terms , form part of the sovereignty of member states .    4.308783651384063
given the oral amendment , we felt we could vote in favour and that is what we have done .    4.560995941922181
.    2.4274255028413507
( da ) the danish social democratic members of the european parliament have chosen to vote in favour of the proposed resolution , but are at the same time aware of the fact that certain areas clash with the reservation denmark has in the legal sphere - a reservation which the danish delegation in the group of the party of european socialists naturally wishes to respect .    3.573757339887654
this report which i voted against is less concerned with human rights than with ' communitisation ' or the consolidation of fortress europe .    3.3402317093844567
the supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the dublin conventions and schengen agreements and a further action plan from tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants .    3.25770680463719
in terms of human rights , this is a backward step .    4.934792126583175
europe is continuing to expel nationals arriving from countries regarded as dangerous by the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees . yet some applicant countries in central and eastern europe are taking in UNK refugees expelled en masse from belgium .    3.162409425288261
kosovo albanians and serb UNK are being refused refugee status , whereas pinochet is calmly UNK prosecution .    2.981379809262445
the europe of schengen clearly finds it much easier to UNK the persecuted from the south than dictators , even though the un estimates that we will need UNK million immigrants to maintain a stable population between now and the year 2025 .    3.651807712292839
europe should UNK the situation of all its illegal immigrants and grant them right of asylum and the right to vote in all elections . only then can we talk in this house about an area of freedom and justice .    3.9411456065719874
mccarthy report ( a5 - 0026 / 2000 )    4.25000928366466
mr president , i would firstly like to point out that i was mayor of bilbao during the nineties , which gave me the opportunity to present one of the first urban pilot projects to be subsidised by the commission .    3.121626290140181
our experience with that pilot project in bilbao led us to four conclusions : firstly , that europe must maintain an urban policy and therefore , far from reducing the eur 900 million for the last five year period to eur 700 million for this five year period , the funding of this project should be increased . this should be done , for example - and the group of the greens / european free alliance has proposed this - by UNK , in urban projects , that portion of the structural funds which each member state has not spent within the time scales laid down for that purpose .    3.774989413961198
secondly , when deciding which areas must be subsidised , we must concentrate efforts on integrated projects .    3.4592644354759985
disparate actions are not effective .    3.840023240902683
we have to select locations by prioritising those which are most impoverished and needy , in accordance with the objectives set , that is to say , the social , economic , environmental and democratic management dimensions , as well as the relationship between them .    3.810560903894419
thirdly , we have to bear in mind the synergies generated by other community programmes , as well as the opportunities for sustainable development in the location or region in question .    3.4459849133902183
finally , we have to put our trust in , and support , the institutions which are closest to the citizens , that is , the local councils and bodies .    4.125861017915935
they have more first - hand knowledge of social needs . they have more involvement in the problems and , furthermore , they know how to conceive projects and implement them effectively without weighing them down with bureaucracy , and thereby achieve better results .    3.4488129013570736
this has obliged us to abstain from the final vote , because we do not understand how we can ignore the environmental question when deciding which projects must be financed and we do not understand how we can reject the idea that each member state can dedicate , to urban projects , that portion of the structural funds which it has not spent in accordance with community programmes .    3.8269165845731687
mr president , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism had an in - depth discussion on the urban initiative which produced many ideas .    2.734090351776616
as the smallest community initiative in existence , we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected .    3.700442929319682
we regret this as there was actually money left over from the structural funds in some countries which could really have helped with pilot projects . we should remember that it is these urban projects which specifically allow a truly urban policy to be established .    3.9941767664276537
the commission should also pay attention to coherence between the various policies which are in place . it should make urban projects coherent with future projects in budget lines entitled ' sustainable urban policy ' .    3.603817776578302
finally , there is currently still no european urban policy within the european union . perhaps this point could be developed in the context of reorganisation and the intergovernmental conference so that the european union finally has a true urban policy .    4.274429634767583
mr president , i would like to point out that i voted for this report on sustainable urban development , known as urban .    2.9455343288557505
as with all other community initiatives , this is very positive .    4.3902559076013565
europe is making its presence felt at a time when we are doing something for all the citizens of europe and not simply for the development of an individual state , UNK one it may be .    4.136879512017356
urban is designed to find solutions to urban UNK , and this is something of great concern to the elderly and therefore of great concern to the pensioners ' party .    4.016055223249667
there can be no worse situation than that of an elderly person living in a city .    2.9738589029415303
i hope that this community initiative will help serve as an example on how to resolve the problems faced by the elderly in cities .    3.2482143655768625
. ( da ) the left ' s five members of the european parliament have chosen to support leader + , the equal initiative and interreg , but not urban .    3.3502690945229068
at a forthcoming review of these programmes , it ought to be established that the eu ' s efforts are to be concentrated upon cross - border tasks and adapted to the possible enlargement of the eu .    4.468635840728134
. ( da ) we have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the commission concerning the guidelines for a community initiative relating to the economic and social regeneration of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis and designed to promote sustainable development ( urban ) .    2.85102997352201
basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations , as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects .    3.4474845046044447
this report contains general points on what is referred to as the urban regeneration strategy for town centres and neighbourhoods affected by the crisis in the capitalist economy and its consequences , i . e . increasing unemployment , exclusion and delinquency .    3.1369576631525833
it underlines the fact that , in order to ensure sustainable urban development , an urban policy must be implemented which does not leave out the main victims of the economic crisis , namely the unemployed , immigrants , refugees , women and the socially excluded .    3.924591200103889
however , nothing is said about the causes of this crisis and those responsible for it .    3.735241639866894
at best this report simply UNK certain aspects and effects of the crisis . yet only UNK limited resources are available for this work .    3.523100475140871
as the report itself indicates , the funds allocated to the urban ii programme for the 2000 - 2006 period are approximately 30 % less than those in the previous period , which were already low , at eur 900 million . added to this is the fact that only about fifty projects are considered for the whole of europe which is pathetic when practically all european city districts , both UNK and inner city , are affected .    3.7735555502927993
this is why we will vote individually in favour of the specific measures planned to help certain social categories which are most disadvantaged but will abstain on the report itself in order to denounce the fact that in the main it consists of pious hopes financed on the cheap .    3.8276657097806654
- ( fr ) mrs mccarthy , ladies and gentlemen , i am very pleased that the urban community initiative is being continued as this aims to support the social and economic conversion of cities and neighbourhoods in crisis , all with a view to achieving sustainable urban development .    3.0957459371843785
with some 80 % of the population of europe living in an urban area , cities are at the forefront of economic , social and cultural change in europe .    3.3725302258513086
at the same time , the social and economic problems facing european society are more pronounced in urban areas .    2.9366218160587265
many european cities are divided into neighbourhoods characterised by high - added - value activities and high - income residents and other districts characterised by low incomes , high unemployment , UNK and overcrowded housing and high levels of welfare dependency .    3.092729410650659
the concentration of economic and social problems in certain urban areas calls for targeted intervention taking full account of the complexity of the problems involved .    3.8729629076880725
this is why the european parliament successfully called for the urban community initiative or cip to be extended during the reform of the structural funds .    3.3888631584491433
the success of urban during the 1994 - 1999 programming period is UNK .    3.0470374305265846
the results are clear in terms of the improvement of the quality of life in the target areas .    3.8677621459725002
this cip has encouraged the development of best practice models in the economic , social and environmental sectors .    3.6491591501465255
it has also had the distinction of strengthening the role of local authorities , the non - governmental sector and local communities and of supporting new partnership approaches to urban regeneration .    3.4305247251731026
the new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them , while particularly promoting equal opportunities between men and women and integrating socially marginalised and disadvantaged groups .    3.1488633163270494
we can therefore welcome its adoption .    2.946295428223122
the total appropriation allocated is not up to the challenge .    3.6545624729553086
the amount for the 1994 - 1999 period was eur 900 million and will be eur 700 million for the 2000 - 2006 period . this represents a drop of 30 % !    3.14613169477759
this reduction in funding has led to a reduction in the number of programmes in the new urban initiative .    4.374605748700596
the chosen threshold of 50 projects seems too low .    3.0689693874597213
it needs to be increased to reflect regional and local factors whilst maintaining financial awards to the member states .    3.607614856526432
in view of this concentration on a limited number of projects , the publication and dissemination of the results of the new urban community initiative will perhaps be particularly important to achieve a multiplier effect .    3.5788618666739813
the mccarthy report on the urban community initiative gives us an opportunity to reflect on the appropriateness of community intervention in urban matters .    3.8805701231866427
the situation of certain urban areas is alarming , with the social distress taking the form of unemployment , misery and crime .    3.819488417212031
drug dealing in particular fuels insecurity and delinquency .    3.2486664719045977
faced with these social challenges , the effectiveness of the structural funds is still in doubt .    3.710091913721539
subsidiarity should make us realise that the state , exercising its governing functions , and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately . the state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people .    3.6772527822578724
although we welcome the determination to create a system of exchanges between successful enterprises , the problems specific to each urban area cannot be dealt with in the same way .    3.5336028045741696
the urban community initiative is helping to achieve the european union ' s desire to UNK urban policy .    3.9165560499064713
it would be more appropriate for the eu to concentrate its financial efforts on pre - existing european policies .    3.5062839999670494
clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget UNK race which is particularly UNK when the convergence criteria for emu are imposing a very strict UNK regime on the national budgets .    3.282011198134038
mrs mccarthy is therefore suggesting an increase in the funds allocated to urban and the promotion of this community initiative through a costly communication campaign UNK the benefits of a federal europe .    3.5857274464631033
we should remember that the effectiveness of expenditure is not measured by the volume of funding allocated to the project .    3.2433310326590696
in fact , the beneficiaries of too many and too high subsidies will eventually just take these for granted .    2.811717357763901
the aim must not be to help the people but to make them take responsibility .    4.213443610503218
finally , the report specifically highlights actions in favour of ethnic or UNK minorities .    4.115507149229867
we can only condemn a policy on minorities which is inevitably dangerous for social cohesion .    3.0989241020112193
on one hand , this policy encourages the integration of immigrants where it should favour their UNK into the culture of the host country . this would prevent the development of ethnic ghettos which are nothing more than urban powder UNK .    3.6569552511128443
on the other hand , it UNK the principle of positive discrimination . this is a politically correct UNK which can be just as harmful , as shown by the us precedent .    4.170540674878575
for all these reasons , the french delegation of the uen group could not approve the mccarthy report .    3.0261466589098784
decourrière report ( a5 - 0028 / 2000 )    4.068867070312322
like many of my colleagues , i am pleased that the european parliament was able to safeguard this initiative .    4.41279186395544
these projects must therefore be properly taken into account and must integrate sustainable development .    3.529369998232919
why am i stressing this point ?    3.4401865240326304
the answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted .    4.019212137686874
for example , to accept new roads is to accept new pollution within the european union . this goes totally against the policies which we are proposing to fight greenhouse gas emissions , for example .    3.6418986220490095
i would also ask the commission to ensure that the environmental pillar of the eu ' s policy is integrated into the projects submitted and that the goal of reducing co2 for example forms an experimental added value in the projects proposed .    3.565535130118601
i am particularly thinking in this respect of certain infrastructures which are under construction .    3.830806288633898
however , i am also thinking of my own region where my government is still debating whether to route the railway or to build a second motorway , the UNK .    3.430981483131435
in this respect too , i would ask the commission to be particularly attentive about ensuring that there is real cohesion between the various policies , specifically in the interreg programmes which are being submitted .    4.29961396051136
mr president , i voted for the decourrière report on the community initiative interreg , mainly because of the reply commissioner barnier gave to some members who took the floor and asked for this programme to make greater reference to border regions with maritime frontiers . i voted for it , not just because i was born in a coastal town , UNK , but above all because the frontiers of regions UNK by the sea are frontiers too .    3.6005430793768083
these frontiers stretch as far as african states and the middle east : we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of europe .    4.489732945341916
as an mep from a border region , i welcome this third interreg initiative with great interest .    3.8705147332460617
we can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically , socially and culturally .    3.495600203715824
due to the existence of these borders , they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong . this has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy .    4.080119458092664
this is why the interreg community initiative was launched in 1990 .    2.770061074038922
this programme was designed to encourage cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the union .    3.5894287947006425
interreg serves principally to fund community schemes to develop smes , education and training , cultural exchanges , action to combat health problems , the protection and improvement of the environment , energy , transport and telecommunications networks .    3.924138508781942
i must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of european integration .    3.1555255573098435
more active participation by these authorities in community initiatives should be promoted , bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border .    3.921579019868588
in cross - border cooperation , greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium - sized undertakings which are the job creators .    3.575774107970795
in the same respect , given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50 % of all unemployment , the interreg funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment .    3.927053124695758
obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing , UNK or hindering cross - border mobility .    3.5254627875440305
i hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region !    4.203301829067076
interreg resources must also contribute to the development of a european research area .    3.800426040593014
finally , and in particular , expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through interreg !    3.248252524222213
the challenges are therefore immense . the integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future european regional development policy !    4.181661955154686
i hope everyone , like mr decourrière , whom i congratulate , will realise this !    3.391746428589483
this apparently generous policy , officially intended to help problem regions , is a UNK ' s bargain for french taxpayers .    3.8751832838294256
france contributes 17 % of the european budget yet will receive only 8 % of the regional structural funds .    4.837494921107119
between 1994 and 1999 , our regions annually received an average of ff 15 . 4 billion but will receive only ff 14 . 7 billion between 2000 and 2006 .    3.0366756017266576
my region of UNK - pas - de - calais will be particularly affected with french UNK losing the aid paid to objective 1 regions .    3.2201540041856345
this loss is unjustified in a region whose main activities have been ruined by free - trade europe .    3.184194121823603
the european regional policy also reinforces the UNK of brussels with which the regional authorities are invited to negotiate directly on the use of the structural funds .    3.950725861751015
this is a europe of regions in which the regions , which are weaker than the nation states , will easily submit to brussels .    4.501074903325727
however , mr decourrière does show some common sense by denouncing the failings of the brussels technocrats .    2.763746471804437
these failings will result in particular in the late implementation of interreg iii and therefore in financial losses for the regions in receipt of aid .    3.605405115428486
we also agree with the rapporteur about asking for more attention to be paid to small and medium - sized undertakings and , of course , about refusing to use outside service providers .    3.321309862199268
these are the procedures which caused the corruption scandal in the previous commission .    2.992899037174237
however , these isolated elements which make sense and for which we voted , in no way remedy the eurofederalist philosophy which characterises the community initiatives , particularly interreg .    3.314289117527075
this is why the national front voted against the report .    2.938254217710815
the european parliament has delivered an opinion on the commission guidelines for the interreg community initiative concerning cross - border , transnational and interregional cooperation .    3.203982438972869
i want to defend an amendment tabled by my group on the maritime aspect of this community initiative .    3.3957283001150707
this does not involve the concerns about the future of the atlantic UNK but rather the need to integrate the principle of maritime borders into strand a on cross - border cooperation .    4.103756476018765
in the commission guidelines , few maritime areas are eligible for interreg iiia . the amendments to the decourrière report aim to make interreg more maritime - oriented .    3.308642154765886
this is an important development which must be supported as it is the future of the eu which is at stake .    5.0897578558447805
i am aware of the commission ' s reluctance on this subject as it announced during the UNK on the presentation of interreg iii last november .    4.262128270773448
however , i must point out that preventing the recognition of maritime borders amounts to denying the existence of an area which has great potential for projects and innovation .    3.4800815812502077
one example of this is the ' celtic ' area which encompasses the territories of brittany in france , UNK and UNK in the united kingdom and cork and UNK in ireland . this is an area whose locally - based economy is characterised by dependence on the fishing industry and the importance of the agri - foodstuffs sector .    4.229684586546907
it also has excellent cultural and UNK links , through UNK for example . interreg iii , strand a , would allow the regions in this area to advance a number of structural projects needed to develop small and medium - sized undertakings and to promote research and technical development through knowledge transfer .    3.7807039803753097
the european commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions .    3.5592863199829035
this policy would have important economic consequences for the fishing industry in brittany in that catches could be UNK at irish advance bases in order to then be transported to the breton agri - foodstuffs industry .    3.359080035105943
the integration of the maritime border into strand a would finally allow the western periphery to be recognised as a unique and important economic area which is confronted by the ' UNK ' of the european union .    3.407728834849186
this would show respect for these peripheral areas which are rather concerned about enlargement to the east .    3.2050385499219445
the maritime world has great potential .    3.180805558827594
we therefore must not leave it out of innovative and pilot community programmes which will allow the new geographical and economic map of europe to be defined .    3.5106790090729514
. ( da ) the european project began as a partnership between states .    2.9286947336097224
this partnership has ensured peace and stability in our part of europe for over 50 years .    3.714289173813621
as a result of the economic and political success in our part of the world , of which the eu is just one proof , and in view of the ever greater proliferation of our western values , competition on the world market has grown considerably within the last few decades .    4.580429516428101
we can only do that by intensifying co - operation within the community .    3.197587093104253
it should not be about greater integration of the eu countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders .    3.863657585089274
a programme such as interreg is there precisely to support regional development projects across national borders , projects which make it possible to build centres of economic growth at european level which will be able to take up the challenge from our competitors on a global scale .    3.8685502674382377
i therefore welcome the continuation of the programme .    3.1178699667334633
. ( fr ) mr decourrière ' s report is not without merit : at the end of a clear and comprehensive presentation of the interreg initiative and its role in opening up border regions , it comes out in favour of smes in paragraph 16 .    3.946952460517714
i and my colleague dominique souchet , who is well versed in this matter , have tabled five amendments highlighting the role of smes and craft trades within the framework of interreg , the importance of cooperation between undertakings and the need to involve economic and social partners in the design and implementation of the programmes and i welcome the fact that these amendments were adopted unanimously .    4.617337223309763
nonetheless , the french delegation in our group was unable to accept the fact that the commission and the federalist UNK have diverted the interreg initiative from its original purpose in order to detract still further from the political role of the nations .    3.9649302771798696
we have no intention of giving brussels the job of regulating regional planning in the member states , as suggested in recital of the report .    3.6456876155348987
we only ask one thing of the commission : that it confine itself to ensuring that the implementation of joint policies does not upset the balance of regional planning in our territories .    4.032459014670454
the destructive effects of the cap and emu on the balance between regions , especially on the UNK of the more rural , the more remote and the least populated regions , is proof positive of the fact that such ambitions are not a UNK , far from it .    4.648833502835927
we are therefore unable to approve the development of strand iiic of the community initiative encouraging interregional cooperation under the responsibility of the commission and UNK the member states .    4.083387060503541
this UNK with strand iiic is all the stranger in that the rapporteur himself acknowledges in his explanatory statement that ' the draft guidelines do not provide any indication of possible fields of co - operation ' ( p . 17 ) and that ' the responsibilities are UNK and vague ' ( p . 18 ) .    3.4331500006324083
calling under these circumstances , as he does in paragraph 20 , for the budget for this strand to be increased is another example of the irresponsible and ideological UNK tactics which are customary in this house .    3.89881572093145
lastly , there is the desire expressed both in the commission document and mr decourrière ' s report of using interreg for peace and reconstruction in the balkans : i do not think that the structural funds should be used to repair the damage which the americans UNK on serbia during bombardments which were as criminal as they were ineffectual .    4.161036956304952
it is up to washington , not us , to assume responsibility for a conflict which was UNK merely to serve its interests .    3.12206255520621
the french delegation in our group is therefore unable to support the decourrière report and will choose to abstain during the final vote .    3.3215767516201105
procacci report ( a5 - 0025 / 2000 )    3.3904673946971493
mr president , i voted for the procacci report on rural development , not only because i endorse the major policy lines of the leader programme , but also because it complements the urban programme , which i spoke about earlier .    3.71973337815369
just as elderly people in cities are very isolated , so the elderly are fast becoming the sole inhabitants of rural areas because young people are moving to the cities : they are drawn by the UNK lights , and the pubs , and the countryside and rural areas are being emptied .    4.05275953436889
i therefore believe that it is very important for everyone to back this european union plan and for it to be further developed .    3.6685857635280645
- ( pt ) although this community initiative , leader + , follows on from previous initiatives , it has some unique features .    3.679638409781832
one of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period .    3.2345739143084447
nevertheless , new objectives have been included , specifically the financing of the nature network 2000 , for which all rural regions will be eligible .    3.9341955547518492
in spite of the fact that this community initiative is aimed at rural development , it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this is unacceptable .    4.240796565372196
without agriculture , the rural world will disappear .    3.589775005359076
this means that any strategy for rural development must be based on agriculture ' s internal potential while at the same time developing as many other activities as possible in order to prevent the desertification of the rural world .    3.470140091098436
this is why we considered it essential to improve the report by means of our proposals deliberately to include agricultural activity and farmers in the strategy for rural development and to request more appropriations in order not to threaten the survival of the programme in those rural regions which were covered before . we also want to ensure that the new programme continues to prioritise the less - favoured regions .    3.7754307231673896
our position on leader is a product of our more general assessment of the eu ' s overall agricultural policy .    4.032091595204482
both leader 1 and leader 2 , which were implemented in the 1990s , were ingredients of the new cap that emerged after its review in 1992 and , along with other respective measures , they constituted the so - termed second pillar of the eu ' s rural development policy .    3.4910722666997485
their real aim was to moderate and disguise the new cap ' s disastrous consequences and the UNK of small and medium - scale farmers , and not to develop the rural areas or retain the agricultural population therein as was hypocritically declared in their objectives .    3.3523935567327037
this is proved by the fact that in the areas where those initiatives were implemented , farming incomes and employment decreased rapidly , which resulted in their depopulation .    3.7334264101341703
a characteristic example is greece , which as an objective 1 country was included as a whole in the leader community initiatives , and where the average annual reduction in employment in the farming sector reached approximately 2 . 3 % , while between 1994 and 1999 farming incomes decreased by 15 . 2 % .    3.550082770708564
we think leader + will be even more ineffectual than leader 1 and leader 2 , for the following reasons .    3.1391630984819434
the real aims of leader + are the same as those of leaders 1 and 2 , in other words to moderate and disguise the negative consequences of the cap to be implemented in the context of agenda 2000 and the wto .    3.7929211649928347
the present cap , however , is worse than its predecessor and it also starts from a worse basis , granted that the 1992 cap review and the gatt agreement in 1995 have created serious problems and UNK for the agricultural economy .    3.5777241428045294
the selection criteria and the activities that are subsidised under leader do , in the best case , moderate some partial problems of the countryside , which are of secondary importance , but in the worst case they degenerate into expenditure for the sake of public relations and pandering to conscience .    4.003456220016041
in no case , however , are they programmes for the integrated development of the selected areas and they do not create permanent jobs in the countryside because most of the activities there are not productive in nature .    4.25787369802883
the actual appropriations available for leader + compared with leader 2 are smaller despite their increase by 15 % ( from eur 1 UNK million for leader 2 to eur 2 020 million for leader + ) .    2.92739522512031
this is because the 15 % increase is nominal and not real , granted that average yearly inflation in the community during those years was approximately 2 % .    3.0951261450394196
leader + will last a year longer than leader 2 .    3.1901425139346613
leader + can cover all the regions of the eu , while leader 2 covered only the objective 1 regions and some objective 5b and 6 regions .    3.4851789119758747
we must point out , however , that even if the actual appropriations available for leader + were increased , the community initiative would still be ineffectual because such programmes cannot compensate for or blunt the anti - farming nature of the cap that will be implemented in the context of ' agenda 2000 ' and the wto . the real outcome of such programmes is to act as a cover - up , to lead people off the UNK and to UNK consciences .    4.106143022983057
we disagree with many of the report ' s views .    4.421679727002879
once more , we point to the negative changes of the cap ( 1992 - agenda 2000 ) .    3.5112346962582848
we do not think leader + will contribute UNK towards solving the countryside ' s problems , which are characterised by the decline of farming , which was and should remain the countryside ' s basic social and economic branch .    3.683157608055589
for our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .    3.1258487773679873
we will make every effort to improve them as much as possible and prevent them from being wasted , and most important of all , we will try to foster the struggle of farmers against the disastrous cap which is UNK them and leading them towards economic decline and the UNK of the countryside .    3.586589613290525
unless this cap is UNK , no programme can ensure the survival of small and medium - scale farmers and the social and economic regeneration of the countryside .    3.52321288123753
all the members in the union for a europe of nations group voted in favour of almost the whole of the procacci report on the leader + community initiative .    3.813655960554578
however , we amended the draft report adopted by the committee on agriculture and rural development in order to clarify certain points which will make this community initiative more effective .    3.6815527048825323
in particular we felt it was necessary to simplify the administrative and financial procedures which proved to be too cumbersome and slow in the leader ii initiative .    2.9746463941907684
it was also essential to ensure that better account is taken of the development priorities of local operators and that the benefit of leader + funds is not limited solely to agricultural regions with a low population density .    3.8859653122442768
amendment no 10 which i tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of ' economic and social cohesion ' rather than ' regional development ' as the european union does not have any recognised competence in this area .    4.0356576462249905
amendment no 11 replaces ' government or municipal officials ' with ' government officials ' .    3.0780199634259593
although local action groups should consist of a balanced and representative selection of partners drawn from the different socio - economic sectors of the territory concerned , government officials must be involved at decision - making level , whether they come from the municipalities , departments , regions or national governments .    3.6243925769978413
the rapporteur ' s UNK was therefore too limiting .    3.647749461969174
amendment no 12 responds to the expectations of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism of this house .    2.6329387192803595
it specifies the necessary coordination between leader + and community cooperation and partnership programmes such as interreg , phare , sapard or meda .    2.4004456858484726
the real priority for the european continent is to establish an operational level within a european framework and not a global framework as proposed by the rapporteur .    4.205997559229632
the creation of organisations similar to the lags may be usefully encouraged by the european union , provided that the corresponding costs are borne by the various partners .    3.804619410432872
in essence , we are , of course , in favour of this leader + community initiative .    3.5759883004641675
the conference on rural development held in cork from 7 to 9 november 1996 set rural development as one of the european union ' s priorities since it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole rural fabric , including infrastructure , public and private services and so on .    2.873801831767882
the budget allocated to leader + for a period of seven years is half that allocated to leader ii for a period of six years .    3.417117883090112
this is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences for farmers of the fall in prices and aid specified in the reform of the cap following the berlin agreements .    4.044715581437396
finally , among the priority parameters to be introduced at european level to enable local involvement , particular attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been implemented by lags within the leader ii initiative , but which could not be concluded due to the timetable and weight of the management mechanisms specified .    3.667004590315589
additives in feedingstuffs    5.789047705079464
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0015 / 2000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a council directive amending directive 70 / 524 / eec concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) 388 - c5 - 0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( cns ) .    1.8441168236030565
mr president , commissioner byrne , under directive 70 / 524 , high - technology additives are treated differently , depending on the date of authorisation .    2.8280921760784365
the commission has proposed harmonising the authorisation procedure so that substances UNK before 1988 are put on an equal footing with substances authorised now .    2.671744252870952
as far as we in the committee on agriculture and rural development are concerned , so far so good .    3.5702478605931165
however , the directive also encompasses the authorisation of antibiotics , drugs , growth - promoters and genetically - modified organisms .    2.3860791367413494
that makes it a question of health , not just approximating laws , which is why we in the committee on agriculture take the view that the legal base - article 37 - is not admissible here and that the commission should submit its proposal to us on the basis of article 152 , that is to say with codecision by parliament .    4.625290604959487
however , we in the committee on agriculture have not confined ourselves to approximating laws ; because this proposal also encompasses genetically - modified organisms , we have tabled a further proposed amendment which affects the content and hence public health .    3.322331162602529
we negotiated with the commission for two years on the seed directive and came to a compromise regulating the release of genetically - modified organisms in the directive , taking the text on which directive 70 / 524 is based as a starting point .    3.6076224343263403
mr byrne , we fail to understand why the commission is not approximating the text on genetically - modified organisms as part of its harmonisation work .    3.8163341179595376
we have now tabled a proposed amendment on precisely this compromise with the commission on the text .    3.6478413295942986
moreover , this text has also been adopted in the forest directive on the use of forest reproductive material and we feel that this text urgently needs to be adopted in this directive as well .    4.387651791506816
the commission pointed out in committee that it plans to present a novel feed directive in the future .    3.3829412825478373
however , that should not prevent us from harmonising the text in order to ensure that there is no legal uncertainty between the various directives .    3.8353766236539397
we are therefore assuming that you will accept our proposed amendment with regard to genetically - modified organisms .    3.2589128360585775
directive 70 / 524 still contains the old text because the seed directive was submitted to parliament in 1986 and we then negotiated with the commission until 1988 , while the report on this directive was dealt with in 1994 and parliament obviously did not accord genetically - modified organisms the same importance then as it did later when i was rapporteur .    3.4646001348672444
we therefore assume , commissioner byrne , that you too will accept our proposed amendment of the legal base .    3.3216963272714892
if you do not , we must reserve the right to refer this report back to committee and then negotiate this sensitive point with you , exactly as we did with the seed directive . i should point out that the text which we have now worked out is a valid compromise , both for your legal service and ours .    3.9074150113541912
in other words , we do not need to re - negotiate the text ; we merely need to adopt this text in the directive .    3.297307220548162
i can hardly wait , commissioner byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .    3.6119328726128965
mr president , commissioner , does regulating additives in feedingstuffs come under competition or consumer policy ?    2.759768162769429
as far the commission and the legal affairs committee are concerned , it comes under competition .    4.777512755448317
of course we have to take account of the competitiveness of the feedingstuffs industry by harmonising provisions for substances authorised before and after 1988 .    3.462735675975954
we want to prevent the prices of feedingstuffs from rising and mr UNK ' s proposed amendments nos 4 and 5 therefore deserve our support .    3.508120507611746
however , as mr graefe zu baringdorf has said in his report , this is first and foremost a consumer policy matter .    4.102364332405729
food safety must take absolute priority over feedingstuffs in all our discussions .    3.1871835865625227
when we talk of transparency in the food chain , that applies from the UNK to the table UNK and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs .    4.006316597988546
the antibiotics , growth promoters and genetically - modified organisms mixed in with feedingstuffs end up in the human food chain .    3.3331101217955075
the dioxin scandal brought home to us that we have to get out of this mess once and for all and regulating additives in feedingstuffs is a step in the right direction .    3.1791198067921074
according to article 152 of the ec treaty , we are obliged to UNK sources of danger to human health , whereby the UNK is clearly on sources .    3.9238570373542485
consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i . e . harmful additives in feedingstuffs .    3.3578063144630086
otherwise , in my view , we are UNK away at the symptoms , but not the causes .    4.479579338797249
people are especially UNK of gmos .    3.336968930008463
we must confront increasing public awareness of gmos by regulating their use in feedingstuffs accordingly .    2.9411086342720516
first , if an additive consists of or contains genetically - modified organisms , then it should only be authorised if it poses no risk to human health or the environment .    3.152768356657593
secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically - modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .    3.5401688215345035
and thirdly , if we are to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label genetically - modified feedingstuffs .    4.5376353434507
a clear declaration on feedingstuffs will allow double freedom of choice , both for the party using the feedingstuff and the subsequent consumer .    3.3016206940610786
responsible citizens should , in my view , have a choice .    4.4246345505290785
we all talk of UNK citizens who have lost confidence in food safety .    3.194622159392221
by regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence .    4.01127758422345
i too , therefore , can hardly wait to hear what you have to say to our proposed amendments .    3.914438251423065
consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .    3.2614673259157265
mr president , this proposal to amend the UNK directive on additives in feedingstuffs is the first in a whole series of proposals on the subject of feedingstuffs .    3.7960082390724814
in other words , we shall be discussing other proposals here in parliament over the next few months .    3.250649913894116
that this subject is of paramount importance is borne out by the huge public attention which the dioxin , UNK , sludge and other scandals have attracted .    3.639208093435216
in other words , this is an important facet of public health protection , which is why we believe that article 152 should be taken as the legal base , not article 37 , as proposed by the commission .    4.0514704686473415
the amendment which the commission has proposed , namely equal treatment for additives authorised before or after 31 december 1987 , is UNK and has our full support .    3.3788305674270753
however , the committee on agriculture and rural development has voted unanimously on some important amendments to the commission proposal .    3.3937455283053506
the regulation proposed by the commission conceals the danger of creating a marketing monopoly for certain additives .    3.5733930405267142
only companies which obtained the original authorisation will have the right to apply and companies which obtained authorisation at a later date will be excluded .    3.857444431720085
this sort of monopoly , which could lead , for example , to an increase in the price of feedingstuffs , should be prevented by granting provisional authorisation to all companies which had marketed a specific substance by 1 april 1998 .    3.690565527125932
this would then apply until the re - assessment procedure has been completed .    3.1692948728255397
the most important amendment to the commission proposal is the inclusion , as recommended by the rapporteur , of genetically - modified organisms in the directive on additives , taking the compromise negotiated between parliament and the commission on authorisation for gmos outside the scope of the release directive as the starting point .    3.8701926621400395
this already gives us a basis for the authorisation of gmos .    3.82302706010152
it is therefore only logical that we make provision for genetically modified feedingstuff additives in this case , just as we have in regulations already passed in other areas , such as forest reproductive material , to mention just one example .    3.7166530636616213
the labelling of genetically - modified additives is particularly important in this respect .    3.4564069247425864
on the one hand , it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and , on the other hand , it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using gmos .    2.9665486242067285
finally , our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur , who has gone to a great deal of trouble .    3.7709522907175184
i think that we can all hardly wait to hear mr byrne ' s reply .    2.85426176586219
mr president , the report deals mainly with formalities , in other words , the manner in which additives will be authorised . it is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work .    3.1280230821663264
i should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that , in future , all the directives are dealt with under article 152 , since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview .    3.571629245315969
we cannot carry on as we have done up until now , that is to say dealing with each detail on its own , often only after the harm has already been done .    3.988290036528359
the rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of gmos in feed additives .    2.925865132107245
however , i should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics .    3.4634769565106427
certainly , five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned .    3.3108255524019636
it is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four , both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves .    3.89702926425928
we now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people ' s health , particularly in the case of small children .    3.5478675370167116
a number of member states are already able to show UNK that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary .    3.378492355430198
several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same .    3.428467946326143
we talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but , in the case of antibiotics , it has long since been forgotten .    4.855058894816546
however , there is another environmental principle at stake , namely the exchange principle .    3.651487341194219
i should like to say a few words about coccidiostats .    2.4109424231119543
they are a UNK product which is not totally necessary .    4.069182691650442
there is a substitute , which is used to UNK UNK .    4.571561401857121
although it is a little more expensive , it does not harm the environment .    4.072295867792167
coccidiostats now accompany the UNK that is spread on the fields . in that way , they end up in our water supplies which , as we all know , are our most vital resource .    3.96006137376352
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives .    2.8686543238287765
yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected belgium and other european countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition .    3.604785401644005
you may recall , even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public , that the commission ' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin - loaded chemical UNK in the UNK of UNK fruit imported from brazil .    3.485925591195048
we must therefore closely examine all the elements of the chain involved in the manufacture of feedingstuffs for production animals .    3.23702611996163
incidentally , it is ironic that the problem is much less serious for the feedingstuffs of our UNK , UNK and other domestic animals .    4.420320973729549
is it because of cut - throat and globalised competition that industrialists have allowed this sector to become a way of recycling all the waste from the agri - foodstuffs industry ?    3.0827513115211156
such a serious issue cannot be limited to a technical debate , even though it is the directive itself which limits the authorisation of antibiotics and other growth promoters .    3.7414757370002114
the UNK which we are preparing to take in respect of feedingstuffs must also be applied to the food for the very farm animals which reach our UNK .    4.55754482780007
as forcefully underlined by this report , labelling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer on his holding is aware of all the ingredients in the feed which he is giving his livestock .    3.7868971837666225
he must also know whether his UNK of protein UNK includes gmos as these components could represent a risk to public health .    2.9050891029950017
in any case , the precautionary principle requires these products to be clearly UNK at all stages of their marketing .    3.1295864892470484
however , before labelling we need clear rules .    2.921725570590043
straight questions must be asked about the real end - use of animal UNK , for example .    3.699839141742014
although we are looking at all the problems caused by these products in ethical and health terms , it is their use which must be questioned today .    4.40831140491438
in this respect , the chapter of the white paper on food safety which deals with feedingstuffs must serve as a working basis for going beyond mere commercial questions .    2.7062674943473333
the commission has on many occasions used the farm - to - table example which our colleague in the ppe group has just underlined .    3.3875349103588186
this is a good idea but it must be made to be meaningful and , to do this , the problems linked to animals and those linked to consumer health must be dealt with at the same time .    3.8053380781682637
this is why it is essential to approve amendment no 2 to recital 4 which UNK the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re - evaluation procedure .    3.2485764118748053
also , amendments nos 4 and 5 to the new article UNK must be approved as these will ensure that genetically modified additives are clearly identified as such , thus allowing users to make fully informed decisions .    3.560126810876068
mr president , because of the availability of high - technology additives in the feedingstuffs industry , detailed information on their use is needed from the actors , and as we know there are a lot of them , so that we can put a stop to practices which infringe community law .    3.8487168712563613
this directive on additives in feedingstuffs cannot achieve this on its own .    3.3956788085202896
other directives will follow and i believe that the committee on agriculture is well placed to deal with them .    4.162389076523627
up the point at which meat , milk , bread and other products are sold over the shop counter , feedingstuffs and additives are structured , mixed , UNK , cut and transported several times .    3.0552028620598515
the fight by feedingstuff manufacturers to gain maximum market shares causes a lot of problems , just as it does in the foodstuffs industry .    3.61960259675515
the negative consequences are well known , the positive ones less so .    3.5630460281143934
i am firmly convinced that the most sensible way of protecting the health of european citizens in the ecological chain is through the production of feedingstuffs in the region for the region .    3.91012660697246
however , more work is needed on this .    3.1612229891146275
mr president , may i commence by congratulating the rapporteur , mr graefe zu baringdorf , on his report .    2.425482264173729
the events of the past couple of years have certainly created an awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health .    3.3817382456100384
the swift action taken by this parliament must be seen by all citizens as their greatest guarantee for the future , for you have set an agenda on food quality to which member states must UNK .    4.467673297669927
but even in this crucial area of administration , parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging member states to take on and to face up to their responsibility .    3.8879978267655098
in agenda 2000 , we have in my view prioritised policies that are of direct concern to citizens : food safety , water quality , environmental protection and rural development .    4.521317445392304
if we pursue this agenda with commitment and diligence , the early years of the new millennium will be a milestone in the implementation of policies that are people - focused and very much reflect community needs .    3.8348370169994483
i welcome in particular the proposed new and strict authorisation procedures for additives in animal feeds .    3.395752410775786
those found in breach of them must be dealt with severely .    3.58477447170529
i compliment the new commissioner responsible for food safety , mr byrne .    3.616963595328218
he has an onerous undertaking but he has responded quickly and effectively to the requirements of this house , as well as to the concern of consumers .    3.8291982646369727
i am particularly pleased that my own country , ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability .    3.9841601659491452
this will make the island of ireland the centre of excellence in the future for food production .    3.9796787321011657
mr president , commissioner , i too congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work . i am particularly pleased about the unanimity shown on this issue within the group .    3.5890052523873197
it is therefore specified that , through the adoption of a regulation , the commission will replace the existing authorisations with authorisations linked to the person responsible for putting the additives into circulation . this will occur at the same time for all the additives in question .    4.130490400600783
a coherent legal framework must be re - established .    3.2363073498505512
as of october 1999 the commission proposed introducing a legal basis into directive 70 / 524 / eec for the UNK of the authorisations .    3.4951404404820092
however , we must ensure that competition distortions are not created , as highlighted by mr kindermann and mrs auroi .    2.663582763401345
genetically modified additives must also be clearly identified in feedingstuffs in order to allow the end - consumer to choose food without gmo components or based on gmo components and to guarantee this .    4.085193240111763
the consumer must remain free to make a fully informed decision .    4.175976966606847
this proposal has no financial consequences for the community budget .    3.565191495956808
there must therefore be total transparency for producers and consumers in the area of food safety .    3.301810400992936
i am sure that the commission can accept the report which , as you know , was approved unanimously in the committee on agriculture and rural development .    3.3402736411667053
mr president , we have said in this house time and again since the bse crisis that feedingstuffs are one of the first and most important factors in safe food production and in consumer health and protection .    3.9087441157968077
we therefore welcome the commission ' s proposal on additives in feedingstuffs .    2.6516450772436846
the committee on behalf of which i am speaking , namely the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , decided in december , on the assumption that the chairman of the committee on agriculture would draft such a good report , that we could waive our opinion .    4.416730971457607
nevertheless , i should like to say a few words on the report and express a view on a number of points .    3.385049737735341
first , perhaps , i should say something on the question of the legal base .    4.3316947761712346
even if we have new rules of procedure in parliament , and it may well be that , with such an ambitious chairman in the committee on agriculture , problems of legislative competence will arise more and more frequently between the committee on agriculture and the committee on the environment , one thing is always crystal clear for me in this sort of conflict : cohesion in this parliament is crucial and the legal basis of a question is crucial as far as i am concerned .    4.479502168875308
therefore , and i must address this comment to you mr byrne , i reject your choice of legal basis .    3.369644649836089
if it is merely a hand - me - down legal basis taken over from previous directives , then it is a mistake to keep it .    3.8396204954661663
the treaty of amsterdam states quite clearly that , where people ' s health is concerned , article 152 is the correct legal base , and may i say to our own committee on legal affairs and the internal market that it is simply not good enough to look at the commission ' s proposal and say , there is nothing in it about health and consumer protection , so it has nothing to do with health and consumer protection .    4.010694883627412
my group , as mr kindermann has already said , will therefore vote tomorrow to change the legal base and i hope that other groups in this house will do likewise .    4.4763799337074
mr byrne , i ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation .    4.302278611814399
if we do not change it and we follow the legal affairs committee , we shall be opening the UNK to manipulation .    3.9933563283291544
the commission would be able to determine the choice of legal basis by excluding any reference to health policy and we would suddenly find ourselves up against an article 37 .    3.799245804900513
allow me to comment briefly on two other points . first , genetically modified micro - organisms in feedingstuffs .    2.7630054072802888
we cannot just refer to vertical legislation and say that at some point we will need another law .    3.678064349255853
we do not have another law at the moment , and until we do , we must deal with genetically - modified micro - organisms as and when we pass legislation ; we must include them as an add - on and insist that they be labelled .    3.72772416364557
the rapporteur has done just that and that is a good sign .    4.324745724090999
i say now , as i have said on numerous occasions in the past : yes , i too would like the commission to propose a positive list which we can then debate and deal with in this house , but we do at least need a starting point for a positive list of additives in feedingstuffs .    4.346581455592443
it is equally important to have strict hygiene requirements for the manufacture of additives and for proper controls to be carried out in the member states .    2.978052398184984
there are serious shortcomings in both areas and we have a great deal of work to do yet .    3.7970705441951034
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .    2.03854290943265
this is an issue that we will no doubt be UNK on a number of occasions in the future .    3.913487467515339
what has happened in recent years has brought to our attention the tremendous problems facing not only to the producers of food but also the consumers .    3.890441083726472
we must strike a balance between them .    3.1389522468873383
we must resolve this issue , because it is important that consumers should regain confidence in the food they eat .    3.88942760100999
one way to achieve this is to have total transparency as far as food labelling is concerned .    4.911332634292474
gmos are the new challenge facing us .    3.2838938436074376
this is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : i myself share these concerns .    3.1872171437011123
but i think we should not allow our concerns about gmos to UNK our concerns about growth promoters used in animal feed or antibiotics used in compound feed .    3.423550554408289
indeed , we should not allow gmos to obscure the fact that meat and UNK are still included in animal feeds in many countries in europe .    3.6353800103936327
one factor behind these developments that has been referred to in this debate is competition - competition between member states on the cost of the production of food .    4.461091552768023
these are all areas in which we have to ensure a level playing field : food must be of the same standard in all member states .    3.6384869225974352
we have had the dioxin scare , bse and many other problems .    3.0895126085320124
the main problem is a financial one , namely who bears the cost ?    3.259339720921647
the problem is that the cost is not shared equally between the consumer and the producer : the producer has been forced to bear all the cost .    3.2006924358044766
we need an equitable distribution of the extra cost that has been incurred .    3.388931265819175
we must also ensure that the food that is imported into the european union meets the standards within the european union .    3.6661569598589456
if we do not maintain those standards for imported food then we are going to encounter greater difficulties in the future .    3.2090780376902748
. i should first like to thank the committee on agriculture and rural development and its rapporteur , the committee chairman , mr graefe zu baringdorf , for examining the commission ' s proposal .    3.546934063230738
the commission proposal is , as some of you have said , rather technical .    3.761614289842057
nonetheless it has a relatively simple objective : to harmonise procedures governing the authorisation of feed additives .    3.387093266237578
at present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations , depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 january 1988 .    3.4003949789522907
the purpose of the commission ' s proposal is to harmonise procedures to ensure that no such difference exists .    3.8516262253248237
the scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited .    4.218008716255376
five amendments have been presented by parliament .    4.157512421332429
i regret that the commission is not in a position to accept these amendments , despite the fact that i am fully aware of the views and commitment of parliament , the agricultural committee and , in particular , the rapporteur , mr graefe zu baringdorf , on these issues .    3.9768916843466537
i shall deal with each of the individual amendments separately .    3.7778209107791674
the first amendment proposes to change the legal base of the proposal by replacing article 37 with article 152 .    3.4796110535345335
i would simply point out that the commission proposal makes no reference to health or consumer protection .    4.038385841334487
the proposed amendment is technical and cannot be interpreted as having as its primary objective the protection of public health .    3.1460218749602253
i note that parliament ' s committee on legal affairs and the internal market also accepts that article 37 is the appropriate legal base .    2.8786953309513454
i remind parliament that in article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health .    3.8715573132852152
i commend to you the arguments set out in the letter from the legal affairs committee which sets out the position , in my view , with precision , clarity and commendable UNK .    3.5497596760342645
amendments nos 2 and 3 go much further than the commission proposal since they aim to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives .    3.311948495717758
i am the first to accept that gmos are a very important issue .    3.752268849683594
however , this technical amendment is not the correct instrument to introduce such initiatives .    3.7998492362148033
the commission is of the view that it is premature to amend the rules currently laid down by directive 70 / 524 on genetically modified additives at this stage .    3.4571364988270914
instead it is appropriate to await developments in relation to the common position on the amendment to directive 90 / 220 , which is currently in second reading in parliament .    4.097390497146607
the commission envisages going much further than is currently proposed by parliament in its amendments .    3.4019511732524146
i can also assure parliament that i will ensure that the UNK provisions of directive 90 / 220 are included in the proposal for a recasting of directive 70 / 524 that the commission has proposed in the white paper on food safety to present to parliament before july 2001 .    3.6836093606812246
i can also assure parliament that all observations made here today will be fully taken into account .    2.639804860706121
amendments nos 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they give UNK preference to copy products by granting them authorisation to be placed into circulation even before an application for authorisation has been submitted .    2.795544337681552
the commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations .    2.7920642377967466
i can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues .    3.9692137623539754
i should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate .    3.9556168541970016
first of all , regarding the observations made by mr graefe zu baringdorf , i wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of gmo additives in the additives directive 70 / 524 , and not in the novel feed directive .    3.397599591539125
this is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives .    2.943962355196606
the text taken by parliament is from the directive which was adopted in 1998 .    3.8327717958418894
but the vertical legislation in directive 90 / 220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of gmos has changed since then and is still changing .    3.252081478414149
it is before parliament for second reading .    3.365967227648957
it is my belief that we should await the final outcome of directive 90 / 220 and in particular , article 11 .    3.8562923535314253
mr kindermann and mrs auroi made reference to this .    3.0060757320981137
there are just a few points i should like to make on that issue .    4.148614571632537
first of all , this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993 , so it has not really been UNK on any other commodity producers .    3.68452423731834
indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product .    3.6078056964542875
i should also stress that the commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for gmos to be included in additives .    3.568394960964487
mrs roth - behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base , whether it should be article 37 or article 152 .    3.8252587151703747
i again refer to what i said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the house that it would be entirely inappropriate for the commission to seek to justify any measure based on article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health .    4.1198307747669585
this is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the european court of justice , which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation .    3.806750118910828
the UNK of the court appears to be quite clear in relation to this .    3.967678408740382
a number of you made reference - mr UNK in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling .    4.04640100561933
directive 70 / 524 foresees the issue of labelling in the genetic modification of additives .    3.2000332037867487
it is already included now : " indication of the particular characteristics due to the manufacturing products " .    3.5536281151810076
so this issue will be addressed .    3.4659110499621537
that formula enabled us to oblige applicants to put on the label the fact that genetic modification techniques have been used in the product , the subject matter of the application .    4.227206659697682
first allow me to point out , commissioner byrne , that the european parliament has no right of legislative initiative .    4.5904931069667825
but we do reserve the right , when you propose to amend a directive or a regulation , to look at the whole regulation and not just the part which you have singled out .    3.988195387748491
nonetheless , we have confined ourselves in our proposed amendments to bringing the text into line with that of other directives and we have disregarded the question of content .    4.4333762907464465
for example , you did not go into antibiotics .    3.652875125064983
we are therefore talking about harmonising the legal provisions in the individual directives .    3.1328187191581147
my question , commissioner byrne is this : the un conference in montreal decided that genetically - modified organisms must be labelled for international trade .    3.1624440053580027
do you really believe that , if we could , parliament would permit labelling to be left off feedingstuff additives within the european union ?    4.15642037991958
commissioner byrne , it appears that you want to engage in a test of strength with parliament .    3.8531759276746618
we negotiated the seed marketing legislation for two years .    3.0021629302313784
i look forward to the next round .    3.5057501565171605
. i would stress that no gmos have been approved under this directive ; it applies only to additives .    3.4279127160525418
i would also say in relation to the questions surrounding labelling that this is a complex issue .    4.010538611988137
it is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way , particularly in directive 90 / 220 .    4.050543806762387
this issue is before parliament at the moment and there will be other directives dealing it , which will also come under the legal base of article 152 which gives parliament full competence in the areas of codecision .    4.155957715270534
the best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before parliament at the moment , as well as the legislation in the pipeline , rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in directive 90 / 220 may not be fully taken into account .    3.6178293614988104
it is best to wait for that debate which , i understand , will take place fairly soon .    4.50610198020443
all of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .    3.4887891632742667
parliament has taken due note of your comments .    3.505811000827608
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
scrapie    5.317817707778928
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0023 / 2000 ) by mr böge , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending council directive 91 / 68 / ec as regards scrapie ( com ( 1998 ) 623 - c4 - 0026 / 1999 - 1998 / 0324 ( cod ) .    1.923016174424842
in this respect , the commission ' s proposals to amend directive 91 / 68 and delete the reference to scrapie and the report by mrs roth - behrendt on the detection and control of tse UNK in general , comply with parliament ' s demands in the wake of the follow - up report by the bse committee of inquiry and we expressly welcome this .    3.3848494472832953
i should , however , like to add that no new scientific knowledge was needed which proved that the experimental infection of sheep by feeding them bse - infected feed produced a clinical expression of the disease which is UNK from the symptoms of scrapie .    3.21231585736985
no new knowledge was needed , because the theory from the beginning was that bse and scrapie must be related and this theory has increasingly taken hold .    3.245662768399028
from this point of view we are slightly behind the times .    3.0912677574470675
i am therefore in complete agreement with the commission ' s proposal on scrapie .    3.1156003351908286
i should , however , like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new tse regulation allows a reasonable UNK between consumer protection and practicable suggestions .    3.4703808032569925
we therefore need to take consistent account of six or seven points in the coming debate on the tse proposal , and that of course includes scrapie .    4.221258648737861
when we discuss the tse regulation , commissioner , we must also clarify that we shortly intend to discuss separate proposals under article 152 as the corresponding legal base for products excluded from this regulation , such as UNK , UNK products or animal feed .    3.868164472047766
we insist on this .    3.2958276158825277
as far as i am concerned , that means that fundamental core provisions in this proposed regulation must not be relegated yet again to the annex but included in the body of the proposed regulation because we here in parliament want to and will assume joint responsibility here .    3.336093140319486
it also means that , when we are fighting these diseases , the problem of destroying whole UNK in the event of an outbreak of scrapie or bse and the question of defining geographical areas are items which also remain on the agenda .    3.5717266783646155
although i welcome the fact that the fight against scrapie is included in the tse regulation , i feel that the commission ' s proposals for fighting scrapie are still not consistent enough and i shall submit amendments on behalf of the committee for agriculture and rural development to tighten up the proposals when the roth - behrendt report is debated .    3.9645552028249913
i should also like to address two other points . we expressly welcome the regional classification of the status of member states as regards outbreaks of scrapie or tses .    3.210510713389984
here again the commission is increasing its response to the work carried out by and the demands made by parliament .    4.442495583561427
finally , in discussing the question of the future application of tests , we should of course bear in mind that we have still not reached the point where tests are generally applicable .    4.120292533350522
but the tests available now are perfectly able to guarantee security in consumer health policy , albeit not for every individual animal .    3.1289715836855923
but when we need to consider if a region can move from a negative epidemiological status to a better category , an epidemiological inspection of the situation in a region in the form of suitable UNK in UNK using such tests can provide useful UNK in the political and scientific debate as to where there is a need for preventive consumer protection and , basically , where such tests can be used to help us settle disputes on a proper basis .    4.130644920532222
i would be grateful , commissioner , if you would take these passing comments on board in the report on scrapie and in the general report on the fight against tses and bear in mind that we shall be calling you to account on these points .    4.527458867726197
mr president , over the years , the following situation has arisen : one subject has developed into a subject of many facets .    3.1994650414614187
many of us here in this house have spent years , whether we intended to or not , dealing solely with the consequences of the bse scandal right down to the last detail .    3.9754144863446337
and it is still on the agenda today .    4.274615805381889
the cast is always the same .    3.68802828474767
although the cause was unfortunate , it was certainly not the worst experience of this parliament .    3.8624311968578624
my task as draftsman of the opinion of the environment committee is a very simple one .    4.173109578133477
i agree with the rapporteur and am able to say that the environment committee has asked the committee on agriculture and rural development to agree to the commission proposal .    3.971276583706934
that saves a great deal of time which i would like to use for other things and which i shall use now somewhat in anticipation , as mr böge has just done .    4.312747124252864
i have yet to submit my report on tses to the house .    3.333238373981766
at first we were somewhat UNK and we regret that now .    3.649290445877834
but i have come to the conclusion that it was in fact quite clever timing .    3.8284051909619765
this debate does in fact give us an excellent opportunity , mr byrne , to give the commission a few things to think about .    4.352797044174571
although we did not have a very positive exchange on mr graefe zu baringdorf ' s report earlier on and will certainly have to agree to disagree , things may be different with this report .    4.101956578065738
allow me to say from the outset that the part of the complex report which mr böge dealt with - and this form of collaboration between two committees , with one leading committee and the other giving an opinion and vice versa , worked very well and could perhaps be used as a model for the future - is relatively simple .    3.8148873676424535
it will become more difficult once we see the tse proposal , mr byrne .    3.2796902679804547
when we have the chance to ask direct questions , the questions which mr böge referred to will be asked .    3.4233429643327957
questions will be asked - questions which i shall have to put to you and the commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the bse status of the member states and other third countries .    4.639088592938411
how will bse status in fact be defined then ?    3.2782444815889638
do you envisage circumstances under which the bse status will depend on the willingness to apply a bse test ?    3.314684720530626
and then there is my standing question to you mr byrne , a question you certainly already know and which will not surprise you . what about the bse test ?    3.5788739649606205
when will you make it compulsory ?    3.277240057124907
perhaps you will do so before parliament debates the tse report .    3.6376429941240964
i know that i am a thorn in your side on this , but sometimes that is my job .    4.003763682303747
i say quite emphatically , even after the report by mr graefe zu baringdorf , who is completely involved in the whole idea , that animal feeding , animal UNK , animal production must be suited to the species and must also , above all , cause no harm or danger to human beings .    3.478568997432767
that is , without doubt , too short , too UNK and too little .    3.7780439957154166
you are lucky that mr böge ' s report only deals with this on the sidelines ; with my report you will have to justify yourself more thoroughly and you will have more trouble doing so .    3.5880007427167606
finally , just one more brief comment , mr byrne .    3.373938202767981
we have a new commission .    3.270927257378313
whether or not we will agree with the work carried out by this commission and the president of the commission , only time will tell .    4.245294797971401
but there is one thing we certainly will not let you get away with and i am sure that , as a lawyer and politician you will understand this . important issues cannot be regulated in annexes .    3.6748118076781253
they belong in the legislative text . i might do the same if i were a commissioner , because i could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and i would not always need to work with parliament , which takes so long and is so difficult .    4.395203493065403
but you must understand that we cannot let you get away with this .    3.24393863199908
in other words , whenever i get the chance , i shall take everything out of the annexes and UNK it into the legislative text .    3.6706651907909293
and you would be well advised to do likewise from the outset .    3.634669232325247
mr president , commissioner , i should like to remind you of the composition of our food chain and how important it is for this chain to provide us with safe , healthy food which is produced , as a matter of principle , without any questionable or risky interim or end products .    2.9085558546041743
over recent years , these basic principles have often been UNK in animal UNK and in epidemiological matters because of shoddy practice or UNK .    3.2247547647196844
the european parliament has already taken a clear stand on bse and i think that we should do likewise on all epidemics in animals .    3.455635114850361
we should not allow food safety to be compromised because , in the final analysis , it is our health which is at stake .    3.6033615655982505
the commission ' s proposal encompasses both the transportation and the placing on the market of sheep and goats and a community regulation to fight scrapie .    2.932968254670758
this is even more important given that there is no clear proof that bse and scrapie are unrelated .    3.372945969355879
animals are bought throughout europe and transported over the entire continent .    3.535316884682503
the spread of an epidemic as the result of bringing in one sick animal can have huge consequences for farmers .    3.471505323432858
and i should point out that , for the first time in history , a case of scrapie was detected in austria about four weeks ago .    3.752904468310742
scrapie is a particularly insidious disease because the UNK can remain active in dust for years and is then ingested in food .    3.3536280926470146
the disease is always fatal .    3.2418766693202756
as there is no vaccination , farmers can only protect themselves by not buying animals from countries in which there are cases of scrapie .    3.5069411948497855
even if scrapie cannot be passed on to human beings , the connection with bse has still not been clarified , as i have already said .    3.224382189524248
as a farmer myself , i am most concerned that consumer health should not be put at risk .    3.988187519431301
i am in favour of preventive measures , starting with feeding which is suitable for the species , rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out .    3.2873179290686654
i therefore welcome the commission ' s initiative to create a new legal base for combating scrapie .    3.476946911586671
mr president , commissioner , mr böge ' s report on measures to prevent tse diseases is based on the proposals of the european parliament ' s temporary bse committee .    3.434137012841014
mr böge was responsible for some invaluable work on this committee , and it is a relief to see that the job of monitoring the work of the bse committee in the committee on agriculture and rural development has fallen to him : he is the one with the experience .    4.1159837208819186
i would have liked my speech to be part of a discussion that would have also treated the second part of the commission ' s proposal .    3.5403163919285228
i do not think it appropriate to have to conduct in part the same discussion when mrs roth - behrendt ' s report from the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy is featured in the plenary session .    2.786506827459778
in the previous speech mrs UNK said that UNK is an insidious disease .    3.585794511711068
it is indeed .    3.029828940417194
for me as a UNK , and a member who has been active in matters concerning agriculture and the health and transportation of animals , it is most important that those eu states where tses do not occur at all will in the future too be guaranteed the right to inspect as fully as is necessary the transportation of live animals .    4.214306252073361
i wish to stress how important it is for us to remain free of disease .    3.619329548270184
the possibility , if necessary , of having additional inspections of animals in these areas is not a question of artificial protectionism or the restriction of freedom of movement , as there really is justification for it .    3.659004160273083
the inspections must be seen as being fair and cost - effective action to promote the UNK of animals and prevent increased expenditure for the eu .    4.127636371748078
on behalf of the european liberal democrats , we can support the commission ' s proposal on mr böge ' s report , but in the forthcoming debate on mrs roth - behrendt ' s report we must look again at the position of those countries where tses do not occur .    3.966386352463048
mr president , i too would like to offer my congratulations to the rapporteur .    3.006021311790423
there is no doubt that mr böge and the rapporteur for the committee on the environment are now tremendous experts in this field .    3.467742889369826
it is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of parliament because it is extremely important .    4.637965978016564
regardless of the many other concerns we may have , bse has given us a terrible legacy that has to be dealt with and resolved .    4.066830740505667
it is quite clear that the incidence of scrapie in sheep has been a contributing factor to the overall problem .    3.2021063326395134
i welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , i hope , address this situation .    3.6441230579519694
we must ensure that nothing can enter the food chain or the animal compound feed to allow what we have experienced in the past to happen again in the future .    3.4014540367622548
no - one would want to see what happened to farmers with bse happen ever again .    3.2580731899774875
we have to bring in the most stringent rules and we have to make them work .    4.655977632150744
it is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it .    3.674406268508247
bse has certainly not gone away .    3.811921317770471
you can see it in different countries .    3.363060304155301
i do not want to point the finger at any particular country , but many countries are now facing similar problems to those we have had in the united kingdom .    3.160389873765739
it will be there for some time to come .    3.8858449905009946
we have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence - building mechanism .    3.405472018397255
if we are not able to achieve that then we will have tremendous trouble in the future .    3.569229005577947
finally , i have certainly believed for a long time , coming from an agricultural background myself , that if we had fed the animals the proper food and if the animal UNK had been made up of the proper compounds we would never have had bse in the first place .    3.6547839899766354
it was never the responsibility of the farmer , it was the food UNK who caused this problem and we have to ensure that it never happens again .    4.049161549371633
. mr president , i am pleased to have been given this opportunity to discuss a subject where there is good cooperation between parliament and the commission , namely combating tses .    4.457729321362769
i should also like to thank mr böge for his work on this issue .    2.958528957421354
considerable progress has been made on our proposal for a european parliament and council regulation under article 152 of the treaty on the prevention and control of tses .    3.6617081777359677
this proposal addresses all tse risk in all animals at all stages of the production chain .    3.026970394944235
i am here today to listen to your opinions on the first step in this process of establishing a truly comprehensive community system for the control of these diseases .    4.016787662741945
i have proposed in the proposal at hand to delete all currently existing community rules on scrapie in sheep and goats and to transpose them to the framework proposal for a regulation .    3.4098521130598725
i have been informed that you welcome this initiative , as appears from your contributions this afternoon , to formulate a single text .    3.064884777165137
i am looking forward to discussing any further improvements you might wish to suggest under the framework proposal for the legislation , especially after the reference made by mrs roth - behrendt to her own report and opinion on this issue .    3.2538622662566357
i look forward to receipt of that document , which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue .    3.152919142972124
finally , i would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions , speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation .    3.3803891172844622
in the months i have been commissioner and observed the way legislation goes through the system , i can see that much work needs to be done on this issue so that we can all achieve what we seek to achieve , that is , the translation of policy into legislation .    4.224497027127487
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 a . m .    1.6572241642992718
community policy in the field of water    3.8297018834818504
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( a5 - 0027 / 2000 ) on the common position adopted by the council with a view to the adoption of a european parliament and council directive on establishing a framework for community action in the field of water policy ( UNK / 3 / 1999 - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1997 / UNK ( cod ) ( rapporteur : mrs lienemann ) .    2.7703067178704015
- ( fr ) mr president , commissioners , ladies and gentlemen , water will be one of the main environmental and world issues of the twenty - first century .    2.954023698951422
climate change , global resources , river quality and groundwater UNK quality are major challenges which threaten our common future .    3.0229435878559565
we will either be able to restore water quality to suit the planet ' s ecosystem or we will experience a whole range of adverse events which will threaten the development of certain regions , the living conditions of the inhabitants of other regions and even , more fundamentally , the global balance .    3.6257705892578564
to support this statement , i would point to an excellent report drafted by our colleague , UNK soares , in the international bodies on the state of the seas and oceans .    4.962586676863093
when talking about climate change , we have rightly referred to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere .    4.450475747686636
yet we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will significantly destabilise whole areas of our planet .    3.1353363261997123
europe must therefore lead by example to some extent , both because it must promote a certain development model and because it is itself facing serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters , including its groundwater , surface waters and seas .    3.4464762104745925
furthermore , europe has signed international conventions , in particular the ospar convention in which it made certain commitments .    4.278784887328467
in this it said that in a few years ' time we must have stopped dumping pollution and halted the increase of pollution and we must have reached a near zero level of toxic and dangerous substances .    3.9053816081735713
despite having signed these international agreements , this directive and the specific policies in the field reveal that europe cannot achieve the objectives set or must defer these for so long that the very credibility of its signature of these international conventions is threatened .    3.9171948448241536
this is why in the debate on the framework directive on water policy , the european parliament has since the first reading demanded coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives , particularly with regard to respect for ospar . this convergence must be effective and specific and must commit us to action .    4.148375068234191
the european union ' s water policy is not starting from zero .    3.2933863890809145
many directives have already been adopted . furthermore , the commission wants to make these directives more understandable and more compatible with each other and to give them clearer objectives .    4.3934218193181875
the preparation of this framework directive is therefore prompted by a desire for rationalisation .    3.775514883941749
however , at first reading this house insisted that the current directive should not only be compatible with the commitments made , like ospar , but should allow us to reverse the course of affairs .    4.067742194211286
for despite these directives and frequent declarations about the effort which must be made in terms of water protection , when we look at the state of the environment in europe we can see that the objectives have not been achieved .    4.83544989436044
in many cases the situation has deteriorated and we therefore cannot settle for just rationalisation of the texts .    3.378056204461439
we must set objectives which are equal to the challenges facing us .    3.539841392123354
yet we do not have much time .    2.910932883288567
we could , as the commission has proposed , accept these UNK deadlines which the commission and the council have extended even further . yet if we do , we will not only have a credibility problem with the general public , but these efforts will be postponed until tomorrow and then tomorrow they will be deferred again .    4.164353990966325
it is clear that in this event the objectives will never be achieved .    3.075899801155177
i am stressing this point because , when disasters are being reported daily in the news , we cannot just keep on saying for the umpteenth time that europe did not act when it should have done . then , in our haste , we act as if we will solve the problems which we refused to tackle properly at the appropriate time .    3.513584658023242
the current example of the danube and the pollution from UNK shows very clearly that if we fail to establish a new method of economic development , clear requirements , controls and precise measures concerning the state of our rivers , this type of incident will not only occur again but will do so increasingly over time .    3.7954185561750515
it is also clear that if we do nothing , our agriculture will continue to develop in a very unbalanced manner .    3.604886423840212
even now , the rivers in brittany are UNK and this is damaging tourism .    4.645742297496708
to conclude , the issues are clear at this second reading .    3.220123336076079
do we or do we not want standards compatible with ospar , in other words to get dangerous substances down to zero ?    3.4463014436630237
do we want to UNK the deadlines proposed by the council for this directive ?    5.037513648034676
do we want to have a pricing policy which enables all public and private participants to clean up and save water ?    3.6973302407962536
do we seriously want to respond to the hopes of our peoples ?    3.10833353774991
the majority of the amendments approved by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection meet these objectives . i hope they will be supported by this house .    3.3996710129330623
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , mrs lienemann has just painted a very drastic picture of how important water and air are to us , especially as the very source of life for human beings .    3.2805449886695053
the problem is one of both water quality and water resources , of which there is not a UNK supply everywhere in europe , especially in very dry regions .    4.624976502530584
i am sorry that commissioner wallström , who is responsible in this area , cannot be here now because this is , after all , a very , very important directive on which the commission has been working for a long time , and water protection legislation , which we are debating now at second reading , affects all the citizens of the european union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join , who will have to comply with eu legislation once they UNK .    4.427842397005594
we have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy in 1994 .    3.2039739800969635
a great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous members of the european parliament , the european commission and the council of ministers .    3.2083289653668063
we reduced the UNK proposed amendments in the environment committee to 77 , but another 30 have been added .    3.5983074083262663
you see , there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different .    4.379936332528407
some want tighter legislation , some want more clarification , others want to serve national interests .    3.120780387511955
even within my group , the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats , there were , of course , differences of opinion .    3.0486818346667617
our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions .    3.608677252333741
in this sense , the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position .    3.674754532264075
some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the european parliament ' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the council of ministers .    4.183647583795563
we obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the european parliament ' s credibility .    3.4085015527768996
for me , that includes the zero demand , i . e . the demand for zero inputs up to 2020 .    3.2335840891909333
that would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings .    2.952568028355103
i should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and european water protection laws , however UNK they are and however little they are complied with in the member states .    3.415474193743583
i only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the rhine , which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the UNK , which was particularly polluted .    3.932809880375782
that does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money .    3.767676482315215
farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days .    4.369575774183781
you can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water .    3.460976302655735
the line followed by our group for the negotiations with the council of ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too .    3.870247532077262
i am horrified that both members of parliament and the public have been UNK by false arguments in this difficult and sometimes highly technical matter .    3.9959901325946463
i therefore extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the group who helped us find compromises .    3.117979722706527
i also extend my special thanks to our rapporteur , mrs lienemann , for all her work and her cooperative attitude , even if we have agreed to differ on certain points .    3.338183675716887
and i also thank the representatives of the european commission , who stood by with advice and expert help at all times .    3.482127929538933
if the representatives of the council of ministers take an equally constructive approach , then i have no doubt that together we shall find an even better solution to the problem of water protection in europe under the conciliation procedure .    3.927479871538447
mr president , i would firstly like to congratulate mrs lienemann on the excellent work which she has presented and on her efforts in terms of overcoming the differences between us with regard to water .    3.346482272261905
the framework directive on water is a necessary initiative .    3.48975914713376
nevertheless , given that the idea of solidarity is central to the process of european construction , this directive must take into account the fact that water resources should be seen as a factor in social cohesion .    4.520154518545584
nobody doubts that water is a resource of interest to all of us .    3.692636112484145
however , in spain and the other southern countries , which have an unusual climate , the management of water resources require political action in order to rationalise their use and other cooperative measures .    3.973639004545298
therefore , we believe that this framework directive should advocate a use of water which allows us to overcome territorial imbalances and , to this end , i ask that you support amendment no 95 , which has been presented by our group .    4.079160426741918
we wish to ensure that article 1 of the directive promotes the sustainable , efficient , fair and UNK use of water .    4.1972091812974055
i am now going to briefly discuss the main issues on which the spanish socialist delegation differs somewhat from certain positions which have been expressed here .    3.4228331972904527
one example is water transfers .    2.7678891967546497
we would prefer the future framework directive not to subject the implementation of transfers to community supervision .    3.5371045455799286
in spain , a policy of full recuperation of water costs would clearly not have the same effect as in the countries of the centre and north of europe .    4.053938341315745
the spanish would see an increase in the price of water for its different uses , owing to the scarcity of water resources and the UNK of the environmental costs which will have to be met within the framework of the provisions of the directive .    3.9381991490084567
we have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs . this system should take good account of social , environmental and economic effects , and its implementation should be UNK in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions .    3.2664028319092973
we want to build a europe with a sustainable and healthy environment .    3.0912554402337182
however , an environmental europe cannot , in any circumstances , be built at different speeds , but must be built from a point of view of solidarity .    3.5533164942924045
mr president , the ecological disaster in the danube reminds us of how closely linked all the countries of europe are and how important water is to us all .    3.5613159155091685
discharges from chemical factories in my own constituency in the north - west of england will end up on the beaches of mainland europe .    3.247690746138108
this brings home the connections which bind us together .    2.8388301538528755
this framework directive is intended to paint the broad brushstrokes of the policy for the next decades and there has been much panic over the details .    3.6844822851724026
it is important for us to remember that this is a framework .    4.363955425678451
these brushstrokes are indeed very broad .    3.314455114584594
it is easy for individual countries , for individual sectors of industry , to escape the effects which have been painted to us in recent days .    3.7666392994498277
there are many opportunities to hide .    3.127646607098588
the reality is that the details of this legislation will be set out in UNK directives in months and years to come .    3.7350936799740353
that is the time to debate some of these problems of detail .    3.646420301701004
the broad principles are surely ones we should be able to accept - the broad principles that we wish to reduce hazardous waste leaking into the groundwater , the broad principles that we should be aiming to ensure that chemicals , which we all need in society in all circumstances , should not be finding their way into our water system .    4.203782067432158
there is a chemical factory in the north - west which wrote to me to say that we must vote against this legislation .    4.077164750584148
i would have to ask them what chemicals they are putting into the water supply at the moment and why they are not UNK to all the residents in that area exactly what they are doing .    4.156368316195393
this is something that they prefer to avoid doing .    3.0927037366457677
the principle also concerns water UNK .    3.1751267605802758
the basic understanding which many of us now share is that we need to introduce environmental taxation to encourage conservation , to use the UNK - and - stick approach to make best use of our assets so that we do not add to the pollution or loss of a valuable resource like water .    3.9836164994805885
i want to refer to the political position here .    3.2829740415197906
the common position has weakened the stand taken by parliament at first reading .    2.800022821437614
some of the ngos would say that the directive as now framed is worse than useless .    4.172588396458878
it is a retrograde step .    3.1081840653057298
this is an opportunity for us to improve the situation .    3.8321096767058416
we need to get ourselves into a position of conciliation .    3.388577272657391
we have seen vote after vote lost .    2.9734918469270677
measure after measure has come out of the environment committee .    4.633047190281404
we have failed to achieve a qualified majority .    3.63837264852338
our attempt to improve the environment of europe has failed .    3.7178832632282104
we need to get into that conciliation position .    2.933917750640867
we need , at the end of the day , to ensure that we end up with a sensible , balanced policy of real improvements at a reasonable cost .    3.3973631507615605
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as long as nearly thirty years ago , the european commission made attempts to draw up a european water policy .    3.2359410778688145
a hundred and twenty - nine chemical substances had to be regulated .    3.2739380819347055
eventually , standards were drawn up for only a dozen or so substances .    3.3884661596663257
the unanimity principle was at the root of this debacle .    3.404617244506585
some seven years ago , it still looked like the european water policy was going to be sacrificed on the UNK of subsidiarity .    4.239923767138428
the conservative government leaders messrs major and UNK decided in a UNK UNK UNK at the edinburgh summit that it was totally unnecessary for the spanish to receive drinking water supplies which were as good as those of the UNK or english .    4.390711205041413
this UNK is partly reflected in the common position which came about under british socialist presidency .    3.445771010610987
this is unusual , but most of these amendments are desperately needed to plug the holes .    3.1158514443531784
the dangerous chemical substances constitute a big leak .    3.339822851616282
the chemical industry and , unfortunately , the european commission and the council of ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance .    3.45616860188898
this is very time - consuming , and , more importantly , there is no acceptable level of pollution for dangerous chemical substances .    3.7050802343204166
only the background level of the ocean is acceptable .    3.3534463864502775
this is what is meant by the term " close - to - zero " .    2.8428536601223153
the commission already has a list of 32 priority substances , many of which have a hormone - deregulating effect .    3.8455649621289507
these are so - called UNK UNK and cause , even in extremely minimal quantities , changes in the gender of animals and even humans , as is more and more being ascertained by scientists .    3.796875142244831
this is why it is so important that the european parliament UNK itself openly in favour of the ospar objective of close - to - zero by the year 2020 .    3.2481132267600312
i would like to mention two substances from the commission ' s list : mercury and UNK , UNK to tbt .    4.093206326789699
on the bottom of the UNK sea , the values of mercury and tbt are higher than the ospar value , to wit , ten and one thousand times , respectively .    3.5504862103462353
the chemical industry and society as a whole have to learn to replace these dangerous chemical substances by UNK UNK , and if this is impossible , to apply them in closed systems .    3.9387689718618706
for the substance tbt , this means that it can no longer be used as an anti - UNK substance .    4.130763149079268
a sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides UNK .    3.6106416516366324
i would like to finish off by expressing the hope that the european parliament will pick up once again its green image and will argue in favour of the close - to - zero option for dangerous chemical and hormone - deregulating substances by the year 2020 .    2.9316219426516956
mr president , the european parliament has a crucial role to play in the development of the water directive .    3.2173739676544746
the council ' s common position is totally inadequate in a number of areas .    3.2785131363528066
therefore , our task is to make the requirements in the directive tighter and more concrete .    3.700180885876316
as members of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , we regarded certain principles as particularly important when we adopted a position on the different proposals .    2.9564668200652138
firstly , we think that the time - frame for implementing the proposed measures should be shorter than that proposed by the council .    3.892904429656415
we therefore support the proposal to reduce the time allotted for implementing different parts of the directive .    3.722039387595835
secondly , i should like the phasing out of UNK materials to be carried out consistently .    3.791270444952277
there should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented .    3.1232435631045012
the legislation should also have written into it the fact that the international conventions , such as the ospar convention must be respected .    4.550848054518295
thirdly , we should like a clear statement regarding the pricing policy .    3.3495864281354573
this means that the basic principle must be that the price should represent the real cost of the water used .    3.8411741988290973
nowadays , taxpayers often have to subsidise industry and farming .    2.991293392493633
the obvious point of departure for legislation should be that polluters or consumers pay , although exemptions would be permitted in extreme cases .    3.1699655297707046
fourthly , we should like exemptions from the rules on water status to be kept to a minimum and clearly defined .    3.808711867467908
fifthly , the protection of groundwater status and measures against persistent pollution of the groundwater should be transparent and clear .    3.502339529096857
against that background , our group is able to vote in favour of most of the amendments tabled by mrs lienemann , the rapporteur , as adopted in committee .    4.47757871255709
we should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended .    4.274964238690092
we will therefore vote for the greens ' amendments nos 102 , 103 and 104 , which we consider to be improvements on the present position .    3.464111433356729
as regards pricing policy , there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report .    3.4315501879477632
i cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned .    3.034456039710586
consequently , amendment no 107 , on the same question , has been tabled by one section of our group only .    5.104675104692725
mr president , every satellite UNK proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet , yet the UNK of water is an illusion .    3.8463586248228077
the recent disaster on the danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the UNK of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders .    3.692902352968198
water is a renewable but limited natural resource .    2.2211906273635473
it becomes UNK when it is UNK and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable .    4.247618063756215
in the eu , this is a crucial issue in the mediterranean region and also in other european countries where we are witnessing the gradual UNK of wet areas .    4.609800296716533
the increase in vulnerable areas , both wet and dry , inequalities between countries , inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic , economic , geographical and UNK events are all the evidence we need . however , these must not lead to competition distortions within the community .    3.5424893409389684
we have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water , given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land .    4.278661252802317
agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive .    4.138414093130859
it is not only in the member states that solutions to these problems are being sought . last october in UNK , the countries in the euro - mediterranean partnership UNK demanded a marshall plan for water for the south coast of the mediterranean .    3.890023230686975
we are not , fortunately , at this point .    3.3713747976529334
however , we are in europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods , which the directive underlines .    3.583709912015627
for example , france , the rhine valley and central europe recently suffered flooding .    3.0368545197680454
we need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other .    3.460284392579171
yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water .    3.4807203365701205
the water issue will definitely not be settled today .    3.279594682442069
in fact , the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects .    3.491675150996261
mr president , it is very likely that , during this century , good - quality water will be of even more strategic importance than oil .    3.425356985520446
this is enough reason to thank mrs lienemann for the efforts she has made to obtain sound surface water .    3.3524470736732783
it seems rather complicated to attain a proper european legislative framework .    2.938627447043761
with the framework directive on water policy , we are hoping to end the fragmentation of the eu ' s water legislation .    4.129786119418999
but that has not UNK us from the task of drawing up an extensive and complicated directive which will require great care in its implementation from the executive bodies .    3.576739209049086
more specifically , the possibilities for adopting a specific policy by member states and water UNK , which have been set up thanks to the catchment basin approach , need to be UNK .    4.058074181145174
the key goals remain the prevention from further pollution of ground and surface water , the protection of eco systems , the promotion of the sustainable use of water , the control of floods and droughts and the UNK of discharging dangerous substances into surface water .    3.658718345000822
as far as the discharge of these dangerous substances is concerned , i am of the opinion that the councils ' objectives lack both commitment and ambition .    3.0660697870809703
the committee on the environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close - to - zero is , in my view , to be welcomed and worthy of UNK .    3.8549616269249993
however , a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability .    3.3552540578288155
consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced , as well as UNK emissions which are difficult to control , and which pollute the water quite substantially .    4.042961690289706
mr president , we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect .    3.836303060921103
in the 20th century , water was merely a free UNK and disposal system for poisonous substances , special waste , chemicals and so on . and we can already see the consequences !    3.301826573758387
we need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation .    3.070686199766254
the directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the commission is planning here .    3.7280322569362925
in the final analysis , water protection is not just a social question , it is a decisive social question , which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences .    4.138361574833569
given the advanced state of pollution of water resources , it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements .    4.009575301521625
mr president , it must be some six years ago now that mr karl - heinz florenz , assisted by mrs UNK schleicher , put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety .    3.1636354635783404
it is not an easy topic and , in my opinion , the efforts made by mrs lienemann are very laudable indeed .    3.6496188223614547
the decision - making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage .    3.2521013787955426
the topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result , we have been able to draft important , more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading .    3.7304797595482384
in fact , the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal .    3.387981208677825
it is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge .    3.772127007417498
i would also address the spanish member in this respect : in the north of europe , we often face floods , but also polluted water , from industry , whilst the problem facing the members in the south is often related to transporting water over long distances , simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture .    3.818082877918747
i would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail .    2.9282284822870963
i would first of all like to focus on quality .    3.3804942624009042
the netherlands is significantly affected by the european water policy .    3.6610841027097587
a very important component , to wit , one third of our drinking water , is UNK from surface water in the netherlands .    3.939746083592311
the netherlands is located downstream , in a delta , which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance .    3.5498101618734776
another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .    3.0454780356388556
in a number of amendments , the proposed standards and especially the ospar standard for 2020 are called into question .    3.3659688338243607
although i understand that , according to some , this standard is unclear or that it cannot be defended judicially , i do believe that we have to support it because we could then provide more precise standards in a conciliation procedure .    4.500219640134805
i would now like to say a few words on quantity management .    2.742889045967213
in his UNK " UNK UNK holland " [ " UNK about holland " ] , a famous dutch poet mentioned water too , which , with its never - ending trail of destruction , was feared and respected .    3.219677234196206
in UNK , we suffered an enormous flood at a time when we were able to play a pioneering role in terms of dam technology .    4.333351169010158
when our rivers flooded in 1990 , we established that UNK artificial works upstream affects the water - storage capacity downstream and can cause a great deal of damage .    3.035546452554813
this means that in terms of quantity management too , we need to put in considerable effort to ensure that life upstream and downstream is not affected by it .    3.96114542016345
mr president , i too would like to start by congratulating mrs lienemann on her excellent work .    2.0473212903485813
water is a basic necessity of life and a fundamental right .    3.5827638986657457
everyone should have clean water at their disposal but the availability and good quality of water is not so self - evident , as many have experienced in southern europe and are experiencing now in the danube countries too .    3.968922051266316
water is often a source of conflict between countries and peoples .    3.450756288031583
this is why it is important that water becomes subject to international coordination .    2.8900009001542117
we need to recognise that water is a joint liability .    3.6706744894358074
cooperation within a catchment basin must be self - evident .    3.0327501697595043
too little operational capacity upstream or , in fact , excessive use , can cause problems downstream .    3.7557171593591177
coordination is the key word here .    4.063582855257573
the problem of water is becoming increasingly topical .    3.5885997619167203
changes in the climate and minor rises in temperature have a direct impact on UNK .    3.3415425150411187
some areas are becoming UNK , whilst many are becoming UNK .    3.4182097840696755
it is time for action .    3.0061086011253644
in march , the second world water forum will be held in the hague .    3.752725314139968
this forum stands for a worldwide vision .    3.2967436068482248
this vision must translate into regional action plans for sustainable water management and water control .    3.25433830975734
the time for action is upon us .    3.2728189073709166
the european parliament must now opt for a sustainable water policy as a starting point and remain realistic at the same time .    3.0433289191194564
but we should not lower our standards too much either .    3.2167555507192906
the common position is not ambitious enough .    2.805512759835988
this is why it is necessary to refer to previous international agreements , or the ospar objectives .    3.3669577290583335
this has been agreed for the marine environment and it is obvious that this agreement will also apply to other waters too .    3.732573973512452
the ospar objectives are now being drawn up .    3.8466208131992077
a list has been compiled , containing 400 substances which produce clear risks for the environment .    3.0669853675369247
it is both technically and economically possible to reduce the UNK of these substances to virtually zero and we need to opt for this once again .    3.974144333172185
needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding .    3.5649366849858626
countries downstream must be able to count on the fact that countries upstream meet the quality objectives .    4.2133049099839015
quality has a price , but pollution could well have a much higher price tag in future .    3.385034513411413
mr president , commissioner , my compliments to mrs lienemann on her excellent work on the water directive .    2.800028850241268
i should like to remind you that the very serious environmental problems facing us today in the shape of climate change , the depletion of UNK forests and overfishing , constantly affect our common and vital but , in some ways , UNK resources .    3.414026167390059
we should also recognise that , in europe , our fresh water sources may be said to be on the UNK between being owned by everyone and by no - one .    4.235751196500819
it is therefore strategically important that responsibility for water is established .    2.980170522945433
it is also important for the different watercourses to be kept together and managed as the totality they in fact are , irrespective of who owns one section or another of a common UNK .    3.374599408843985
ladies and gentlemen , the proposal for a directive does indeed , as many speakers have already said , represent an historic chance to simplify and improve the UNK of piecemeal eu regulations and directives and achieve a high level of environmental protection in europe .    3.401783497599814
however , i have the impression that the policy in the water framework directive is geared towards deregulation and renationalisation .    3.7303384009346194
i also hope that the vote will not be a UNK and that will depend on what i see as two quite fundamental points .    4.747459461144947
first ospar .    3.696463635596171
we know that the commission proposal does not go far enough ; unfortunately this also applies to the proposal by the committee on the environment .    3.6522253333943095
what we need is a completely legally binding objective for ospar .    2.742755040558828
only then will we manage to achieve legal clarity and , more importantly , objectives which are enforceable under the law .    3.0772513768762155
anything else will fall short of the mark and will not help to prevent ecological disasters , such as those which have just come to light in romania and hungary , from happening to us .    3.739254603374391
i find it unfortunate that national governments are not prepared to stand up for legally binding protection , despite having agreed internationally on ospar .    3.168729388877712
but i think that this is exactly what we have to make up for here in parliament , in order to demonstrate that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or compromised .    4.847642412719252
it is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .    2.788908002779568
we must not bow down before the agricultural or chemical industry UNK ; on the contrary , we must use our vote to promote and express that fact that we want the polluter pays principle and , hence , cost - covering prices .    3.3431885299903334
water is our most important resource and we must use our vote to ensure that the incentives and pressure are there to really comply with the ospar convention .    3.5621199297559327
with closed production UNK this is possible ; anything else would water down the directive .    3.2811893556231166
let us UNK our chance .    2.9662801381095014
mr president , in the small amount of time allotted to me , i would like to welcome the mrs lienemann ' s report and remind the house of three principles , to which all other principles must be subordinate , which are clearly expressed in the rapporteur ' s amendments : water is not a commercial product , but the property of all the peoples of the union ; the ultimate objective is to eliminate all pollutants in surface water and groundwater , and to inform the public so that it can participate in the recuperation of water and not use water excessively given that it is such a precious commodity .    4.520762455556019
i know that this directive may have problems , given the differing situations of the various countries of the union , as has already been mentioned .    3.930374072696661
the situation in the north is different from that in the south , and different from the situation in those countries which have the problem of desert areas .    4.853762323979045
i understand this .    2.917122003936415
however , there are some amendments which attempt to help the countries of the south , specifically amendment no 43 which , with regard to the recuperation of costs , also indicates that member states must take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when it comes to decision making .    4.059285842716936
there are also difficulties with the issue of transfers .    3.8391805684808484
in my country - i live in the north of spain - , there is a considerable difference between the north and the south , and difficulties arise when we have to transfer water from one place to another .    4.3957968316831435
however , mrs lienemann ' s report also says that the river basins receiving the transferred water must save and protect their water .    3.2644076563579913
i know that this is a difficult report and that the differing situations of countries cause difficulties , but we must move forward with a framework directive which will prevent a repetition of what is happening on the danube and what happened in doñana .    4.1155735275080225
we cannot allow our european water to be polluted , mr president , and we must produce a directive which will strengthen the political will of governments to preserve the resource of water , which is so precious to all of us .    4.418519810162223
mr president , my compliments to the rapporteur on a splendid report .    3.039612517235429
as an irish member of the european parliament , coming from a country which has large reserves of rich water , i support the vast majority of the proposals included in this directive .    3.9808313814094247
the latter has already brought forward its common position on this matter .    3.1172269623385858
according to the council the objective of achieving good surface water status should be secured no later than 16 years after the directive enters into force , whereas parliament ' s committee on the environment would like to see this deadline shortened to ten years .    3.669898929088879
i see no reason why european union member states cannot work to implement the key provisions of this directive in as short a time as possible .    3.878249808858379
i now turn to the amendments to be tabled before parliament tomorrow concerning the principle of the recovery of cost of water usage .    3.517036720949451
the council in its common position states that the european union governments must take account of the principle of recovery of the cost of water usage .    4.639241400683049
no specific target date for the implementation of this principle was included in the common position .    3.645725980714903
amendment no 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently .    3.7112008660856897
moreover , an adequate contribution from different economic sectors , broken down into industrial , household and agricultural sectors , must ensure that this policy is implemented .    3.3290096623459062
unless these amendments are supported tomorrow a strong message will be sent out that UNK and water rates should be implemented for UNK right across the european union states .    4.119937723868756
this is politically UNK from an irish perspective , as indeed it would be from the perspective of other eu member states such as portugal , greece and spain .    3.6529559141704944
mr president , i want first of all to say thank you to mrs lienemann for her report .    3.626465267158251
it is here and now that we decide to what extent the eu countries are to work effectively for a cleaner aquatic environment in the years to come .    3.8248348441895983
we can do this by , as a parliament , amending the council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment .    3.851459493587275
in its UNK form , the present directive could , in fact , have very unfortunate and long - term consequences for the environment and for our drinking water .    4.11161434012899
it would be to send out the wrong signals both to european industry and to the european people .    4.138359935302315
it is crucial to adhere to a limit upon total discharges of chemicals into our waters .    2.859960884006731
the directive quite obviously provides too extended a time frame within which time is to be spent measuring every single one of the approximately 100 , 000 chemicals in circulation .    3.5377582239128236
we cannot afford to wait .    2.7090662602832816
in this connection , i would ask parliament to support amendment no 108 , in which the words " water pollution caused by individual pollutants " are replaced by " prevention of water pollution through the continuous reduction in discharges " .    3.141055756207483
we cannot delay environmental work by going into inordinate detail rather than working on reducing total discharges of hazardous substances into the environment .    2.6869899036218445
the eu ' s ministers for the environment must therefore stand by their affiliation to the ospar convention , which now already defines what is hazardous to the environment .    3.5861459405769773
this convention should be our guide in working for the clean environment which we owe to ourselves and , not least , to our UNK .    3.424805452260876
mr president , it is difficult to summarise the areas covered by such a large and complex directive .    3.262934817290004
the treaty of amsterdam reiterates the priority criteria for prevention , for the implementation of the ' polluter pays ' principle and for sustainable development through an environmental impact assessment .    3.608132492318356
clearly , the importance of recognising the economic value of ecological factors in setting prices and making operators accountable through the adoption of incentives for non - polluting systems , seems unquestionable in the light of events that characterise the relationship between economic development and the protection of our environmental heritage , particularly our water resources .    3.6469347058990316
this situation is UNK echoed in many sectors of the economy , and especially in the agricultural sector .    3.5835855223082946
the concept of good agricultural practice has been introduced in amongst the complexity of the current relationships between agriculture , environment and water resources , and between positive and negative effects , and amongst the wide range of local realities and production systems and so on . this concept indicates which agricultural production method to use in order to satisfy the community expectation of an environmental protection of water resources that UNK basic standards , along with the subsequent costs and reductions in income .    3.5495781221022327
the obligation to develop and consolidate a strategy for integration UNK from this notion , with the aim of keeping the management of water resources at the heart of the sustainable economic production model in the light of current conditions .    4.167078350629557
we must not , with this in mind , pursue a strategy of separating the objective of preventing a deterioration in the state of surface water and groundwater from the objectives of protecting , improving and restoring their quality , as this would create a UNK hierarchy of priorities detrimental to the overall functioning of interventions and specific measures that target a combined approach and the use of the best available techniques .    3.580446248245521
as regards eliminating the pollution generated by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment , an optimum approach should provide a regulation at both national and community levels , which enables clearer identification of the various classes of bodies of water polluted as a result of human production activities .    3.2023592730522186
finally , we need to set up a system which prepares an objective list of potentially dangerous substances , using the increased information available on their chemical , physical and biological UNK , in such a way as to create an integrated model for intervention at a range of strategic levels in order to protect our water heritage , which is fundamental to us all .    3.6703212151078732
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , if we are to take the principle of sustainability enshrined in the treaty of amsterdam seriously , then our long - term objective must be to achieve zero inputs in our water because we need to safeguard water so that future generations do not pay the price for our water consumption .    3.5088620994167252
we can achieve this long - term objective by developing measures with demanding standards .    3.187634297168481
in this respect , i fully support the amendments proposed by mrs lienemann to develop a reasonable approach using quality standards so that we can eventually say that , when people use water , they are not consuming it but maintaining present stocks .    3.7323520556910688
this directive contains a number of very positive elements which are worth highlighting .    3.782865678927956
first there is wide information for and involvement by the public , a UNK in a european directive .    4.626661120827316
secondly , there is compulsory cooperation .    3.735906817919759
i am glad a UNK approach to water is being taken here and that authorities in the individual national states and beyond the borders of the national states are at last obliged to work together and ensure that water is of a high quality .    4.116929181063576
thirdly , i should like to address the question of the timetable .    3.6154586710924352
i am firmly convinced that we need a strict , tight timetable in order to work towards our long - term objective .    3.728300046017954
compare it with what happens in december .    3.563075767428126
we all know in december that christmas eve falls on UNK december and we start buying presents .    2.847609209493083
but what would we do if we knew in december that christmas was in thirty years ' time .    2.8996443373002747
we all know what we would do , which is why we need a tight timetable for our water policy .    3.6196766540175878
i emphatically support the rapporteur ' s proposals and think that we need a tight timetable for all areas of the directive , from the list of measures to the question of employment measures .    4.71044128738252
mr president , the purpose of the present objective ought to be to ensure that the member states work together to protect groundwater , drinking water and surface water and that the level of protection corresponds to existing eu environmental legislation .    4.442387302032968
may i take this opportunity to remind you that previous resolutions concerning the nitrates directive have still not been implemented in all member states , in spite of the fact that there is a common eu resolution .    3.4884831108196748
the present proposal UNK up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives .    3.597477240961536
it is proposed that a target should be achieved for concentrations in the aquatic environment which is close to the background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for humanly produced UNK substances .    3.091634089321675
this cannot be done , and it also , in any case , goes against nature .    4.654376322491529
adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the eu if concentrations of , for example , UNK and UNK could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for UNK in the aquatic environment .    4.230208132024816
european agriculture would not , for example , be able to grow bread UNK with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread .    4.96414607999812
as a result , agricultural production would move to other countries outside the eu , with consequent high socio - economic and employment costs .    3.3387237969650316
i cannot vote in favour of the sections in the water framework directive which deal with these states of affairs .    3.152679090595674
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , water is a precious raw material .    2.412679192421552
millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal .    3.2988472824895485
it should , therefore , not surprise us that water is the cause of wars .    4.077595453108534
the capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs .    3.6163773994950383
general interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation .    3.508511612596706
europe is therefore facing an arduous task ; that of combining a community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation .    3.4408398716428548
i have to admit that in UNK , where i come from , we still have a long way to go too .    4.071479637372509
we were recently UNK on the UNK by the commission regarding this matter .    5.0731413975763475
anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way .    3.9911957193749075
the common position is in this respect a farce , a document with no strings attached and a true UNK in the light of the ospar agreements .    3.88310180169331
the period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years .    3.305708339643044
by then , my children will be older than i am now .    3.413245999626424
you have to admit : this is a UNK .    3.738038793457398
tomorrow , we might opt in favour of a weak and UNK framework which UNK the future of our children .    4.098681334624228
either we opt for the amendments of my group , of the rapporteur or the committee on the environment .    4.400341893778095
i would like to finish off with this observation .    2.636422666070508
in the past couple of months , we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in belgium .    4.211535214258196
what was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the council of ministers .    3.235443187853758
in our own country , this pressure was UNK by both flemish and UNK environment administrations .    3.7326604018217697
i really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green environment ministers in my country are aware .    4.429819647768196
ladies and gentlemen , fine words are no longer sufficient .    3.394342244355154
we need to change tack completely .    3.0863242264257806
this can only benefit our credibility .    2.9765197224928115
the debate is suspended and will UNK at 9 p . m .    2.697554311714535
the dialogue on europe - institutional reform    3.1629255378184395
the next item is the commission communication - the dialogue on europe - institutional reform : the issues at stake .    2.650677407176265
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today . i am basically here to speak to you , as indicated by your agenda , on a new initiative which the commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform .    4.051232614130799
this reform must involve all the actors in european construction , with yourselves as meps at the forefront but also myself as a commissioner , the council ministers and national mps . it must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this european construction .    3.907017618398485
this morning , in the lengthy debate which i attended with mr prodi , many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the european institutions .    5.339964170756011
yet it is not just a question of who does what , as one of you said very clearly and forcefully .    3.7990529033065483
ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do .    4.1091199761215735
we must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future , particularly with the countries which will be joining us .    4.902698118871654
we too are concerned about this lack of democracy , and the commission has therefore decided to launch the ' dialogue on europe ' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people . this initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the intergovernmental conference .    4.5382255323023095
during the igc i will have the honour of representing the commission together with mr prodi and of working closely with your two representatives , mr brok and mr tsatsos . all the commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region , and not just their own , which in my case happens three or four times a month , to engage in direct dialogue with the public , and not just with the UNK or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course .    3.832203004482268
we also plan to establish direct contacts in universities , schools and factories , to meet the people , answer their questions and listen to them . in this way we will play our part , as will you , in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do .    3.868684765050192
we hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the member states and in conjunction with the european parliament .    3.5008432866194634
we also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments , local elected representatives , non - governmental organisations , socio - professional organisations and the media .    3.0494088071781724
opinion UNK , political groups and parties , meps and national mps , elected representatives , as i have just said , local authorities or national parliaments , the committee of the regions , the economic and social committee , organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved .    3.8220395419728335
need i remind you that the european parliament itself took the initiative on 1 february ? i must again thank mr napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are , of course , the representatives of the people in each member state .    3.9911865112743437
the commission will propose that the member states become involved in this exercise either as part of ad hoc cooperation or a more structured partnership .    3.8255726928414866
we are setting up a media plan and close contacts with the european union presidency and the european parliament .    4.119035637024499
i have indicated the conditions under which the commissioners will play their part through public meetings and visits .    3.0545089022684513
we want to encourage debate among the people .    2.963965639855668
without UNK to lecture you - god UNK - or even advise you , may i just point out that , when it was my honour to be minister for european affairs in my own country , i saw the need to establish a direct dialogue with the people ? each week , when engaging in this dialogue in each region , i realised that there was a real need for the european union to have a face .    4.360526338007404
i therefore took a european commissioner , and not just the french ones , or ambassadors posted in paris or meps to engage in this dialogue each week . this made me realise that people had many intelligent questions and that they needed to be respected , listened to and informed .    3.500148703833128
so this is what we are going to do .    3.7247452166699673
we will have a budget of approximately eur 4 million for 2000 which you will hopefully approve .    3.6433386856223247
financing from the 2001 budget must also be negotiated as we want this initiative not just to be an experiment but to last throughout both 2000 and 2001 . it will therefore be ongoing throughout the negotiation of the intergovernmental conference and the ratification process .    3.883132171668532
we will launch this dialogue on 8 march in brussels in the presence of 700 young commission UNK .    3.0750567402501847
your president , mrs fontaine , has agreed to take part with mr prodi and several commissioners in this initial dialogue . i can assure you that , whenever a commissioner intends to engage in dialogue , the most immediately available meps will also be able to take part in order to give their point of view and explain the work and role of the european parliament .    4.114832296335174
that is all i have to say for the moment .    3.919711651066214
i welcome any questions , suggestions or proposals from the members present .    3.1723092136344824
colleagues , you know the rules .    3.948169309233673
you are expected to ask questions , not necessarily make lengthy statements .    3.3965402276782513
you have one minute each in which to ask your question .    3.3173244274056994
mr president , i think i also speak for the committee on constitutional affairs that i chair , in expressing my appreciation of this commission initiative .    3.473845985547347
moreover , this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by parliament itself in its resolution of 18 november .    3.3528499715114233
i have also heard commissioner barnier ' s clarification of relations and links with the european parliament during the implementation of this programme .    3.8592679545388378
if i may make a suggestion , commissioner barnier , would it be possible for the communication to say something more on this subject , in addition to the straightforward and slightly clinical phrase which indicates that it will be carried out in conjunction with the european parliament ?    3.950765243156025
it would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because i can see a particular problem with coordination , specifically between the commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments , but also members of national parliaments - and our committee ' s programme . following the working meeting of 1 february , which commissioner barnier referred to and which benefited from the UNK contribution of the commission , the committee intends to take stock of developments at the intergovernmental conference at all of its meetings .    4.058286596817029
we therefore hope to benefit from the capable and consistent participation of members of national parliaments at all of our meetings , and this will be a channel which will ably supplement the ones in the commission ' s initiative .    3.841084106175795
thank you , mr napolitano .    3.0218345023524362
i can confirm that our proposal is completely within the spirit of the resolution of 18 november .    3.2069860158142607
i also want at this stage to say that i was able to propose this initiative to the commission thanks to the cooperation and understanding of my colleague , UNK reding . this initiative was also established in conjunction with UNK verheugen as it involves all the major challenges of enlargement , both its opportunities and risks , and of institutional reform .    4.206533992073761
these challenges must be explained to our citizens who are concerned about them and questioning them .    3.6942396453230195
i understand your concern , mr napolitano , and an interinstitutional working group will be set up . its first meeting should take place in march .    3.6690814633566875
you realise that making a success of this dialogue means work for everyone concerned .    3.473065634509846
mr president , commissioner , it is music to my ears to hear you use the word ' citizen ' so often .    2.779593871525169
we are increasingly concerned in this house about public opinion . the fear of public opinion is a rather UNK concept but our house is what it is and we must do what we can with it .    3.9958825929992154
in terms of the igc issue , i have a specific question for you . i believe that the court of justice in luxembourg is currently looking very closely at the important issue of the fight against fraud and olaf .    4.32823278743166
as you know , there are problems which not only concern this house but also the european officials who are also european citizens .    3.3892829819634613
given the urgency surrounding this issue , has the commission considered the possibility of completely changing the structure of the anti - fraud office by moving to a solution which would entail the fight against fraud , in the member states and in the european institutions , coming under the jurisdiction of the court of justice ?    3.9884291557286145
mr dupuis , first of all i attach a great deal of importance in my public life to the word ' citizen ' .    3.4783773656382353
it is one of the most wonderful words in a democracy and must be used .    3.6402031689672785
we will conduct this dialogue with our citizens , including the most disadvantaged and those isolated from decision - making or information centres .    3.7143602846756267
with regard to the igc and this issue of the fight against fraud , and specifically fraud against the community budget and interests , we have retained the idea in our proposals of creating a new and specific post of a european public prosecutor . we have done this in the spirit of this house ' s work and perhaps by going down the same road .    4.281774230053723
this public prosecutor would have the authority , recognised by the eu treaty and therefore by the member states , to investigate thoroughly any case threatening the community budget and interests .    3.8896825539608306
we can clearly and almost UNK see that legal cooperation is now no longer enough to fight against this fraud whether it UNK from inside or outside the community . this is why we have proposed the creation of a european public prosecutor who could , having investigated a case from start to finish , then have this investigated and ruled on by the most appropriate national court .    3.4194338972999474
in reply to your second point on the court of justice , we have not yet established our position on the court of justice because we were waiting for the UNK report which was published a few days ago .    4.231041431034526
the commission , as i have promised , will complete its proposals on the igc opinion about the legal system and the court of justice within the next few weeks .    4.158055444316135
i would ask you to confirm that , if an official has said that an austrian company is in some way excluded from participating in joint development projects , then this official has got the wrong end of the stick , and that , if he has not said this , then there is no story .    4.5061158344213315
will you confirm what is the case ?    4.645816426987541
mr haarder , to my knowledge no official has been authorised to say such a thing .    3.4342259627771266
my personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the austrian people , businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in austria of a new government coalition .    3.759526835403166
therefore , subject to verification which i or someone else will give immediately after this sitting , i can confirm what you have just said , that the commission has never said or authorised anything of this sort .    3.3703312575443083
generally speaking , there are other lessons to be learnt from what is happening in austria . i have myself suggested various possible responses to this challenge which serves to remind us all once more what we have been doing together since 1957 .    3.9755016746834317
this is an economic community , of course , but it is also , primarily , a community of values .    3.98487621472668
this is why we are drawing up a charter of fundamental rights which will more widely and more clearly protect our citizens on an individual basis . this is why we have article 13 of the ec treaty on discrimination which we proposed , in our opinion of 26 january even before the austrian crisis , should be applied after the igc by qualified majority rather than by unanimity .    3.356696092358633
this is why i personally have an idea to supplement article 7 of the eu treaty with a new paragraph which would give the democratic warning or monitoring procedure a legal basis . finally , this is why we have public debate .    3.8308340264836303
the only way to eliminate UNK ideas is to offer alternatives , which brings me back to the subject of our discussion . i firmly believe in the democratic force and value of debate , particularly to fight against demagoguery .    3.7158315391840446
commissioner barnier , you laid great stress in your statement on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of europe .    3.622126170220032
with reference to the igc , as you know , under the helsinki decisions the portuguese presidency was given the specific entitlement to add to the agenda of the igc during the course of the igc .    4.386104132213268
clearly , parliament has its own representatives present , mr brok and mr tsatsos .    3.210538624360063
but would you , commissioner , also be in a position to give an undertaking that if and when the agenda is enlarged by the council you would report this to parliament so that we could discuss it amongst ourselves and indeed with you , with the intention of continuing that dialogue with the citizens on which you have laid such stress ?    4.682019213787991
mr UNK , my answer is clearly yes but that is no surprise .    3.6155523069518325
mr napolitano , the chairman , and many other members of the committee on constitutional affairs and even more meps in this house know that , on behalf of the commission , i will be available to tell you how things are going as they happen throughout these negotiations , in a spirit of transparency .    3.981524333781785
i will perhaps say this differently from mr tsatsos and mr brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that , in many cases , we will say this together .    3.8484608681133707
it is very important that these negotiations is not UNK with the european parliament or the national parliaments which , when all said and done , will have their opinions to give and their positions to take in the ratification process .    3.788423598001276
this is why i congratulate mr napolitano ' s initiative for regular joint consultation between the national parliaments of the fifteen and the european parliament .    3.6393247701521494
having said that , the duty of transparency and debate starts here with regard to the reform of the institutions .    3.6421034476919014
i will therefore be available whenever you want in order to inform you of our positions and the progress being made in these negotiations throughout this year .    3.9970580368924105
mr president , firstly i would like to compliment the commission on its approach .    3.173860468811763
i think it is extremely useful to open up the communication channels with the citizen at an early stage . this did not really happen for the treaty of amsterdam or the treaty of maastricht and this has only led to a great deal of mistrust .    3.7115524671920044
i have two questions . firstly , you mentioned that you will start a two - way dialogue with the citizens and i am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the european commission .    4.087801831964142
do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well , that is to say via the television and internet ?    3.8065809541663014
my second question is of a critical nature .    2.686511732177596
the european commission has just issued a proposal on transparency .    3.5240642474069217
if i compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the netherlands , then the european model is UNK overshadowed by the dutch model , and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the netherlands .    4.05095035035949
mrs maij - weggen , given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the igc , it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now .    4.274163985108467
the group of representatives is currently meeting in brussels and i will try to join them as soon as possible .    3.5893662709917495
the documents will in the main be open working documents .    3.7371250730406738
although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the european council will not be open to the media , i am committed , as i must be at this stage , to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate UNK on these negotiations and the commission ' s viewpoint .    4.923466462042684
i can confirm , and thank you for having asked me about this , that we will use all the most modern means , television in particular , to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across europe .    3.705919452722361
we will open an internet forum and create permanent discussion forums .    2.8894772513498856
the commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised .    3.283188812389861
these are the modern means to be used .    3.57186413807557
however , i believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people .    3.310938807296199
although this may be a rather UNK ideal , i want a commissioner , when he can , an mep , a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of europe .    3.971891753897574
i have evidence that this is possible .    4.4087185305519725
the majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions .    3.0825307074451116
although this may seem rather UNK , i want the commission , in the minds of the people , to have a face and for those people forming the commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible .    5.000962499624628
mr president , i welcome mr barnier ' s commitment to go to the regions , both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say .    3.6620098015767444
i would like to invite him to my own region of yorkshire , a major european region that is a full UNK in the single european market and a major UNK of european structural funding .    4.122671854154664
he can come with both the hats that he UNK as a commissioner .    3.852218606180108
in some member states it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be .    4.457389199337635
that is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti - european movement and anti - european organisations that exist .    3.668558595972989
the commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign .    4.224471635903455
mr corbett , thank you for your comments .    3.1341534157324538
i willingly accept your invitation . if i have understood you correctly , you want me , when i come to yorkshire , to talk not only about the reform of the european institutions but also the structural funds .    3.8615071876392757
i can perform this dual task .    3.026168724946827
i forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments , as i have already done , not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in UNK .    3.9920356519788647
ten days ago i was in westminster , so you can see , mr corbett , that i am not afraid of the difficulties .    4.196366615138411
next week i will go to the UNK in berlin .    4.685608554948469
i have already appeared before the french senate .    3.0103518410209076
therefore , throughout this debate , whenever i can , i will go directly to see the national parliaments too .    5.122176519022011
with regard to the dialogue with our citizens , it is not a question of propaganda or marketing , nor even of communication .    3.8309465393610016
i want this dialogue to be a real dialogue . so , after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform , those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion .    4.043408530219272
i will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the member states . i sincerely hope , with your support , that the governments of the fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate .    4.151241173660466
mr president , i should like to join mr barnier ' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with .    3.122672512281637
it is not much fun , of course , having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself .    3.5631976756144357
in connection with the intergovernmental conference , mr barnier said , during his presentation in parliament , that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision - making but , when i look at page 63 , i see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say , the residence directives - , combating discrimination , the whole of social security and the renewal of regulation no UNK and , with a few exceptions , of arrangements in the socio - political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting .    4.360941229203935
is not mr barnier nervous about UNK the inner workings of the member states ' election processes ?    3.814585111076682
it is , of course , these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the folketing and other parliaments .    2.965938563178544
can such matters be controlled from brussels ?    3.40714809095946
is this an element in the radical decentralisation which mr prodi talked about this morning ?    3.3547786331066884
i was very glad to learn last week that the commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference , not merely to relations between the union and member states , but also the union , the member states , regions and cities .    4.776110468965024
i hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of europe , commissioner barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears .    3.222080896265003
commissioner , i want to go back to one of your previous answers . in this you mentioned what i would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the eu treaty against any risks of UNK and , in particular , the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a member state , pursuant to article 7 , for the violation of fundamental freedoms .    4.396080380159032
do you believe that these proposals , or proposals of this type , form part of the mandate of the igc as defined in helsinki ?    4.126869730608373
i do not think so .    2.233127632409612
are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion , unpopular opinions or UNK from the dominant european thinking ?    3.1573995745778847
yes , mr bonde , we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the commission .    3.9974096404437733
i believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated .    3.6161491182215557
in terms of social protection , i can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology .    3.5595691279521553
in your country , mr bonde , like everywhere else , i believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the UNK conditions of competition and movement of goods and people .    3.6672535908229418
this will therefore be our rule .    3.6764827211104896
we are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market . our proposal is not general or systematic .    3.7678004235104874
i am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues .    3.3749993058729704
i do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical .    3.990885160805064
this has never been the case . we are simply trying to ensure , in a europe with 30 or 27 member states , the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27 .    4.691680750236592
mr maccormick , i agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals .    3.6214915443134665
it must get as close as possible to the people , where they live and where they have their roots .    3.302126387781866
if i said anything different i would be UNK myself as commissioner for regional policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions . you will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people , where they live , to preserve their roots , traditions , soul and identity .    4.117386078735608
we will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions .    3.0772405936111493
mr berthu , the helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this .    4.12766235888406
it specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in amsterdam .    4.026650113409992
it also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the portuguese and french presidencies .    3.7525111428497
the commission is acting correctly if , on a particular point , it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions . i am not yet sure that we will do this on article 7 .    4.121863211504249
however , if we do , this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the union must mobilise together to give their response . we will also do this with regard for the future in general .    4.304960272922521
we will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the union in 1957 , and even before that , on the UNK of the second world war .    4.369257169508916
everything which can be done will be useful . i am sure that you and i , mr berthu , can at least agree on this .    4.102721171385108
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
you have answered the questions precisely and also opened the dialogue for europe that you referred to .    3.0272566703242276
you have set a very good example of time - keeping today .    3.593138844603348
that concludes the debate .    2.1467925807151658
question time ( commission )    3.377579036053499
the next item is question time ( b5 - 0009 / 2000 ) . we will examine questions to the commission .    2.1967422854477983
first part    3.4826430781408737
question no 36 by ( h - 0025 / 00 ) :    2.49105709237101
subject : high infant mortality in kosovo according to the latest un data received from the world health organisation , kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in europe ; almost 50 % of babies born prematurely die , while the war has produced a UNK rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm .    2.8328993946572547
in the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the union and the efforts of its envoy bernard kouchner , will the commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of kosovo ' s right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women , women in UNK and babies ?    3.5615817900005298
mr president , the commission is conscious of the very difficult situation concerning health and health facilities in kosovo , not just for pregnant women but across the board .    3.626238878209248
this results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it .    3.2282737876904632
the statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable .    3.2404485075807234
however , the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population .    3.56045216785529
the commission ' s response has been as follows : firstly , the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of echo funding .    3.7666892546222335
echo is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care , on support to institutions as well as vaccination .    3.59397947034364
however , efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self - sufficient healthcare system in the province .    3.4620840411932186
unmik has already taken a significant role in this field .    3.9816284567874614
secondly , under the reconstruction programme , urgent intervention at the hospital in mitrovica has already been initiated with a eur 1 million rehabilitation programme .    3.449590646074294
progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city .    4.088827564160722
however , the commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of unmik for this project .    3.596261398012259
we hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation .    3.212856883845609
under the european community ' s damage assessment , estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to UNK and health houses amount to eur 4 million .    3.6113550960724483
the commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds .    3.081708387316427
we expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system .    3.007804336933768
the emphasis will be on long - term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement .    3.9149611425485182
work is already under way with unmik to determine an appropriate contribution from the commission to this enterprise .    4.061997753615898
commissioner , this morning president prodi , among others , stressed that the balkans are testing our ability to act effectively , the very credibility of the european union is on trial , and the gap between words and deeds must finally be closed .    4.075151069363898
besides , commissioner , is so - called humanitarian military intervention justified by the present picture of human destruction in kosovo ?    4.088607159549957
do you think that so much UNK is UNK when , on the continent of europe itself , the right to life is at risk ?    3.975733777025609
i do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it , which have been working incredibly hard in kosovo , would regard it as an adequate description of their UNK to suggest that they had been standing UNK by .    3.808349204690605
i am sure the honourable member did not mean that .    3.6417726452310757
i am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance .    3.276863959558007
i would just make two points about the situation in kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along who lines .    3.722164588650759
first of all , i am sure that the honourable member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in belgrade UNK the health service in kosovo , and many albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all .    3.426993407745207
as a result of that , a parallel health care system was put in place through the mother UNK society .    3.296180892989707
secondly , and i am sure that the honourable member recognises this as well , some of the tragic stories to come out of kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child UNK during carriage of a baby , but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born .    3.6928491484964625
those were cases in which women who during the hostilities , or before the hostilities , UNK killed their own children .    3.2414217102999285
we are dealing with a UNK story in kosovo .    3.4031982253088593
we have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour , but it is not going to be easy .    3.9690287541564033
commissioner , i would like to thank you for your response to the member ' s first question and the supplementary question .    3.7290829423483958
however , i still have some contacts in kosovo who have informed me that food packages which are distributed by echo , among others , are often of inferior quality .    2.907445071709862
in some cases , there have been incidents of food containing UNK and such like .    3.165934885096047
are you aware of this ?    3.7686321728743284
are you prepared to act upon it ?    3.1842833778795723
this is my first additional question .    3.056623869743885
my second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in mitrovica .    2.7025373541448348
you are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the northern part of the city and that , given the tense situation , albanian kosovars do not have any access to this section at all .    3.7082926500698545
what does the commission intend to do in order to ensure that albanian kosovars too can get to hospital ?    3.097792678312611
on the first question , i am going myself to kosovo at the beginning of next month for another visit and i will certainly look into the allegation made by the honourable member about the echo food package .    4.239233094900216
i have not heard that suggestion before , but it is an important point and i will certainly investigate it when i am there .    3.742898673070549
secondly , i do understand exactly what the honourable member is saying about mitrovica .    3.5048172313675123
i was in mitrovica a couple of months ago , i saw the situation there for myself .    3.46748296805232
i had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities , including the leader of the albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently .    3.3463992459467216
so i know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and i can assure the honourable member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in kosovo , whatever ethnic group they come from .    4.502401924606531
the particular difficulties in mitrovica - for example , it is not just a question of albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital , albanian staff have had difficulty working there - are particularly acute problems .    3.3687842264054875
we will try to address them , but it is not easy .    3.796114678261439
question no 37 by ( h - 0029 / 00 ) :    2.558822822238649
subject : turkish blockade of armenia given that the european union is actively promoting social , economic and political relations with armenia through the partnership and cooperation agreement signed on 12 october 1999 , what steps is the commission taking to persuade the turkish government to lift the economic blockade of armenia ?    2.074478354215841
the commission supports any effort aimed at the settlement of the disputes between turkey and armenia and regrets that there has not yet been any normalisation of relations between these two countries .    3.3369577815896263
in the present political circumstances it is however unrealistic to imagine that the border between armenia and turkey , as well as the one between armenia and UNK could be opened without settlement of the nagorno - karabakh conflict .    3.1133251023733766
will it make it a condition that negotiations can only start if the blockade is lifted because , in the final analysis , we are all neighbours and we want to cultivate positive neighbourly relations inside the european union ?    3.845302719691549
my question therefore is this : will the commission make this one of the conditions in order to improve future discussions ?    5.012772504566534
the key issue is to support the efforts of the osce UNK group to find a settlement to the nagorno - karabakh conflict and we stand ready to help in any way we can .    3.3628288148840446
we have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the tacis programme to armenia .    2.895981520369283
let me relate my answer specifically to the question of turkish accession to the european union .    3.2275095279586785
the situation of turkey ' s relations with its neighbours will , as the honourable member asks , be closely examined in the framework of the pre - accession strategy .    3.5386072561666424
as stated in agenda 2000 - and i quote : " enlargement should not mean importing border conflicts " .    3.6433879897863974
that statement could not be much clearer .    3.9822732013304507
but i repeat that the most important contribution we can make is to try to assist in the resolution of that conflict which has had such harmful economic and humanitarian results .    4.284327662550445
question no 38 by ( h - 0040 / 00 ) :    2.464708973503667
subject : implications for human rights of the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey given that turkey has recently been granted applicant country status , what is the commission ' s view of the implications for human rights of the construction of the ilisu dam , given the massive displacement of the UNK and the other people of the region that will result ?    4.08266407175715
the commission has no information regarding the impact of the construction of the ilisu dam on the population of the region .    3.200358502242585
we will , however , consider raising the matter with the turkish authorities , together with other issues concerning regional development policies in the framework of the new pre - accession strategy for turkey .    4.227651629189705
i have a related point .    3.0698590254711706
it concerns the implications of the dam on access to fresh water in the region as a whole .    3.7864067509027546
as you know , the dam will limit the supply of fresh water to syria and to iraq in particular .    2.803888627908938
given the extreme volatility of this region and given the very real concerns of many UNK that we will see an increased incidence of conflict , of so - called " water wars " , in the coming decades , what is the commission ' s view about the potential destabilisation , both in turkey and in the wider region , that will be caused by this dam ?    4.505979390484366
can you say whether you will indeed raise this point as well ?    3.1200517908554457
we will certainly raise the point made by the honourable member .    3.242470309114694
we have heard anxieties expressed on that point and i will ensure it is taken up .    3.406851933317722
we will raise that , too , in the representations we make .    4.553480200245877
a number of other UNK - electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in turkey have raised matters of concern , such as the effect on displaced farmers .    3.395291021357389
on the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and i hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the commission is participating in any form .    4.784876475215926
question no 39 by ( h - 0036 / 00 ) :    2.422318860768212
subject : drafting of charter of fundamental rights the general public welcomes the fact that a charter of fundamental rights is to be drawn up . it is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of europe in the 21st century .    2.7017169638851977
what are the commission ' s views on the substance of the charter ? what type of rights will the charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ?    2.2081301506687523
which citizens will it cover ( those of the european union or the citizens of all european countries with a view to enlargement ? will it cover immigrants etc . ? )    2.425971910808594
will it set out established social rights in the european union or will it set a broader agenda ?    2.4165968695374707
what means will the charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?    2.278789256186407
according to these conclusions , the charter must contain three categories of rights . the first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights , as guaranteed by the european convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .    3.518318148182887
the second is the rights reserved for citizens of the european union . the third is economic and social rights , as contained in the european social charter and the community charter of the fundamental social rights of workers , insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the union .    4.290054151335188
the commission considers that the convention responsible for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights must respect the mandate given by the cologne european council .    2.9505847187925975
having said that , this does not mean that the convention should be limited to a UNK role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources .    3.535992314970878
as i have said before in this house , the commission is convinced that the convention must be able , if necessary , to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances , particularly technological and social changes .    4.158747493232071
however , given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the heads of state and government , this power must be exercised with caution and on a case - by - case basis .    3.1880740713011315
the rights conferred by this charter will have at least two types of beneficiary .    3.4740521320975457
it may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the european union and third - country nationals meeting certain conditions .    3.5527361981052077
it is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the charter to prejudge its content in more detail .    2.977002174981927
however , i can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future european charter of fundamental rights . this is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the ec treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the member states .    3.35721941247239
as i have also said before to this house , the commission is favourable to UNK the charter in the eu treaty .    5.116648264333314
however , we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the heads of state and government .    3.605214113925168
the difficult part , which will fall to the convention , is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the treaties .    4.406181589986114
in its opinion on the holding of an intergovernmental conference to amend the treaties , the commission noted that the european council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the igc agenda , in particular the european charter of fundamental rights .    4.235059651677825
commissioner , it is quite significant that at the beginning of this new century people in europe , men and women , are being called upon to redefine their rights and obligations .    4.22424425766897
we hope that this important cologne council decision will become a reality .    3.1521209115083235
globalisation on the one hand and enlargement on the other , make it urgently necessary to define those rights .    3.951724065852809
seattle is a real source of concern in that context and we hope that the european council in nice will not be a wasted meeting .    4.41754357384906
but if we are to secure the public ' s participation in this new planning , we would like to learn what plan the european bodies and specifically the commission are proposing as the social and democratic model of europe in the twenty - first century .    3.6194655133350273
i listened to your general guidelines and i would like to ask you what is the position of children , as entities in their own right , in the commission ' s plans for the new model of society in the twenty - first century .    4.164222908525908
mr president , mrs kratsa - tsagaropoulou , in my opinion , and as mr prodi said this morning , the drawing up of the charter is an exercise with great political significance . this is because it shows that the union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project .    4.05041235274128
in this context , the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated .    3.4532360044760275
the essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the european institutions , as contained in the european project enshrined in the treaties of the european union .    4.668724474083989
i understand your concern about the rights of children .    3.1427255282319333
many elements of our work , and particularly of my work as commissioner for justice and home affairs , involve protecting the rights of children .    3.916644593910521
this is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully .    3.186701734686637
each member state is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children .    3.0056671865276683
as for the eu ' s responsibility , the rights of children must be recognised in the charter according to the areas in which the union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship , in its broadest sense , of children .    3.9844760679296747
i hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable member has posed for the commission and the whole convention .    3.807897787997528
mr president , i have had the privilege of hearing the commissioner a number of times on this issue and i very much agree with his approach .    3.709279645770784
however , i should like to ask a slightly different question .    2.9193291679943054
we have just heard commissioner barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the commission towards the major issues that the community is dealing with this year .    3.9603133966503083
it is very important that the people feel engaged in this process .    3.3155652423668336
will the commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate ?    3.5290051386212236
it is the policy of the commission to promote an open and wide debate on the charter of fundamental rights , not only with non - governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far - reaching as the charter is .    4.4057920930023755
i can assure you that the commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future charter of fundamental rights .    3.294602094480798
there is no contradiction between the two .    2.9693169560818142
the challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the charter .    3.860030589758274
i am very glad to know that i can count on your support here .    3.183284806774806
question no 40 by ( h - 0095 / 00 ) :    2.483904165342808
subject : articles 6 . 1 , 7 . 1 and 7 . 2 of the treaty on european union article 6 . 1 of the treaty states that the union is based on principles of liberty , democracy , respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .    3.4019430060015687
it is clear from statements over the past years that jörg haider and the freedom party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in austria .    3.1333841303672365
therefore , will the commission state when they intend to propose under article 7 . 1 that there is ' the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a member state of the principles mentioned in article 6 . 1 . ' , and urge the council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this treaty to austria including the voting rights of the representative of austria in the council ?    3.7369450748149915
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the commission with regard to the formation of the new austrian government . this was reiterated this morning in president romano prodi ' s speech on that government which includes ministers from jörg haider ' s freedom party .    3.213700228089442
i am referring , of course , to the statement made by the commission on 1 february 2000 , the basic elements of which i would like to restate .    4.715315403779947
the commission confirmed then , as it does today , that it shares the concerns underlying the portuguese presidency ' s statement of 1 february 2000 .    4.139626809229168
these concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them .    3.6863624590448736
there is no need for me to remind you of jörg haider ' s political UNK and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements , which are also anti - european .    3.891598469699579
the fact that an openly extremist , racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a member state of the european union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other states that are taking part in the european project . the european commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either .    4.46519466713717
secondly , the commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the treaties , specifically with regard to articles 6 and 7 of the treaty on european union .    3.1562354790028118
one of the most important innovations provided by the treaty of amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the member states . another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled , and which would react if any of them were violated .    3.7858813641714586
the commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars : that of the rule of law .    3.5122893470481684
this principle means that the commission must act within the limits laid down by the treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 february was made .    4.825864058161941
the commission is not a state . it cannot and must not act as if it were one .    3.6402817966544827
in order to give a precise answer to your question , mr ford , i must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by article 7 . 1 of the treaty on european union to be applied , there must be proof of the existence and i quote , of a " serious and persistent breach by a member state of the principles mentioned in article 6 . "    3.7305627968710238
i repeat , a " serious and persistent breach " is the condition necessary for the commission to be able to propose to the council that measures be adopted against a member state .    3.646295364804656
i think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in austria .    3.6788261569352585
as a matter of fact i think that i am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled , either in austria or in any other member state .    3.831445712937587
i would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the commission , as stated once again by president prodi this morning , to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in article 7 .    3.643884081807925
i would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary .    3.0256653577142782
the values at stake are too central , too fundamental for us to accept UNK or compromises .    3.635691856532773
individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say .    3.8847963589780488
in austria ' s case , the statements are contradictory to say the least .    3.844874211932235
on the one hand , any of us could pick up on a whole UNK of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the freedom party .    2.989463332117724
on the other hand , the new austrian government ' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights .    3.3642835003603504
we will soon have our first opportunity , and an excellent opportunity it will be , to see which one of these two faces of the freedom party is the real one .    4.66193368659153
i am referring to the position the austrian government will adopt at the council with regard to the commission ' s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives .    4.119894052633762
one applies to the principle of treating people equally , without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin . the other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin , religion , handicap or sexual persuasion .    3.058785505878248
these are significant texts , adopted in accordance with article 13 of the treaty , which gave the community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race , ethnic origin , sex etc .    3.1057026177815428
lastly , i would like to assure you , mr ford , that the commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities , should it prove necessary .    4.064925407343137
i thank the commissioner for his reply to my question .    2.827003612305985
but is commissioner vitorino aware , not only of mr haider ' s and the freedom party ' s words , but also of their deeds ?    4.275364952298009
mr haider has actually been in government in the southern province of carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the slovene - speaking minority in that region who are austrian citizens , where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the roma and immigrant communities .    3.2535311666751463
could the commissioner answer two questions .    3.0905012141200374
can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ?    4.049705889118394
secondly , does he not agree that were the current government , at a national level , to pursue the kind of policies that mr haider and the freedom party have pursued at regional level , then there clearly would be a breach of article 6 ( 1 ) of the treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the commission to take the necessary action ?    4.555425329456854
we are not talking about words here .    2.7376818900916873
we are talking about deeds by the freedom party and mr haider .    3.3235267200387995
it is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the member states according to the procedures and standards that are enshrined in article 6 and justify the use of article 7 of the treaty .    4.085660720033079
therefore i am fully confident that the commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in austria , as in any other member state .    3.5214027809098534
if any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one member state occurs , we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly .    3.775306818093791
i also rely not only on the cooperation of the members of the european parliament , but also on the cooperation of non - governmental organisations , which have always made an important contribution to the anti - discrimination policy of the commission .    3.9438584891924937
regarding the situation in carinthia , we need to look at this in detail .    4.593584328234732
the protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the commission has put before the council .    4.362537734777468
we should not only focus this debate on the austrian question .    3.678429229634645
that question calls for reflection , for debate and , if necessary , for action .    3.610287717244662
i sincerely hope that all member states will take the opportunity of this action plan and these two directives that the commission has presented to the council to reiterate in clear and concrete terms their approval for the action plan and for the directives and their commitment to fight against discrimination , racism and xenophobia wherever it might occur .    4.354706737711968
thank you very much , mr vitorino , for your valuable contribution to this question time .    3.1315036991430225
second part    3.4079218452523494
questions to mrs wallström    4.224603680439198
question no 41 by ( h - 0021 / 00 ) :    2.542360669044539
subject : surplus electrical and electronic equipment each year the european union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment ( 6 million tonnes ' worth in 1998 ) , mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent .    3.2146811335026086
the environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances ( lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent UNK , pvc and UNK flame UNK ) .    2.9142246000626963
a preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions , the most recent of which dates from july 1999 .    3.4839108321351606
can the commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft , which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998 ?    3.3703745710641284
is it true that the us government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the world trade organisation ( for infringement of article xi of the gatt and article 2 ( 2 ) of the agreement on technical obstacles to trade ) if it is adopted ?    3.6202132633702373
the commission agrees with meps that the current method of dumping electrical and electronic waste is causing major environmental problems .    2.9944229106282796
consequently , the commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and , since 1997 , has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned .    4.533408303208286
the outcome of the discussions , as well as of the in - depth investigations which are being carried out in this area , are now being examined by the commission .    4.483559693132155
some parts of the proposal have been criticised , among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants , as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .    3.330072111109013
the united states ' delegation to the european union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper , inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned , as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers ' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste .    4.2230653225405375
the main argument put forward by the united states in this context is that the present provisions are , they say , incompatible with international trade law .    4.484160047100397
the commission is currently carefully reviewing the united states ' arguments .    3.1842263627210055
i should just like to add that my intention is that the commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before UNK .    3.3601323203906537
my question specifically concerned the reaction of the us government to the text of the preliminary draft .    3.4531842102821697
there have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one , to my knowledge , dating from july 1999 .    3.244426664191976
is this the text which you will be submitting , or an amendment to the original version ?    4.395047183988767
version 3 is already much weaker than version 2 following the comments of us industry as relayed by the us government .    3.250102331871029
i note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible , you are referring in fact to the rules of the world trade organisation .    4.297654510505189
the arguments of the us government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the wto rules .    3.757480565870926
this worries me because this means that , when adopting texts , we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the world trade organisation . this will fundamentally weaken european environmental legislation and particularly this proposal .    3.863128559222763
thank you for the follow - up question .    2.9690209977000594
it is important for me to have a chance to answer it .    4.119599793493151
it is clear that in a process such as this , where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in europe , there is an on - going dialogue between the different parties concerned .    4.239020867846169
the dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal .    3.500082426506965
parts of it have been strengthened , but other parts may well contain too many compromises .    3.351852851595075
we are still in the process of preparing a text , and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment .    4.55059401904601
i do not think that the intervention of the united states should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations .    3.4585367728462484
i strongly oppose using the wto and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the eu from introducing radical environmental standards .    2.971451810441849
i start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these .    4.327822869970155
however , i do want to listen to all the points of view .    3.5247324880773934
for example , i recently met representatives of the UNK industry who put forward suggestions - including practical ones - for improving our own proposal .    3.3213364373895744
however , i totally reject any suggestion that i would allow the united states to determine the shape of our directive .    4.080468864422487
in fact , i believe that we should be showing the way , an intention that will also characterise the final proposal .    3.3958753884230535
question no 42 by ( h - 0026 / 00 ) :    2.515728950507552
more women in decision - making positions on various environmental bodies would extend the predominantly male terms of reference beyond business alone to embrace social justice as well .    3.011640253903195
is the commission prepared to adopt an action plan to increase the active participation of women in decision - making in the environmental field ?    3.713087742225382
in 1988 , the commission introduced an action plan to promote equal opportunities for women and men .    4.30732119030345
through the current programme , which covers the period 1997 to 2000 , we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender - specific needs are taken into consideration .    4.014985975312587
one of the programme ' s aims is to develop and supervise methods , strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision - making process and in positions of responsibility .    3.2937075094123873
within the framework of the action plan , each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures .    3.589086927970506
one of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions .    3.1713492446060214
the new commission ' s own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office .    3.98416220389044
the same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the directorate - general for the environment , where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women .    3.073957228922428
our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions .    3.7984041300746973
currently , women hold 24 . 5 per cent of our a - grade posts , and we hope the number will increase steadily .    3.6684278751865578
moreover , we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups .    3.8371145497017087
as regards our external partners , all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to UNK their decision - making processes .    3.836246296947224
with respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality , as you know , this principle is included in the treaty of amsterdam .    3.6195807298027076
article 3 of the treaty states that , in all the activities referred to in this article , the community shall aim to eliminate inequalities , and to promote equality , between women and men .    4.6569331833227
the commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field .    3.5127838047645987
i should , of course , like to take this opportunity to say that i appreciate the role played by the european parliament ' s committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities , particularly its chair .    3.1590879833893455
i should just like to recall that , during the lengthy process of approving the present commission , every commissioner was questioned by the women ' s committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field .    3.623496581404714
we shall be monitoring each commissioner carefully , so the other commissioners have now been UNK .    3.572549998671414
thank you for your reply .    2.2516137870648967
i interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields .    3.4576379337262555
i should also like to point out that the beijing declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes .    3.0577769918067483
environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work .    3.1609884010076104
i naturally want to know whether the commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes .    4.1996804203979
this is a crucial goal .    2.9588835219742116
in order for all policies to be similarly UNK by the concept of equality , it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required .    4.669493021208485
.    2.4274255028413507
( sv ) my understanding of mainstreaming is , of course , that this should characterise everything we do .    3.8529097579422995
in the action plan prepared by my directorate - general , issues of equality play a very important role .    3.769248771562627
for example , i am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the commission .    3.4864419111979292
if we are to be able to motivate everybody , i believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or , if you prefer , from the bottom up .    3.960652004790904
my impression of environment - related work , broadly speaking , is that in many instances it is dominated by women .    3.781922063197572
this state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high - ranking positions in the environmental field .    3.2675746136844945
i should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention , but there is certainly room for improvement .    3.350881089726849
i have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up .    3.143245430899298
i hope that this will be of benefit .    3.046210870678857
question no 43 by ( h - 0045 / 00 ) :    2.708428266846873
subject : the boyne estuary and the drogheda port company the boyne estuary is designated a special protection area ( spa ) under the wild birds directive and is under consideration for designation as a special area of conservation under the habitats directive , as it is an area of international importance .    2.098569891712945
however , the department of the marine , UNK county council and drogheda corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the spa and even the elimination of a mudflat at stegrennan recently added to the spa specifically at the commission ' s insistence .    3.5040448452353696
what is more , a very large warehouse has been constructed , in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the drogheda corporation .    3.5467258745837875
how can the commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the structural funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area ?    4.012865568904409
is the commission ready to suspend funding completely , pending a review of the development plans of the area ?    3.3958052063248227
the commission is aware of the construction of the harbour , but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable member .    3.7422573581892826
the harbour construction project is receiving support from the structural funds and chiefly involves UNK the river boyne estuary and UNK the UNK on the mudflats at stegrennan .    3.753675635204139
the boyne estuary is designated a special protection area under the wild birds directive .    2.5317306028772344
that means that any development that takes place in or near the boyne estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the community ' s habitats directive .    4.118916170235367
since 1998 , the commission has received a number of complaints UNK that the harbour will damage the mudflats at stegrennan , which are now designated a part of the special protection area , and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed .    4.944747970234811
after UNK these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the structural funds - the commission became convinced , in the summer of 1999 , that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour .    4.040073645468562
an in - depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out .    3.3605333621945537
the most serious harm caused by the project , the damage to the stegrennan mudflats , was only to be temporary , and the UNK were liable for completely restoring the mudflats .    3.9570237416312586
at the commission ' s suggestion , the mudflats at stegrennan were formally included in the boyne estuary special protection area , from which they had previously been excluded .    3.6199333822846604
furthermore , to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats , the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved .    3.133081899564652
however , since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute .    3.2862305232885993
firstly , the irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements .    3.242875992696535
they then renewed their commitment after an irish non - governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the irish courts .    2.786683428545302
however , the new commitment included some minor changes which , in turn , led to a further complaint .    3.549737655655571
in view of the fact that the irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved , the commission will not , for the present , propose that financial support from the structural funds should be suspended .    4.290184188066832
however , it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the irish authorities , particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the irish courts .    3.3180710663728834
- i do not quite understand what the commissioner said .    4.695104391478405
the mudflat at UNK , which was made a special protection area at the request of the commission , has been completely destroyed at this stage .    4.179150251976423
it is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of eu directives .    2.8867650821497435
you say there will be no further funding .    3.5574290488521485
i would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation .    3.6856736185314265
if not , why not ?    2.4668352110934655
if you are , when exactly are you going to do it ?    3.8319900219238563
is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence , and also the authority which basically takes the money from the eu and gives it to a company that it owns 100 % ?    3.5508075365088234
is this right and proper ?    3.6823998894077925
what is your opinion on that ?    3.1007598827212024
any eu funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of eu directives .    3.784665554268481
even the area designated by the commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed .    3.252290147062825
compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done .    4.366698856652293
as a result , the irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means .    2.790336000851233
the use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what i referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically - harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary .    3.495970134975179
there is to date no UNK outcome to this legal challenge .    3.5464100546238484
the adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities , and does not require prior commission approval .    4.130251853482737
the commission ' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the birds directive are fully met , and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging .    3.7864319060568743
in this case , the commission proposes to seek further clarification from the irish authorities on the up - to - date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass .    3.2072833916495997
we are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the structural funds .    3.5365836791864638
mr president , sadly , the specific case raised by mrs mckenna is not an isolated one .    3.194970296514338
there are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of eu funding .    3.176532324846571
will the commission consider issuing instructions to all member states saying that , if in future it UNK that european environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out , it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted , in other words , UNK the money from the member states ?    4.285449644283953
it is only such action which will UNK this practice in the future .    3.389928714346945
.    2.4274255028413507
( sv ) this is a very important question .    3.9149233264037053
as meps are well aware , in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the commission , UNK UNK and monika wulf - mathies concerning the relationship between the structural funds , money from the structural funds and protection under the habitats and birds directives .    4.413571173071733
the message contained in the joint text is still valid .    4.110514906631144
we cannot hand out money with one hand and , with the other , take countries to court , where they may well be UNK . it is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy .    4.563747456032572
the result may , of course , be some difficult questions of priorities .    3.4217289910202298
then we will be in a position to carry out UNK monitoring and follow - up procedures .    3.665709687826502
in that respect , ireland falls short , like other member states , but we hope that the pressure we are UNK will produce results .    4.136474773358351
i should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good .    3.2076644202421907
the rules of procedure do not allow this .    3.271592150182504
you will have to discuss this outside the chamber .    3.7939319541595644

question no 44 by ( h - 0020 / 00 ) :    2.5586866524203873
subject : partnership arrangements and the third community support framework for greece the recent regulation ( ec ) 1260 / 1999 laying down general provisions on the structural funds places greater emphasis than the previous regulation on stronger partnership , involving the regional and local authorities and other public bodies , the economic and social partners and all other relevant bodies not only in the preparation but also in the funding , monitoring and assessment of the measures taken .    3.4524774974278074
however , local authorities have repeatedly expressed the view that ' partnership ' arrangements under the new csf for greece have remained unchanged and are singularly lacking in substance .    3.043284592794507
has the greek government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies ?    4.098344283712053
in what way have the local authorities be given a greater say in the preparation and administration of the third csf and what steps will the commission take to ensure greater participation by the ' partners ' in all measures taken under the new csf ?    3.7955128469020427
may i quickly add something to the answer given just now by mrs wallström to mr martin ?    3.145459768754398
this was a joint letter between our two predecessors and i consider , as the successor to mrs wulf - mathies , that this letter is still valid . i will actively endeavour with mrs wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the structural funds with the eu environmental directives and policies .    3.709450077206234
turning now to the question posed by mr alavanos , who i hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject , the commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor , during the preparation of the new programming period , the application of the partnership principle .    4.3472450802497855
the involvement of regional and local authorities in the community ' s action is , as you know , one of the essential elements of the new post - berlin structural funds regulation .    4.173886444763191
with regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next community support framework for greece , the commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the greek regional development plan for the 2000 - 2006 period .    3.8275976484441045
mr alavanos knows that i have been to greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster . during these visits , i held discussions with the greek government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement .    3.512387504494889
as for subsequent phases , in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes , it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level . it must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the csf at national , regional and local level .    3.8001038170509958
as for the monitoring and management of these programmes , i have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the greek government pursuant to article 8 of the new regulation .    4.535840825346762
within the third csf , this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee .    4.018253140729984
this is all i can say .    2.7507584056170247
i thank the commissioner , and do not at all question his intentions and interventions , which adopted a positive line .    3.469410913914311
however , things are really quite different .    3.2177962079297218
i cannot show you the television programmes here but i can show you the greek newspapers from a few weeks before the elections .    3.098649774426135
in the UNK papers all over greece : the ministry of public works concerning the structural fund : the minister ' s work ; the ministry of agriculture : the minister ' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the ministry of telecommunications : the work of the minister for telecommunications ; the ministry of education : the work of the minister for education and a photograph of the minister ; the ministry of employment : the work of the minister for employment , a photograph of the minister and a photograph of the state secretary , and behind them all the symbols of the community support framework .    3.369934259303458
there are only a few weeks to go before the elections .    3.1196930478286506
this is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates , financed by the european union , the csf .    3.51092038404669
will the commission remain silent ?    3.1625909617435704
will it discuss the matter ?    3.247478010810947
will it bring it up with the greek government or will we persist with the UNK situation we had with the previous commission ?    4.234496561978099
mr alavanos , i see that you have thrown to your left all the documents which you have just cited .    3.7924770993817125
would you let me have these documents so that i can read them , after i have had them translated ? i can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication , which i can only welcome as the commissioner for regional policy , and what is propaganda .    4.701829321551101
then if it is really necessary for me to do this , i will make comments or recommendations to the greek government .    4.70200033848475
i would therefore be very pleased if you could pass me these documents or i will come and get them from you later on .    3.1787611885470253
having said that , i thought your question related more to the partnership issue .    3.4049974724607104
further to your questions on the pre - electoral period , i can only repeat my intention that local and regional authorities should be involved together with non - governmental organisations .    3.392391800428514
subsequently , if i need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised , then i will do this .    4.543321541910014
i cannot do other than work with the greek government .    3.0287319905682337
i think that my colleague mr alavanos will be giving all these UNK to the commissioner so that he may be aware of them , because this really is propaganda and not just some way of promoting community programmes .    4.441746701130163
however , turning to the substance , i should like to ask the commissioner to bear in mind the following : that for all national and regional programmes , greece is regarded as a region which expresses itself - at the level of its partnership relations with the european union - via its central administration , its central government .    3.6482567070743683
from that point of view , neither local governments and much less non - governmental organisations , for example the farming UNK which would be interested in further development of the farming sector , have any involvement in the formulation of proposals for the third community support framework , nor have they had any involvement in the previous csfs .    3.6010306318461436
what can the commission do about that ?    2.9738618261262784
mr UNK , i can only repeat what i said to mr alavanos .    3.3731415883459106
i will monitor this situation very closely . if necessary , within and pursuant to the structural funds regulation , i will make comments on the use made , not of structural funds which are not yet committed , but of the negotiations prior to the allocation of these structural funds .    4.398802603449371
however , i am obliged to respect the national authority with which i must conduct these negotiations .    3.449319355455535
having said this , i will look at the situation objectively .    3.550081577350032
as for the rest , if you have any recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of a particular structure - i think you spoke of a cooperative structure - i am ready and willing , on the basis of suggestions from meps - you will be acting within your role and i within mine - to relay these suggestions , provided that they respect the spirit and letter of the structural funds regulation .    3.7722406936789326
why would i not say that we have noticed in previous years , on the part of the greek government , some shortcomings in the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society ?    4.813787466260267
i am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted , this must be remedied .    3.2548085532916513
i will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new community support framework .    3.7566553241193033
-    3.651243181021106
subject : structural fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field can the commission confirm that in the last structural fund programming period , 1994 - 1999 , no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas ?    3.2971364820732396
can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the member states on the plans and programmes for the new 2000 - 2006 period ?    3.971372533004035
what role will aid from the structural funds play , on the other hand , in the promotion of renewable energy ?    5.046246822776165
can we expect that structural fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional , renewable energy sources ?    3.6235043250548427
will the structural funds also finance the large - scale energy transmission networks ?    3.2406664787142057
on mrs isler béguin ' s first point i must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the community ' s priorities during the previous programming period .    4.012944723305196
the support allocated by the structural funds for technological cohesion , or research and technical developments , within the community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately eur 7 . 5 billion .    3.626801366050371
this is about 6 % of the whole community contribution .    4.38457954573054
with regard to your specific concern , i can say that , as in the previous period , the commission does not intend to directly finance through the structural funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission .    4.423963458600381
however , it is still the responsibility of the member states ' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these csfs .    3.6366072941101426
consequently , even though this is not a community priority , a member state can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area , provided that these projects contribute to regional development . the commission does not have to be systematically informed of these .    4.509018953748278
on your second point of renewable energy which , as you know , is of great interest to me , the commission ' s approach is given in the document on the structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion funds .    4.18346447200658
these funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources , where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level .    3.511998879037961
i was able to verify this , for example , during a visit i made to the azores in portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy .    3.7147201485198518
the structural funds contribution which has enabled greater UNK of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the transport and energy department .    3.753122384073772
finally , on large - scale energy transmission networks , the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation .    3.1120140266481027
this is particularly valid for the region of the azores which i have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions . it is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains , for example .    3.831533420894352
commissioner , thank you for your answer . however , i asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled ' international UNK experimental UNK ' .    3.5583684691356967
this project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for structural funds , such as those listed in objective 1 , might welcome this type of installation .    3.643852681607316
we would like to know whether the commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific ' nuclear research ' context .    3.4111955250559687
you did not fully answer the last part of my question on large - scale energy transmission networks .    2.7629080099141157
could you please give an answer on this issue ?    3.3947528161376255
you are concerned about whether the structural funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere .    4.513486767682146
quite simply there is no question of this .    3.6419369057426954
i said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the member states pursuant to the structural funds regulation .    3.7702487387270582
as a result , the commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected .    3.4821493426334333
however , you are right to question me as this is your task , as mine is to answer you .    3.6928170370642497
as has happened in the past , the member states are required to provide answers when the commission questions them or asks for clarification .    4.109315369662006
i will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between member states and the commission and i will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point .    3.686188459361052
the member state or states concerned will then be required to answer me and i will send you this answer as soon as possible .    3.496367904165695
i thought i had answered your question on large - scale energy transmission networks .    2.419221446599152
the energy situation varies widely from region to region in the european union . assistance from the structural funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions , particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped .    3.9100658177875607
this is the only answer i can give you on the link between large - scale energy transmission networks and the structural funds .    2.7107613995050652

question no 46 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.263320448211546
subject : structural funds and additionality in the light of the commission ' s recent helpful response to my priority written question about structural funds and additionality , i wish to ask whether the commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality .    4.03249590592902
in particular , would the commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of member states but also within member states , with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries ?    4.030180968425295
mr maccormick , the commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated , for the 2000 - 2006 period , in article 11 of the general regulation on the funds .    4.150517028504189
as in the past , these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the structural funds and all development expenditure of the member state .    4.143610272550115
in this respect , it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the structural funds which must be additional .    4.080266053742759
the cofinancing provided by the member state does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure .    4.289031489510672
provided that the member state does not reduce all its own expenditure , the structural funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected .    3.243024640585265
as for the budgetary provisions within the member states , between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries , these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules .    3.3271998664813207
however , after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post - berlin structural funds regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle .    3.7285778488298416
- i am grateful for a clear answer though naturally a little disappointed by its content .    3.6956804715377407
we are left with article 11 ( 1 ) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the member states .    3.1193546806321875
very well : that is to be the UNK rule .    5.364313339673332
does section 11 ( 1 ) conceivably authorise the following practice .    3.1918472233778163
when an autonomous region ' s or country ' s funding from european structural funds increases , the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region , so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the union .    3.641600468440718
is that really authorised ?    3.4057472313230313
unfortunately i do not have time to go into depth on this issue . if mr maccormick would be satisfied with my partial agreement with his reasoning , i will give him a full answer in writing by restating the legal bases of both article 11 in general and article 11 ( 1 ) in particular .    3.842065786603346
i am aware of the member ' s competence on these matters .    3.939337260938199
i also know the particular problems in your constituency in scotland where disputes and discussions are occurring on these subjects .    3.144232758488458
however , on a general level , i would say that in all cases it is the structural funds expenditure which must be additional . this is how , provided that the member state does not reduce all its own expenditure , the structural funds can be added to the national expenditure and we can consider that the additionality principle is respected .    4.171409431704835
i will go further in the written answer which i have promised in order to set things out more objectively and precisely .    3.8902578191348822
- additionality is a major issue too in wales , which i represent .    3.7390785589011823
as recently as 1991 and 1992 the commission won a battle with the uk over additionality , at that time linked to the UNK funding .    3.612510251498727
this led to an agreement being signed whereby the uk government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that eu spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional .    3.537205982252119
and yet we still have these problems in wales and in scotland .    3.4190204041641903
could the commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the uk government ?    3.825394821581294
i take this to mean that the debate of which i was aware in scotland is also occurring in wales .    4.242714450827496
i will verify this point and , if you wish , i will give you a written answer at the same time as the one i have promised to mr maccormick .    4.041176525878686
question no 47 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.305039525618376
subject : amount which andalusia will receive from the structural funds for the 2000 - 2006 period according to the commission ' s estimates and on the basis of the criteria established at the berlin summit ( which include per capita gdp , the unemployment rate and the population census updated in accordance with the 1996 register of inhabitants ) , what amount is to be allocated to andalusia from the structural funds for the 2000 - 2006 period ?    3.422008124666381
questions to mr bolkestein    3.8688543139692495
mr president , i will try to be brief in UNK the member ' s question . the regional development plan submitted by the spanish authorities on 29 october does not indicate how the community funds will be allocated among the spanish objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of andalusia will receive .    3.372816066459503
as i did not fully understand the plan , i contacted the minister for economic and financial affairs , mr UNK , in a letter of 14 december which i have here , to ask him for more information on the document submitted .    4.167171412668659
in the coming weeks , the commission will start negotiations with the spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the community support framework for the new period of 2000 - 2006 . during these meetings i can assure you that the commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation .    4.197149603878781
therefore , if you wish , as soon as i have this information by sector and region , i will personally send you the information on andalusia .    4.26498301298317
mr commissioner , the problem is that when mr aznar comes to the european union to receive money for all the people of andalusia , he counts all of them , but when he goes to the andalusia council to pay for services , he fails to notice 400 000 andalusians , and this is very serious , because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of strasbourg or a city larger than UNK , full of children .    4.117579894658216
this question is very important and i would like to know - since this is a kind of ' baby fraud ' - whether the commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the andalusians , so that the funds which the european union are going to pay to andalusia , based on the census , will take into account these 400 000 children which aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services .    4.456931986505436
mrs izquierdo rojo , i would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly community matters .    4.570717048268912
i know that these are very important issues in spain and there are differing viewpoints .    4.240450050141022
i would point out to the commissioner that mr aznar is the president of the spanish government .    3.467287500770168
mrs izquierdo rojo , i hear that you have a strong voice . i hope it is loud enough to be heard in madrid for i realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me .    3.7887058149182
i have given you my answer .    2.877291642380291
i am keen that the structural funds , particularly those in objective 1 , are allocated where needed .    3.4365851987460774
we have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of europe should or could receive .    3.7907518043603377
i can only say that i must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country . i am not avoiding the issue but i must abide by the general regulation .    4.222558379074081
it is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible .    2.927917522837117
i need to know about this allocation , however , and this is why i said that i could not answer today .    5.052850104030726
as i did not have an answer , i wrote to the minister for economic and financial affairs on 14 december .    3.458691457604771
i am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but i will send you this when i get it .    3.0507161191006458
i regret that the commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and , in this case , passionate intervention .    3.582508354273212
i would like to remind all of you that spain is about to hold elections , and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections .    3.502210280986196
it should be of comfort to the commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time , since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again .    4.218627676257517
i do believe it is important to say that andalusia is going to receive 50 % more within the community support framework and that spain also holds the record for the use of the structural funds , which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different community support frameworks .    3.887652113908997
lastly i would like to ask the commissioner a specific question : do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the structural funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable ?    4.198225337959046
this is a UNK debate which i realise is not totally community - related .    3.287377565680898
having said this , we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the european union .    3.5548382236401967
i am pleased that the structural funds are the subject of discussions in greece and spain .    3.5136774733239053
we were talking a short while ago in this house about debates involving our citizens , about public debates .    3.6631716258012896
the more we talk about europe and what europe is doing for daily life , even when we disagree , the better this will be , provided that we talk about this objectively .    4.262185276692891
i am not going to give an opinion on any amendment to the structural funds regulation .    3.2576300773620726
this regulation was adopted just last year in berlin and i will be applying it for the next seven years .    3.9784229092329304
we will talk about this issue during the cohesion report which i regard as an important time for making an assessment with and before this house and for outlining future prospects . the time will come at the beginning of next year for any amendments to be highlighted .    3.487227479739154
for the time being , please let me apply the regulation which has not yet been applied as it was only approved in berlin .    3.4974966745133
this is all i can say today .    2.8852006312513945
thank you very much for your replies , mr barnier .    2.8035842189442777
questions nos 48 to 50 will be replied to in writing .    2.5789454077759415
question no 51 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.261605290650222
subject : new premises for the ohim at present the office for harmonisation in the internal market ( ohim ) is still operating from the same temporary premises , even though its new building was opened in june 1999 .    3.142677502599718
in view of this unusual situation , will the commission say why the ohim has not yet moved to its new premises ?    3.5328464794770986
the honourable member asked a question on this topic in november 1999 and i would like to refer him to the answer given at the time .    4.025610567127496
furthermore , i have asked the president of the office for harmonisation in the internal market , that is to say the office in alicante , to comment further on this new question and i can , as a result , inform the honourable member as follows , on behalf of the office :    4.257695243330631
the office is not yet ready to move into the new building .    3.839931011150915
unfortunately , a number of deadlines have been exceeded .    3.9401030112670106
a number of technical provisions need to be made , such as the installation of a computer network , UNK , a UNK and furniture .    4.777402369553439
the ohim is now in the process of UNK this and is expecting to move into the new premises by june .    3.7802825712648187
during the previous question , we were discussing electoral issues .    3.707622357816936
i believe that this issue is relevant to my question . commissioner , you were not present at the extraordinarily named ' official opening ' of the headquarters of the ohim on 9 june , in the middle of an election campaign in spain leading up to both the european elections and the local and regional elections .    3.714955503949054
if you had been there , i am sure you would have been ashamed .    4.344838974605297
the president of the commission and some UNK were present .    3.7630202747198176
it was bizarre to see the president of the region of UNK UNK the work of the spanish government , as well as his own work , although it was irrelevant to that event .    5.030898562651043
i am not worried that the spanish government should look foolish , because at the end of the day it was their responsibility , but it does worry me that the commission should look foolish by endorsing , through its presence , this absurd event .    3.7323747029389738
i would therefore like to ask you , mr commissioner : does it seem normal to you that an UNK building should be opened during an election campaign ?    3.0005360592799204
does it seem normal to you that the commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the spanish government ?    3.366189195808056
it does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one member state or another .    3.0697827083344364
as such , i would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which mr berenguer has just described .    3.6280246050121083
i have to UNK that i fail to comprehend why a certain opening UNK was held in spain .    3.4270345210942574
what i can say is that i hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible .    3.4069266652622088
may i also add that i hope to be in alicante myself at the end of may to speak at a conference .    4.262975523457705
i hope that this building will then be occupied .    2.9031400414822106
i would like to point out to the commissioner that it is not an electoral question .    3.1400129201627553
as members of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons .    3.9329476509089414
a year later , it is still not functioning , which means that the commission spent money on a false opening .    4.150757536269973
we should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified .    3.3608319950994328
i would like to reiterate that the commission is UNK with the underlying motivation of member state actions .    3.9163653852480125
it is , however , interested in official statements and actions .    3.139543698426208
we do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in french un UNK d ' intention .    3.417427339605501
we are concerned with public official actions and events , rather than any possible underlying motivation .    3.2037792910157328
this is why i find it also difficult to meet mr medina halfway and respond to his question .    2.9973868864063853
once again , the commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned . it only appreciates that a building for this office is opened and occupied as soon as possible .    2.8403281812195176
also , the commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or UNK .    3.3978279312613844
as far as i am concerned , all expenditure is real .    2.508215636312648
and any remaining UNK , i intend to leave them in the UNK .    4.325933249842042
question no 54 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.263212095922257
subject : alcohol monopoly and the internal market what action does the commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the state alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by sweden , and the associated import restrictions , and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied ?    4.356861151308102
i would like to answer these two questions as follows .    2.911121070310535
when sweden joined the european union , it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic UNK which travellers can bring into the country from other member states .    3.677079971003883
this derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 june of this year .    3.11816314933825
sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years , as this would be necessary to protect public health .    3.980449035862745
my position on this is clear .    3.997355003510824
sweden has now had sufficient time - since its accession to the union - to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist .    3.6624374112497518
i cannot see a reason , therefore , why a further extension for this measure should be proposed .    3.5099905911533726
european citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use , including taxes , in any member sate and to take them to another member sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them .    3.7687517594876674
that is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time .    3.457246449970548
we want to guarantee that swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market , just like other citizens of the european union .    3.380863261019782
a recent study , carried out by professor lindgren of the university of lund , however , has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in sweden .    3.677419792250025
i have already had a chance to discuss my position with mr ringholm , the swedish finance minister on two occasions .    3.188026129241564
i also discussed this matter with the swedish parliamentary finance committee last week .    3.212921780703971
it is now up to the swedish government to take the necessary measures .    3.8447316187046994
thank you for your reply .    2.2516137870648967
i should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the commission . instead of 2004 , it should , of course , be 1 july 2000 .    3.748317137718768
i have some sympathy with the commission ' s standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally .    3.808263065308415
such a rule is only normal .    3.004138135553091
nevertheless , i should like to ask two questions : are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the swedish government about extending the derogations , for example for as long as denmark and finland have derogations ?    3.472023977918933
my second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol .    2.800027103228155
this may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole eu .    4.323631748103871
what are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the commission ' s work ?    3.2745373964468483
a europe - wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market . it also has important implications for public health .    3.764965058224019
if we had considered these aspects in their overall context , then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with sweden .    3.380105129013431
may i thank mr andersson for the supplement to his first question and may i answer that question as follows ?    3.5347623663176044
firstly , finland and denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003 .    3.124722837401809
these countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003 .    3.62425419587779
however , in the case of sweden , the situation is different .    3.4376595385949975
in 1995 , a five - year derogation period was decided upon , which is now lapsing .    4.220245157341256
i have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the commission would need to extend this period .    4.405142192000932
secondly , the swedish government is being consulted all the way .    3.3950054688612146
i can inform mr andersson that i will leave for stockholm on monday , 6 march , in order to talk to minister ringholm , to members of the swedish parliament , and , if necessary , also to the prime minister or other ministers , in order to continue discussions on this matter . i am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in sweden regarding this issue .    4.342313654012091
thirdly , i understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important .    4.098225064896044
i would repeat at this juncture what professor lindgren of lund university has stated , namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions , the consumption of alcohol will remain the same .    3.3358129652812045
the question is then , of course , where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers ?    3.811873604714863
the answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the swedes themselves , and as mr andersson knows , this is an extremely dangerous and UNK activity .    4.433174849115784
well now , mr andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol .    3.8719247596100037
but in that case , not only sweden , but all eu countries , should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol .    4.2031168425171845
we can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the united states .    3.4892833099310367
mr andersson will be familiar with what was termed then ' prohibition ' .    3.215486483122612
all this means that we need to protect health , of course , but not by banning alcohol , because that does not work .    4.531920680012534
mr president , the question at issue is the income from the swedish alcohol monopoly and when the swedish government says that it must cover health costs , then this is proof of a distortion of competition because other countries must cover their health costs themselves , with no alcohol monopoly at their disposal .    3.281099707877035
my question refers to whether you too know of studies which state that a moderate UNK of good quality alcohol such as UNK wine or bavarian beer is good for you and would therefore also be good for the swedish budget .    3.321414927327996
i gather that mr posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter .    3.1990044162478095
i also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in sweden goes back to the year UNK and that since then , the sale of alcohol products has UNK for a significant portion of the state ' s tax revenue .    3.9739062862371592
as is known , this has led to a state monopoly in sweden which , in itself , is at odds with union legislation .    4.030212496425554
as to the UNK effect of alcohol - to which , i believe , mr posselt also made reference - i could not agree more with him : i think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant , and perhaps mr posselt , mr andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this parliament one of these days to share an aquavit .    3.8915950448884735
mr president , i listened with interest to the commissioner ' s reply about the need to apply the laws of the single market .    3.850313932546086
i wonder whether he can say whether he considers his reply to be compatible with the failure by the commission to take the french government to the european court of justice on the application of france ' s UNK et UNK , which effectively prevents single market rules applying to the sale of alcohol products in france ?    4.029196444975977
can we now expect the european commission to take action against the french republic before the european court of justice ?    4.142347001582246
i should like to reply very briefly to the question raised by the honourable member , since this matter is now under active consideration by the commission .    3.5056261468388064
the commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the european court of justice .    3.8765170298999587
my reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now , but i would like to assure the honourable member that the commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks .    4.323260750066446
i ask for the member ' s understanding for this small delay in the commission ' s decision .    3.811132546294715
commissioner , do you have any reason , on public health grounds , for a difference in the taxation rates on , for example , scotch whisky or french bordeaux wine or even my colleague ' s bavarian beer ?    3.477448747965521
can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in europe ?    2.9084101038104313
the matter of excise taxes , to which the honourable member is referring , is the prerogative of the member state concerned .    4.596377208387065
the commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products .    2.8890920746102813
towards the end of this year the commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between member states .    4.269104652050084
it will no doubt engage in a discussion both with parliament and the council on this state of affairs , which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between member states .    3.8818870348612755
for example - i believe the honourable member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in france , whereas they are applied in the united kingdom .    3.925802938319874
that leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from france to the united kingdom .    3.3675429930943666
the question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax .    3.1639225626365226
the commission has no means of influence here .    2.840098870141607
in the case of sweden , the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol .    2.99446093978476
although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between sweden and other member states of the union - and that by itself increases cross - border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol .    3.4565557589517475
there is , of course , elasticity of demand , in this case a price elasticity of demand .    3.167088676454486
i am not sure exactly what it is , but it is not zero , therefore it must have some effect .    3.979667631791673
my question would have been almost exactly the one raised by mr purvis , but i would like to press the point further .    4.061712499117696
granted , as you say , that excise duties lie within the prerogative of member states , nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the community UNK others might still conflict with the single market principle .    4.554339417908104
for example , if we take what mr purvis and i would be thinking of , the malt whisky producing parts of the highlands - a very peripheral part of europe , very hard - pressed , a whole farming community as well as a UNK community dependent upon it - a general practice of UNK the alcohol in scotch whisky , dutch UNK or danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine , seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the member states .    3.493581408574603
may i assure mr maccormick and other members of this parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between member states is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market .    3.999278939980407
we need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products .    3.001333165430016
if one looks at petrol , for example , one sees that excise taxes in germany are different from those of holland , and consequently dutch UNK cross the border and fill up their tanks in germany .    3.0622408911794183
that is indeed distortion of the internal market .    2.8287773005578756
if i had my way , i would wave a magic wand and UNK excise taxes across europe .    3.527386272701699
as a result , smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one member state than another .    2.8428159751341666
but i do not have a magic wand and i do not have my way .    3.4832904203589123
this is an area of unanimity , as mr maccormick knows , and unless all member states agree on the equalisation of excise taxes , it will not happen .    3.9579212712476997
once again , towards the end of this year , the commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes , and i am obviously available for any discussion with parliament on that report .    4.241614644610775
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.894443415166077
today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of alsace wine , although we do not know how much tax is put on it , but i suppose it is a lot .    4.755829740441489
since the time allotted to questions to the commission has elapsed , questions 55 to UNK will be replied to in writing .    2.638277696258343
that concludes questions to the commission .    2.4394118234569566
( the sitting was suspended at 7 . 30 p . m . and resumed at 9 . 00 p . m . )    1.7640728665140835
community policy in the field of water ( continuation )    3.046870726468354
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the community action in the field of water policy .    2.881753579209831
mr president , the situation regarding fresh water in europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but , in general terms , it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease .    4.126343468515737
to this we must add the water pollution problems which UNK the potential new member states in the east .    4.176905489411378
in fact , a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in romania , threatening UNK which supply the population of yugoslavia .    2.8101493019619417
i understand that mrs wallström , whose presence here tonight i appreciate , is going to visit the area .    3.557122022847382
i believe that no country , no government and , of course , no member of this parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin .    4.479839030937148
the development of this directive has been difficult and complex , involving diverse interests and divided opinions .    3.554067767607598
i have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature , mrs lienemann , has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions , and has succeeded to a large extent .    3.4288388124000817
however , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .    3.1581662806048736
i come from a country whose southern half is on the mediterranean and the availability of water UNK depends on the UNK of an UNK climate and a difficult UNK .    3.79017603036721
the mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this UNK , century after century , year after year , day after day , and is still doing so today .    3.4418009430479
in accordance with this principle , the spanish delegation of the european people ' s party will oppose amendments nos 4 ( recital 21 ) , 13 and 49 ( article 11 ( d ) , since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the member states , that is , the regulation of water resources .    3.7413614084476805
it would be very difficult for the community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions , given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests .    4.075764363054224
we also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010 .    3.6381032238193947
we must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which , at the same time , safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less - favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development .    3.002979955153531
i would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero , or close to zero , degree of pollution .    3.456145156653774
in no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution .    2.924929852481587
we will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions .    3.4060387232483
i hope that , once again , this house will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity , seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations , the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much .    3.960128783385248
mr president , commissioner , this is a very important directive .    2.8174476130629054
its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems .    3.4004885741498927
the public must have a right to clean water .    3.915415183892184
it is important not only for the environment but also for public health .    4.052732009519073
i am not speaking so much for myself , as i happen to be one of those few lucky people in europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home .    4.040149493817316
we must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality .    3.2669253842358708
action must get under way immediately .    3.563504551749684
we cannot afford to waste time .    2.83555312884507
it is important that the timetable is an ambitious one .    3.211745919016737
in my opinion , the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then .    3.1347797191977276
it is a question of doing what is technically possible ; obviously it is not possible to do anymore , but we must be sufficiently ambitious .    3.932582123678308
i would like to comment on one issue , which was spoken about earlier .    3.292605378660147
i believe the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water .    2.813822927653407
this is not merely a problem for spain ; it is one for the nordic countries , and i sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters , when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive .    4.0913686403994625
mr president , madam commissioner , congratulations , mrs lienemann on an excellent piece of work .    3.092709745606977
water and air surround us everywhere .    3.426055462128752
we share them with everyone on this earth .    2.822804006295577
water is a prerequisite for human life .    3.391809189889108
and there are more and more of us in the world .    4.25996794168343
mrs schleicher UNK earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal .    2.926652661806103
nothing could be further from the truth !    3.6523005662596675
it is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so , too , the conditions for life .    4.226689951647718
it is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources .    3.1571531505623835
i would therefore appeal to members of parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long - term realism of the highest order .    3.5333833153605805
mr president , we - myself included - support the report by mrs lienemann , the targets it sets and the directive under discussion .    3.202444885994009
however , we should look a little more closely at some points .    3.378642204633612
for example , a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes , which people try to justify by pseudo - developmental arguments , and which , of course , are a great risk to ground waters , water tables and surface waters .    3.5309684068703877
i therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such UNK take place , the specifications common to us all must be very stringent .    3.2099920596197755
but the key issue is , in my opinion , planning how to restore water tables , the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes , which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind .    3.547583859563521
i think such projects ought to be eligible for funding , because , at the end of the day , that restoration may well prove to be a first - rate development policy .    3.5132635770618466
mr president , here we have what is basically a good measure .    3.1269881104001236
it sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management .    3.0251956283448656
its aim of good - quality water for drinking , for wildlife , the environment and economic purposes is right .    3.2369979431541966
the prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood .    3.8465342655822683
we have three outstanding problems .    3.260832276799794
the first is the transfer of water between basin areas .    2.7587574752351034
that is a matter which affects my colleagues from spain , ireland and the united kingdom .    3.2971076932606223
amendments nos 4 . 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed , be that arid areas or urban areas .    3.7520282310255335
secondly , we have to have realistic targets , but targets nevertheless .    3.1778550540167165
looking at amendment no 7 , for example , which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances , you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic .    3.722187254187099
also , some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in english , that is quite a meaningless term .    4.33076574147223
we need to look very carefully at those .    2.9515530512961146
the concept of continuing reduction as in amendment no 58 is much better .    3.3588358731093524
thirdly , i raise the problem faced by scotch whisky .    2.804366601875576
scotch whisky - especially malt whisky , which is the best - requires water UNK which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream .    3.8476566897521844
some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk .    3.3453183821310946
we must make sure that amendments nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in " high quality " , which means it must use good , scottish peat water .    2.978519889104997
that is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole .    3.156331391044122
mr president , first of all , we want to denounce the UNK hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water , but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against yugoslavia , aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded , have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too , making them not only UNK but even extremely hazardous .    3.3102470084315305
turning to the report , we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata , or even in the annihilation of small and medium - scale farmers because of the UNK cost of water for irrigation .    3.9398490792903718
we also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country , and especially on the islands , funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water , by increasing not its cost but its quantity . this should mainly be carried out by collecting the UNK that now goes to waste , running off into the sea and eroding the soil , with all the problems that creates .    3.693367914693628
in that spirit , we support amendment no 107 by mr marset campos .    3.7661248031958134
river waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought .    4.189947894618333
finally , as regards the council ' s allegation , which the commission echoes , that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein , this is UNK .    4.28282739945344
its purpose is to preserve a semi - transparent field of action , which during the directive ' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business .    3.118421107114114
mr president , first and foremost , i want to say that protection of the aquatic environment , both surface water and groundwater , is probably one of our most important duties of all .    3.197969932639764
that is not only because it is about guaranteeing sufficient water resources but also because it is , to a large degree , about safeguarding water resources against pollution so that we can also have clean drinking water in the future .    4.222984707354061
we are all entitled to clean drinking water .    2.7105609140551334
i should like to express my great appreciation of mrs lienemann ' s work on this matter .    2.9400823154766664
it has been a huge task , and i should like to express my support for all of mrs lienemann ' s amendments . these are all improvements to the common position .    4.009830578947787
moreover , i shall only highlight the most important ones .    4.248501029636636
first and foremost , i think it is important that we should establish some clear objectives concerning the condition we should have achieved for our water within a period of no more than 10 years .    3.7865693969879617
i also think it is important that we should put pressure on the member states to devise the necessary action programmes more quickly than is proposed in the common position .    3.53650833216943
and , finally , i want to say that i think that the tighter arrangements which are being introduced in regard to payment schemes and pricing are quite proper if we , as consumers , are to be given an incentive to use water resources efficiently and , at the same time , obtain arrangements which can promote the achievement of those environmental goals about which , i believe , there is broad agreement .    4.118006138094244
in this regard , too , i think that the 2010 deadline is appropriate .    3.333319396186224
finally , i want to say that i attach great importance to making a start on phasing out discharges , emissions and leaks of hazardous materials and to the fact that we can do this gradually but , at the same time , be set a target , namely the year 2020 by which time we should hopefully have reduced such emissions to zero .    3.417942695876663
if this cannot be adopted as the objective , then i am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020 .    3.8069112623552672
mr president , i would like to thank the rapporteur for some excellent work in drafting this important directive .    2.5751956637305207
the second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely ; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in romania must feature in today ' s discussions and also more generally when we UNK the environmental dimension of union enlargement .    3.9741193185380137
first of all we have to find and call to account those who are guilty of the act .    3.6143938556886694
the cyanide and heavy metals in the rivers are gruesome examples of how environmental negligence may ruin the waterways for decades to come .    2.8414139553781848
the event proves that in some countries applying for eu membership the environmental norms and environmental thinking are still light years behind the eu .    3.300934719607716
the union ought to UNK how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water .    3.6153992198546994
with regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean , natural groundwater .    3.3287791788528285
in finland surface waters are very clean .    3.213842923441075
the production of so - called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of UNK a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves .    3.6390833411059305
the process does not require a chemical sewage plant .    3.0324814472106976
the directive must not be allowed to UNK this work .    3.7912080280846396
UNK from the council ' s common position , the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water .    2.9852852277393462
this would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed .    3.310502551487728
the ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by union acts .    3.8639904111775603
mr president , commissioner , water is a precious natural asset , a vital necessity , and it is our duty to protect it .    3.0919505130308456
i think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the european union , which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources , and i congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view .    4.0090509141241
i must say , however , that , there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water , and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way .    4.262008385331919
there are parts of europe with an inherent shortage of water , and that should be taken into account by this directive .    4.337335065195085
in recent years , climate change has compelled mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain .    3.0263362858115617
we agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled , whose aim is to improve it .    4.071914404264863
however , we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water , granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers .    3.697755711628972
in addition , amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage .    3.2469050643015995
the issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought , i think , to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it .    4.680076065994493
as for the time scale demanded for the directive ' s implementation , it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive ' s implementation will take time and considerable resources .    3.8314429165461377
in spite of these remarks however , i believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained .    3.8997151480020738
mr president , commissioner , the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans , comprehensive information and hearing rights , and close cooperation between the member states , to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants .    3.066517679551654
and considering how long this chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind , i am pleased to be present here today , and i would like to congratulate mrs lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us .    3.670186678760348
however , it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted .    3.75549674052562
i would still like to highlight this point though : this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for UNK water from a member state ' s territory against its will .    3.706958175647533
and by way of reaffirming this once again , i have introduced an amendment - UNK with the support of a large number of members - and i would be very pleased if parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow .    4.641337993490865
it is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual eu member states and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it .    3.695826101509088
i am aware , and the previous speaker highlighted this , that there are states in the european union that have problems with water .    5.076087803125401
this applies to every country .    2.7355279410116107
but only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources , when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries , only then , in my view , should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage .    3.9557776671159046
mr president , commissioner , we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading .    3.4236856265350912
however , i must say that i am not over - pleased because i believe that this directive is not of great quality , it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings .    4.168731117427284
firstly , i believe that this directive is excessively tough , simplistic and reductionist .    3.1147777770228564
in many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done , although i know that this is not pleasant .    4.491814327442426
it is not a question of having much tougher regulations , because in many cases the problems concern management . it is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative , the UNK of which we are all well aware of .    4.11151019272201
this is a reductionist directive . we cannot lump countries with UNK rivers together with countries which lack water , where great UNK open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of UNK or UNK in the sun .    3.6875964363970986
i say this because the ball does not need to be in our court . this issue is in the hands of the governments and the commission .    3.9479899728855075
in the same way , this damage and these tragedies which are happening , as in romania , are not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the governments .    4.437458850577196
furthermore , it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large UNK areas , climatic diversity , desert areas and arid areas .    3.0746615444798318
that is how the common position has been worded .    3.411578419246457
the same can be said with regard to transfers .    3.857846119511959
transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth , of solidarity between peoples and territories , because unfortunately the earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less .    3.482976012147624
lastly , i am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact .    4.067613325269714
it is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but , on environmental questions , we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people , how many farmers , could be ruined by having to pay the costs .    3.920776527452917
some kind of study has been done which has not even been read , and i believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice , rather than just laying down doctrine .    4.1468795753149275
mr president , through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the european union .    3.6191027393546453
it is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface , ground , transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and , in our case in ireland , cross - border level .    4.407055310994673
ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the european parliament amendments .    5.382920701132954
a 25 - year roll - out for legislation , for example , is hardly acceptable .    3.620636176926184
we have no difficulty with the " polluter pays " principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial , commercial and agricultural level .    3.0670510541130493
however , i feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right , this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge , a quota per household for drinking , UNK and sanitation .    3.4314199140697967
we must of course pay for wastage and luxury use at domestic level and the recovery of costs can be balanced accordingly .    2.8184776001431446
the introduction of water meters is viewed with great suspicion in ireland where we have had no domestic water charges and hence no meters since 1977 .    3.357567532792679
meters could be viewed as a very important tool in water management by the new river basin districts , to help the elimination of water wastage and for the proper planning of future requirements .    4.383836842799904
the whole purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable use of water in the eu .    3.8594393616774405
water is a scarce and precious natural resource .    2.9141115860043825
ideally , i would like amendment no 45 to fall tomorrow so that the common position on article 9 would hold on water charges .    4.647337736082465
that would allow for subsidiarity on a cost policy for water charges , with each member states drawing up its own scheme , so long as the principles of this directive on incentives for sustainable and efficient use of water are fully protected .    3.7007395987409706
if amendment no 45 does not fall , i will have to move an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that member states may grant exemptions to the provisions of this article in order to allow a basic level of water use for domestic purposes before contributions to the recovery of cost of water services .    3.971717105623394
all legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance .    3.8587693352504817
i believe that access to clean drinking water without charge is a basic human right in the developed as well as the developing world .    3.348953358132504
mr president , commissioner , at this point in the debate i am going to insist on certain aspects which , from an UNK point of view , and since i come from a southern country , i consider to be absolutely essential to this directive .    3.887796491462147
these include , for example , costs and transfers .    3.4316222369158518
with regard to costs , i would like clarification of what costs we are talking about .    3.7709005991797935
are we talking about the distribution and UNK of water ?    3.9064375295033593
are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks ?    3.511239663384039
are we talking about the nature of the works required to provide water services ?    3.361079329074763
or are we talking about large - scale UNK works and reservoirs ?    3.463609795270659
all these costs added together would be horrendous and would have repercussions for the agricultural sector .    2.892142930912176
transfers are defined as the transfer of surface water between different territorial areas .    3.3852969839611355
is the commissioner aware that our country has one of the UNK systems of transfers in europe ?    3.6577175685756655
they already existed in ancient times : they had them in roman times , although on a smaller scale .    3.1158830621970965
the largest volume transferred in one year has been UNK and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200 .    3.6370374546744917
we cannot be accused of bad management .    2.901684271868607
is the commissioner aware that , of this UNK hm3 , we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the UNK , 30 for water supplies in the area of the júcar , 7 for supplies in the southern area of the júcar and the rest in the segura , equally divided between supplies and irrigation ?    3.360246665967403
we are not doing a bad job of management .    3.1666509568443404
we cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it .    3.4418127139687242
i will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies , because i believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive .    4.342795610139572
take good note : in this diverse europe , which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation , we have to find diverse solutions , not single solutions .    4.51354334797205
i therefore appeal to the common sense of the commission , the council and this house so that , when voting , they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of europe in areas where subsidiarity is required .    4.509445597431151
commissioner , andalusia is not lapland .    3.073115520627499
. ( sv ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i want , of course , to begin by thanking the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and , above all , the rapporteur , mrs lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive .    3.0060279632444313
water is one of our most important natural resources , as many speakers have already said .    3.732503585252685
an ambitious and well - balanced european policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for europe .    3.999438330241032
water is also one of the issues to which i shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office .    3.968975760900095
i am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to parliament .    3.2138061501585846
many of them are based upon the very constructive , informal discussions which have taken place between parliament and the council in connection with the first reading .    4.086257095201559
most of parliament ' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious .    3.441910091806066
the commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments , either in their entirety , partially or in principle .    2.999269778729392
many of the amendments which parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary .    3.4620947917187697
with a view to these forthcoming negotiations , i would therefore urge parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position .    4.301976067354479
firstly , i should like to mention some of my most important arguments .    3.404895337983986
we now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the ospar convention .    3.6357425259900324
rather than make these objectives legally binding , we must consider their political nature .    3.5954542275938826
this is also reflected in many of parliament ' s amendments .    3.730231408591549
where water charges are concerned , the present directive will constitute europe ' s water policy for the next three decades .    4.108135438901561
it is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost - effective way .    3.3413002288572025
it sounds good , saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge .    3.822039183162327
but water is not free of charge , any more than houses or food are free of charge .    3.205035441096737
it is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully UNK as a resource .    3.9864330709394236
i also want to add that , when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities , i support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules . i also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances .    3.554114361312039
in the course of the debate , many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed .    3.8156934978706682
i just want to emphasise this further .    3.1446889690158204
it is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them .    2.7976095756355486
allow me also to say to mr bowe that , in common with my scottish colleague , he need have no UNK of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of scotch whisky now and again .    3.321113937114832
we have not considered it necessary for the commission to regulate the very limited UNK of water for whisky production .    4.274917339519439
allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail .    4.291488443940291
limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives .    3.5577256946103004
i am glad to see that parliament ' s amendments have focused upon this .    3.0443771300196185
the commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the ospar convention into the text .    3.7717621281343767
we must , however , keep to their precise scope and content .    3.500852231580298
as i said , their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character .    2.832097879195993
it would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable .    3.691498405164604
it must nonetheless be guaranteed that the member states and the community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables .    3.734459635002692
i therefore welcome amendments nos 6 , 10 , 14 , 24 , 58 , 60 and 88 .    2.958126677986349
the commission cannot , on the other hand , approve amendment no 19 , in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in ospar .    3.591199305140566
the commission ' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances , and so no definition is needed .    3.142557003569413
even if i too agree with the contents of amendments nos 79 and 106 , these go beyond the commitments under ospar , and i cannot therefore approve these amendments .    4.2096493866902325
the commission can also , in principle , approve amendment no 60 , according to which a timetable is required for implementing the commission ' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances .    3.522288465269032
amendment no 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed .    2.9904341882791385
the desire expressed in amendments nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved .    3.462363492525311
lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances .    4.074130512164391
i would point out in this regard that the ospar convention does not in any way alter existing community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector .    3.208698677169819
the nitrates directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive .    3.6020173528151975
i appreciate the fact that parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services .    3.57324912937151
i can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way .    3.658311642614185
i also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs .    3.155628163092032
i believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector .    3.688483569057773
this would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured .    3.0563512999495344
i therefore support the overall thrust of amendment no 105 , which is in line with the commission ' s original proposal .    3.6864200936113565
i also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources .    3.2092268531653296
we are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals .    4.255203466719045
this must not , however , be an excuse for UNK inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution .    3.784990492440778
we intend shortly to issue a communication from the commission on precisely this question .    3.7127367124939843
i agree with parliament that the common position ' s sixteen - year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced .    3.472097101709251
the same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years .    3.2910794515852473
amendment no 28 , cancelling the third extension period , is an important step in the right direction .    2.921858417154723
this proposal can therefore be approved .    2.9591074843385594
a period of ten years , as proposed in amendments nos 24 and 26 , among others , is , on the other hand , too short .    4.364359327697539
i believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided .    3.622360461127529
the proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water .    3.1527043111923456
this applies to amendments nos 6 , 24 , 25 , 27 , 30 , 31 , 32 , 33 , 34 , 78 , 80 , 102 and 104 .    2.5949019837762815
these amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found .    3.225656608918843
to comply with the demands in amendments nos 27 and 29 , to the effect that the commission should approve every extension , would be going too far , and these cannot be approved .    4.295968414798435
another important area is protection of the groundwater .    3.5311322971727948
we also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring .    3.2590065403547737
the most important parts of parliament ' s amendments nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle .    3.1293119387423176
the new definition in amendment no 72 is , however , too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose .    3.934750019047933
i would propose that amendment no 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution .    3.1831254471533965
amendment no 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater .    3.530396827383364
the proposal cannot therefore be approved .    2.8543421013354986
the commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality .    3.174360766511561
instead , we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with article 11 to promote activities in this area .    3.459897228235688
the good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled .    3.4340595074250158
the commission appreciates parliament ' s efforts to guarantee that the so - called combined approach is given a central role .    3.9815874345046502
this approach and its scope , which the commission can in principle approve , are defined by amendments nos 22 and 47 .    3.7874849947361366
in order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality , we wish , however , to UNK amendment no 47 and to add a de minimis provision .    4.034021507758006
the transfer of water is already covered by controls , but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer .    3.37216168351355
these parts of amendments nos 49 and 87 can , therefore , be approved .    2.5612394211607024
it is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted .    3.487488909611313
the proposal already specifies that water must be UNK in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned .    3.3141368091887475
these parts of amendments nos 49 and 87 cannot , therefore , be approved .    2.5184992200478034
the commission approves amendment no 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal .    3.187095883715226
the following amendments cannot be approved : 1 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 39 , 40 , 51 , 59 , 61 , 64 , 66 , 70 , 71 , 71 , 72 , 74 , 77 , 79 , 81 , 83 , 87 , 89 , 90 , 91 , 95 , 97 , 98 , 100 , 101 , 103 , 106 and 107 .    1.8937714434296564
finally , i want to say that i welcome the efforts which parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the council takes other views .    4.3638942011283275
important progress has been made , and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions .    4.063819289279358
a number of obstacles remain , but i am convinced that , as the legislative work progresses , we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of .    4.373692700802723
parliament ' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious , european water policy for the next three decades .    3.65291550190188
i would like to hear the commissioner ' s view on amendment no 45 .    3.324535864921056
i may have missed it in the list she gave out .    4.043837852254672
. i accept that .    3.5010761071146748
thank you , mrs wallström .    2.375292509881382
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 p . m .    1.7251901363538669
financial instrument for the environment ( life )    3.4037328691191764
the next item is the recommendation for second reading ( a4 - 0014 / 2000 ) , on behalf of the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy on the common position adopted by the council with a view to adopting a european parliament and council regulation on a financial instrument for the environment ( life ) ( rapporteur : mrs lienemann ) .    2.3470781332519697
rapporteur .    4.4723702221777435
( fr ) mr president , we have already had the opportunity , at the first reading , to examine this report and i was given to believe in committee that there was a broad consensus within this house .    4.3184152296113885
life is the only budget line for direct assistance for the environment in the community budget , and one cannot help but note that it does not live up to our ambitions since the amounts allocated to it have been UNK for years . despite the enlargement which has already taken place , when we renewed the first life programme to move on to the second , despite enlargement , the level of appropriations remained the same .    4.287725954876032
and then we see that , increasingly , the regions , the various operators , businesses , associations , are submitting life projects , both for life - nature and life - environment , projects that are of excellent quality , which following technical assessment by all the competent committees are unanimously found to be worthy of european union support , but we still cannot fund them , for lack of budget appropriations .    3.7012483588086336
it must also be mentioned that this budget experiences a rate of consumption of appropriations which is quite exceptional within the community budget .    3.3000363027986817
patently we have here an instrument that is appropriate for the policies which we wish to implement .    4.170676604210987
i would stress the life - nature strand in particular .    3.141084490093286
we are well aware that , in the european union , a whole raft of directives such as the directive on habitats and the directive on migratory birds encounter problems in implementation . with life - nature we should be able to support policies which demonstrate the feasibility , the validity of the objectives of these directives , and their capacity to be implemented .    4.347397410692149
and , for want of appropriations , we lose this legitimacy and allow the idea that these european directives of ours are not reasonable and are not applicable to develop .    3.394187185682267
and so the debates taking place today focus on two major issues : firstly , comitology , an ongoing debate within this house , but parliament wished to implement policies settled rather by management committees or advisory committees which give the commission some flexibility and which do not give the council too much scope to obstruct and have their intergovernmental philosophy prevail over the community philosophy which we are here to stand up for within the european parliament .    3.6426305917533823
but we have these comitology debates with regard to most of the european union ' s financial programmes and instruments .    4.054577725971511
i would say that in my opinion - and the experiences we have had in the past tend to show this - that reconciling opinions on comitology is rather easier than reconciling opinions on the budget .    3.879426813831397
let me point out that parliament is asking for 850 million ecus in appropriations , not a vast sum in the community budget , and that the current proposals are for 613 million ecus .    3.918796652464322
i feel , at any rate , that for the ultimate application of life , at least , there would be some way for the union to make a significant budgetary gesture in favour of the environment .    4.485353047190269
let me conclude with the matter of our institutions ' way of working .    3.8963123203843564
this is the essence of how i understand the situation : we are being told that it is essential for us to reach a conclusion quickly , that , basically , the members of parliament should drop their claims , particularly claims on the budget , for if we do not soon , in line with the codecision procedure , get around to establishing the framework of the regulations for life , then its implementation for the year 2000 is going to suffer a delay , and in the meantime the ngos and the operators at grass roots level are waiting for our appropriations .    4.251243727120205
i would , however , like to point out that the council has plenty of time to formulate its ideas and that it is submitting its proposals to us only a few months before the fateful date .    3.996195321405125
as for us , we our bound by the terms of the texts : a maximum of four months .    3.6553986256994704
we meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others , because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time .    4.267479820975537
i think parliament often protests about this method , not to point the finger at any specific party within the council , and i certainly would not want the portuguese presidency to feel responsible for this state of affairs , since , the truth is , it is something of a tradition , which the council has kept going for a long time .    4.43505548558999
but i should like to stress the fact that , on this issue of the environment , the budget issue is a central one and parliament cannot yield to the blackmail which requires it to be the only reasonable party in the deal .    4.784522629515872
i therefore hope , firstly , that our fellow members will support us in the conciliation - but votes on this area are always very much in agreement - but also that the council and the commission will manage to listen to us and that we shall each take a step towards the other .    4.484072508004558
mr president , it is true that we are in open disagreement on some of the choices made by the council and the commission , and i will refer to this later on .    4.0226648489794625
it is equally true , however , that we should begin by saying that this regulation is better than those covering life i and life ii .    3.966328045622915
it is better firstly because the framework proposal made life i more rigorous , more transparent and more rational .    3.1189069669061
secondly , it is better because the common position includes some fundamental recommendations , which were advocated by the european parliament at first reading . specifically , these are : to promote employment as a factor to be taken into consideration when selecting candidate projects , and to reduce the environmental impact of products at every stage from production to recycling and elimination .    4.331996720830826
this is one of the aims that life - environment must achieve . thirdly , the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of life - environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step .    4.28687410764989
in spite of all its virtues though , life iii ' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument ' s impact , which is its budget .    3.8937264170283634
by persisting with their proposal of eur 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004 , and by refusing to accept the european parliament ' s proposal of eur 850 million , the commission and the council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of UNK and justice that they introduced , and rightly so , for other measures in life iii .    4.443887836044687
we want the commission and the council to know that we will not give up trying to provide life with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument .    4.388941745352605
we have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice .    3.0023270967609355
firstly , life is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the european union .    3.3020710322683446
there is no other such policy .    3.1660953792213093
secondly , life is an instrument that has already produced good results , and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation .    3.7688126143727914
thirdly , the life budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand .    3.0543142267387657
this means that approving the proposal put forward by the council and by the commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend .    4.034151861685926
our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue , however .    3.0379707232190563
climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the european public and which have deserved considerable attention from this house .    3.8169996805677813
we therefore feel it is crucial that as amendments nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which life - environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water , as well as for reducing greenhouse gases , they should be adopted .    3.3427002280265783
lastly , i would like to congratulate mrs lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though , as was made clear in the committee on the environment , we would prefer life to have been monitored by an advisory committee , we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the council to be accepted as quite frankly , it was worse .    4.438203719412695
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , life is the european union ' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment .    3.109979393397507
that explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions , ambitions for which , of course , there is a price .    3.467223744309487
obviously , the basic item for discussion with the council will be the allocation for life iii .    4.187011571514215
the common position stipulates a total appropriation of eur 613 million for the period 2000 - 2004 . this is not enough .    3.543123120331629
the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party is in favour of increasing this amount to eur 850 million .    2.9250595301394497
we therefore support mrs lienemann ' s amendment which observes that the allocation for life was not increased when the union was last enlarged , without even mentioning the next UNK of new UNK .    2.9249926932023853
the amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure .    3.63487023138577
quite the opposite , it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded .    4.101763780358901
a drop in the ocean , i might say , in comparison with europe ' s structural policies .    3.6295568306752966
the environment is still the poor relation in the european budget , even though it is primarily an investment .    4.478319410149635
an investment in natural resources , of course , but also in employment , since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs , as shown particularly by the great success of life , a success with ngos , businesses , local authorities and third countries .    4.277240080192329
more than one third of the 8 , 500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to UNK approximately 1 , 300 projects between 1992 and 1998 .    3.1913003188250046
a success which parliament wishes and intends to see UNK , and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the life project .    3.7597843332560443
in matters of the environment , investment and ambition come in a variety of forms , and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term .    3.102556189781126
this is the price of the future of generations to come .    3.7669890071788275
mr president , commissioner , i am probably going to repeat things my fellow members have said but i believe that , as far as the council is concerned , the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of life .    3.9328506671564702
i shall therefore reiterate that , as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly , life is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the european union ' s policy on the environment .    3.9052433521994243
this instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in europe , which are adopted and UNK upon by the member states .    4.152960269496644
this financial instrument is , furthermore , deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non - governmental organisations .    3.2500032272874337
that is why , ladies and gentlemen , i would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of life .    3.3823601248969757
through the associations , then , life is a facility that can be used by the european citizen directly , and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community .    5.040373143867874
several million ngo members - millions , i say - recognise in life the union ' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage .    3.985181058991631
life is , moreover , the fundamental instrument of the natura 2000 network in europe into which the member states have put a lot , pursuant to community directives on the habitats of rare and UNK fauna and flora and on migratory birds , and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our states .    3.852606544138509
i should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own states bear the responsibility for obstructing european nature conservation policies .    3.546192055179805
this is a pity because everyone within this chamber knows that life is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by member states , a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds .    3.5851500890931116
let us not forget that , to date , life amounts to only eur 100 million per annum , i . e . scarcely 0 . 1 % of the budget of the european union .    3.0540986507121968
for the record , the budget for agriculture , which has a real impact on the environment , amounts , as we all know , to eur 37 billion .    4.075557589351634
against this background , my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to life and unreservedly supports mrs lienemann ' s proposal to increase the budget to eur 850 million , since we know , and i think it bears saying , how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the council ' s compromise regarding the budget for life is , especially as the life programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice .    3.9784238901045907
the first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those .    3.116385003511551
mr president , the european union environmental programme , to which a considerable amount ( eur 613 million ) has been allocated , gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds .    3.3629516513090763
a financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective , and this is not the case for the following reasons : poorly defined selection criteria , dubious uncoordinated operations , assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy .    3.5463262452415885
we are therefore proposing to amend the regulations as follows .    3.2467500702005334
firstly , to reserve the acquisitions made thanks to life funds exclusively to public bodies , subsequently , following invitation to tender , to UNK the management of these sites to authorised nature conservation associations .    3.296240350271741
it is a question of the continuity of the ownership of the acquisitions , since private law associations may disappear or UNK acquisitions .    2.721269744174685
it is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100 % public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership , even under cover of environmental protection .    3.1486913653868402
secondly , to define the criteria for the eligibility and allocation of life funds , in order to rule our any suspicions of UNK or UNK .    3.7186313508883924
thirdly , to make prior coordination with the users and communities concerned a prerequisite .    3.712528448700392
for example , the life - nature project in france , at grand - UNK lake , planned without any coordination , led to a real ecological disaster , the de - silting operation which was carried out without regard for french law on the subject caused significant silting of the UNK , a water course located downstream , destroying spawning beds , UNK UNK , and who knows what else .    3.574257683479913
the UNK was in fact shifted 3 kilometres , at a cost of ff 6 million , the cure being worse than the disease , and a consequence that was foreseeable and actually predicted by the parties involved with the site .    3.6103341648430534
this is the sort of thing that we want to avoid .    3.6239687227415693
four , to include representatives of parliament in the monitoring committee , at least one member per political group .    4.186829398241401
what could be fairer than for members of parliament to monitor the use of the appropriations they voted for ?    3.9416549215303553
fifthly , to publish an annual scientific , technical and financial assessment of life operations carried out .    3.068632357654823
six , to carry out proper evaluation of the programmes on a regular basis .    4.042112206324569
seven , to make it possible for these funds to be used in the event of an environmental emergency : for example , in reforestation following storm damage , or restoration of the natural environment following an oil slick , etc .    3.988378624449712
here , mrs lienemann , mr president , we are putting forward here a practical proposal , a common sense proposal , easy to implement , likely to limit local conflicts and to UNK the proper use of public monies , before increasing the life budget line by as much as 40 % !    3.85345220185481
mr president , commissioner , i would firstly like to congratulate mrs lienemann on the report she has carried out , and also the commission - why not ? - because this report , this position , generally improves on the texts in force .    3.4495760264168664
furthermore , it contains more acceptable UNK and is clearer and more transparent .    2.9570068543311785
i would also like to congratulate the services of the commission , since the evaluation , control and monitoring of the life programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects .    3.8644470907857267
however , i would like to insist on certain points .    2.497055292994488
firstly , its continuity , which , in principle , i am not questioning .    4.199752445129978
secondly , the financial contributions .    3.578227825247136
sadly , only 7 . 2 % of the projects requested receive funds .    3.6992097199990246
of the eur 1 UNK million requested , only eur UNK million have been granted .    3.4700014816263756
now the financial statement shows only eur 613 million to cover more countries and competences .    3.064334525191101
parliament has proposed eur 850 million , but the document repeats the initial proposal of eur 613 million .    3.4017202250681655
commissioner , our environmental commitments are increasing in all areas , while the only financial instrument exclusively dedicated to the environment is decreasing .    4.0677243260484905
is this not a contradiction ?    3.3682477081199127
let us not demand from others what we are not prepared to give ourselves ?    3.7634212140509353
why do we all go on about the environment and are then not prepared to pay for it amongst all of us , but rather expect the usual people , the ones who live there all year , to pay for it and maintain it ?    3.7433004209208187
commissioner , we must be consistent .    3.9326018389740414
the cost of maintaining the environment , which we all enjoy , must be met by all of us , and the life programme is the only financial instrument aimed exclusively at the environment and whose projects have generally been effective .    4.95934017817118
mr president , life has been the principal instrument available to the community since 1992 for supporting and developing environmental policy , both within the community and in the surrounding third countries .    4.325368297585681
on the basis of the experience gained over the past eight years , an attempt is being made to increase the effectiveness of action on behalf of the environment in the third development phase of that financial instrument .    3.9986810123951275
the funding of activities for the implementation , adaptation and development of community policy in the environment sector and the incorporation of the environment in other policies , particularly ones that contribute towards sustainable development , are central elements of the regulation we are to vote upon .    4.063715861155645
an important element of life - nature , which mainly concerns the realisation of the natura 2000 network , is the introduction of a multinational approach to formulating plans for international projects and activities , so as to avoid the fragmentation of UNK and to offer better protection of biodiversity .    3.5667004488192617
in the second , life - environment strand , which is more concerned with projects involving small and medium - sized enterprises and local government agencies , the incorporation of the environment in other policies is expressed very clearly indeed .    3.528445330405499
as regards the financing package for the implementation of life over the next five years , i wholeheartedly support the increase from eur 613 million to eur 850 million proposed by the rapporteur , mrs lienemann .    3.5907901529766133
besides , we cannot remain indifferent towards the increased challenges in areas around the union or towards addressing very acute environmental protection problems in the applicant countries .    3.3950663732437434
what has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the danube and its tributary has been instructive .    3.0544962973027148
consequently , i consider that support for environmental action under the life financial instrument will help to further community policy in the environmental sector and can contribute substantially to fulfilling the community ' s mission of achieving a high level of environmental protection and improvement .    3.6352888600016757
mr president , i should like to begin by congratulating mrs lienemann on her sensitive approach towards the environment , ably demonstrated in the two reports we have discussed this evening .    2.9438062561996436
two minutes is certainly not long enough to deal with such an important topic .    3.9017697995072083
so i will simply appeal to the commissioner to undertake full responsibility for such an important issue .    4.101592008484381
for five years , i have been the representative of the committee on the environment in a regional organisation , which assuredly does not have parliament ' s broad perspective .    5.0341379874001575
the environment is in a UNK state .    4.423549365290693
like a number of previous speakers , i , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects , which , in my view , should be incorporated into the UNK domain .    4.641742128692257
as regards funding , eur 613 million is not enough . even eur 850 million is not enough .    3.1192492886460434
at the end of august 1999 , i took part in a meeting of the committee of the environment in which it was said that eur 2 million , or itl 4 000 billion , should go towards eliminating or , at any rate , reducing smoking .    3.5408327488715035
however , the environment constitutes a far bigger and more serious problem than smoking .    3.0753224342263104
eur 850 million - assuming that such a figure is actually agreed - believe me , is not enough , in practical terms , to allow any type of project to be carried out .    3.995060573506865
in many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the life programme have been established .    3.8082378734687854
but creating parks with very limited financial resources , without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual .    3.2566906861825915
i would therefore ask parliament and the commission to give the matter their full attention .    3.2034630724164783
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , ever since the beginning of 1999 , discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as life .    3.4163700140641877
i would again thank the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy and mrs lienemann for the good and constructive co - operation we have had on this matter .    3.1329916964748583
as a result of this , i can confirm that the commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .    3.0476310418625245
the commission welcomes , above all , amendments nos 1 , 2 , 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 and 13 , which apply to the committee procedures .    2.833346748084394
in these cases , parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the commission had to the common position .    4.440134077509308
the commission can , in principle , also approve amendment no 4 which ought , however , to be introduced into another place in the text .    4.468592040276534
with regard to amendments nos 5 and 6 , i want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water , together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect , are to a large degree covered by life .    3.597141425170075
the commission nonetheless considers that , if this is stated separately , then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas .    4.212837995888236
there is also a risk of overlap with other community programmes such as the fifth framework programme for research , technical development and demonstration .    3.322980375469863
the present programme ' s key measures - water quality , tomorrow ' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions .    3.4967102753919765
where the question of the budget is concerned , i am pleased about the confidence shown by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy .    3.2550094611211042
amendment no 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position .    2.9369301770302085
i am also convinced that life has great potential .    2.859301910327483
this instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget .    3.13593050719418
the amount quoted in amendment no 12 does not , however , UNK with the budget set on the basis of agenda 2000 .    4.244250004175748
allow me also to add that , if the budget is increased , greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the directorate - general for the environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with .    3.9433135184117822
account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision - making procedure .    4.567998222295375
at this stage , the commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position .    3.71354978046339
with regard to amendment no 3 , which we did not approve at first reading , i want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives , conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid .    4.1986080628946185
it is therefore meaningless , and often impossible , directly to transfer projects from life to other instruments .    2.9642841799444812
if other sources of finance were to be investigated for each project , more resources would , moreover , be required than are available in the present situation .    3.901012193533293
now that the commission has to consider carefully what resources are required for each activity , this is an example of the kind of activity we ought to avoid : one that is UNK but demanding in terms of resources .    4.640322136353702
nor can the commission approve amendment no 14 , which is contrary to the commission ' s right of initiative .    4.4766054605472805
with regard to the discussion concerning the deadline , i want to say that the final date for beginning to implement life - 31 march 2000 , as set in the common position - must now be moved forward .    3.653230182595613
the date will be fixed as soon as the present regulation has been adopted .    3.4883678240014815
finally , i want to repeat that i am convinced that life will be an effective instrument in support of development and the implementation of the community ' s environmental policy .    4.16019773349335
i am convinced that you share my wish that it should be possible to adopt the regulation as soon as possible , especially in view of the fact that there are great expectations in the member states and in other countries , especially among the applicant states which are now being given the opportunity to participate in life .    4.340551092908624
thank you , mrs wallström .    2.375292509881382
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 a . m .    1.6572241642992718
modernising social protection    5.761642013886539
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0033 / 2000 ) , by mr andersson on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the communication from the commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection [ com ( 1999 ) 347 - c5 - 0253 / 1999 - 1999 / 2182 ( cos ) ] .    2.2261716196443317
mr president , the issue of social security systems is an important one .    3.4296964111666686
this is a natural consequence of cooperation within the eu .    3.0930603052568424
the basis is monetary cooperation , which has since been followed up by macro - economic cooperation and cooperation on employment policy .    3.7982912504709754
it is now a natural consequence to move on to social security systems .    3.0910794106121533
these areas are mutually dependent upon one another .    2.948050877762293
economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment .    3.6078828064934156
it also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision .    3.4287231986150575
but the reverse is also the case : a well - developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth .    3.847556191595736
in other words , social security is a factor of production .    3.400823917120457
social security systems differ from one eu country to another .    3.3706968650923685
this is largely due to historical factors .    2.9380671491763097
the labour market is also changing .    3.0804606843173143
another challenge is presented by technical development .    3.2590552747095405
we must meet these challenges together .    3.1927105307631862
the commission ' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared , a high - level group formed and benchmarking introduced .    2.9391104461121302
what is more , the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment .    3.8267544612802693
this is good , but it is not enough .    3.4959552515644368
we propose a procedure like the luxembourg process .    3.2580288103188932
we are creating a common model , but retaining the principle of subsidiarity .    2.942442486074923
this social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period .    3.9389443727267346
parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high - level group , but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on .    4.70529538170353
like the work on employment , the commission ' s proposal is founded upon four pillars .    3.99662639500308
these are : to make the systems employment - friendly ; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term ; to promote social integration ; and to guarantee sustainable , high - quality health and medical care .    3.6378360284160594
all this is important .    3.3121538473333434
in our report , we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the eu and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area .    4.390233510903016
equality has no pillar of its own .    3.556684521821304
there , it is mainstreaming which applies .    4.569390279201228
all four pillars should reflect aspects of equality .    3.1770447689310237
this is something we have borne in mind .    3.0007082881130542
we are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect , for example , that there should be a transition to UNK social security systems ; that UNK leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems ; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life ; and that the basic old - age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living .    3.917769305310475
these proposals favour women especially .    3.110910436607918
we expect the commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme .    4.0022934950101146
the commission ought to consider UNK a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement .    3.3505119024800116
we have had a constructive discussion in the committee .    3.3990333974438753
we had a lot of amendments , but succeeded in agreeing upon a report .    3.3843068406907264
now , the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen .    3.7799867769416555
a number of these amendments have come back from the committee reading , and these i shall reject .    3.887527610049957
i shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the technical group of independent members , because i do not think that these add anything to the report .    3.79825307781458
on the other hand , my group will applaud amendment no 14 from the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party .    2.575249697653058
i think this proposal is a good one .    4.069843081161401
certainly , it resembles amendment no 1 , but amendment no 14 is better .    3.1071442288914013
finally , i want to say that the eu is not only concerned with cooperation on trade .    3.7527201527935268
the eu is also a union for employment and social justice .    4.623632791989244
in creating a citizens ' europe , social policy has an important role to play .    3.2298490636747066
by means of this report , parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of european society .    3.6635171899425543
we hope that the council and the commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy .    3.317330376938512
the lisbon summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind .    3.6722301099784516
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr andersson , very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion .    2.968967610914943
in the capacity of coordinator of the european people ' s party in the committee on employment and social affairs , i am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which mr andersson put so much effort into .    3.5975738807609563
i am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report .    3.410333734267777
the goal of the commission ' s notification of june 1999 , on which the andersson report is based , is to reinforce cooperation between the member states and the eu in terms of social protection .    4.620511405219193
key sub - goals are : promoting employment and ensuring that work UNK a fixed income ; secondly , safeguarding old - age pensions and making these affordable ; thirdly , promoting social integration and fourthly , guaranteeing affordable , first - rate health protection .    3.0958967959387396
gender - related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals .    3.45023028427571
the commission ' s communication is an important strategic document for bringing about european social convergence .    3.1219108370434956
macro - economic policy , employment policy and social policy all affect each other and this is why they should be brought more closely together .    4.049878540508019
the commission has recognised this UNK .    3.1393575911317657
it is our intention to bring about an integrated social strategy which is , of course , underpinned by a sound macro - economic strategy and a sound employment strategy .    3.2493725067552788
these aspects are very much interconnected .    3.8648773024959504
it is , therefore , surprising that this topic has , to date , not been incorporated in a strategy and this is why the commission ' s notification constitutes a break - through in a way .    3.9956716490902884
we should , of course , not get overly UNK about it .    3.1816824542079103
it marks the beginning , rather than the end , of a process .    4.848954088076152
some people have wondered whether our demands are too low or whether there should be more dialogue .    3.3823873233477144
but it is extremely significant for the process to be set in motion .    3.706218594093115
the issues involved are extremely important but the systems in the european union are quite different from one another .    4.114686085301179
the challenges are different .    3.112371761046336
the levels of employment are different and this is why it is very important to set the ball rolling UNK but to make steady progress nonetheless .    3.7881957556798436
in this way , we will be able to meet a number of huge challenges .    3.7607889143748974
the majority within my group is of the opinion that something like this needs to happen .    3.8301590337396725
the UNK thing about the andersson report is that it does not get bogged down with too many details of how everything should take shape ; from this perspective it is not a pie - in - the - sky report .    3.8565269973536966
there are , however , one or two aspects about which i have doubts as to whether or not we are being too specific .    4.026807040902018
i think that a number of meps will make reference to this .    3.5725804574480846
but that does not take away from the fact that the report ' s importance mainly lies in the fact that we are developing a strategy and that there is a reasonable chance that it can make a significant contribution in lisbon .    4.602499183077485
i believe that if it were to be adopted in lisbon in this way , lisbon will turn out to be a success .    3.9691662622576356
if it is not adopted , lisbon will not add much to what has already been said in the past .    3.9668166257459547
as far as this is concerned , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of lisbon , because it is really innovative , while many other things are merely a UNK of what has been said before .    3.965482206211532
all in all , i am indebted to the rapporteur and the committee for this report .    4.421493605207484
i hope that europe , in terms of social protection , will make a step forward , taking into account subsidiarity , for without subsidiarity , this would not be possible .    4.081049601929354
commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , like my fellow mep , UNK pronk , please allow me to thank the commission for this communication and , in particular , to congratulate our rapporteur for the work he has put into this report .    3.72557658034246
commissioner , the fact that this report is no longer controversial within parliament does not mean that it has lost any of its crucial importance .    4.860432117847052
there have been times within this parliament when such discussions on social security were actually quite awkward .    3.383975540919302
it is also a timely discussion - as mr pronk said just a moment ago - at a time when preparations are in full swing for the lisbon summit , which intends to find out how we can put economic growth , employment and social cohesion on the agenda in europe via the information society .    3.719602138086591
within my group , it speaks for itself that social protection forms an important part of this social cohesion and should thus also be added to the agenda in lisbon .    3.8056898716683114
my group is pleased that the social affairs council gave the go - ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that , in fact , a group of high - ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the council an initial report by june 2000 .    3.718870930812181
however , we , the parliament and , in particular , the group of the social democrats , want lisbon to go one step further now .    3.845722251031747
it is of great importance that , in our fellow mep ' s report , this european parliament advocates a true european strategy of social convergence , based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so - called luxembourg strategy , that is to say it should UNK common goals , guidelines , national action plans and performance evaluations .    3.939929726774735
we believe that this course of action is ambitious , yet achievable .    3.1507438693062726
needless to say , it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at european level .    3.609514822195692
the financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this , and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the european agenda , and why , in fact , scenarios such as UNK UNK ' UNK member state or the european social snake have scarcely got off the ground .    4.123811436261569
but this new course of action is very exciting .    3.302816478520832
the employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary , for our social security systems are facing the same challenges , and in an emu era , social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition .    4.005089899124339
but let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group : social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation .    3.837809594459324
they can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the commission in terms of social legislation .    4.6360036123868325
i think that it also a good thing if , moreover , the european parliament tried to convince the council to UNK the common strategy as early on as in lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001 .    3.787340208732482
i am pleased about the fact that the european parliament supports my group ' s idea and we hope , commissioner , that we can also count on your support .    3.9195159557758323
finally , we urge the european parliament , both sides of industry and social ngos to be closely involved in this process .    3.668350531389869
the success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support .    3.233517335963681
mr president , the four chief objectives which the eu countries ' governments endorsed in november of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows : that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income ; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable ; that social integration should be promoted ; and that sustainable , high - quality health care should be guaranteed .    3.4859450232544407
these are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them . having a group of high - ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from .    3.5344485253838513
the commission ' s communication , which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the council in november , is a well - balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the member states in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the union .    4.012802382433706
we now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets , which is a problem for many member states .    3.627619057087745
if reforms are not got under way , we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy , and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security .    4.261347604342788
it is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda .    2.894498649791834
in the debate about coordination of social policy in the eu , we often use the expression social convergence .    4.4034562298243864
as liberals , we can support this concept when it means that we in the eu are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies .    4.19026529266393
it is not , therefore , about harmonisation but about common objectives .    3.0405630478925536
it is , of course , a fact that the eu countries have different ways of organising social policy .    3.692517838448872
we have different traditions and there are differences in culture and , in spite of there being many points of UNK , there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned . it is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern .    4.263220002467067
national policy is , of course , subject to a number of common parameters . that is the case with minimum social entitlements , which are established by treaty .    4.819184596041161
it is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements . it applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies ; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation .    3.883640779504261
so coordination and cooperation are facts of life . but convergence should be about goals , not means .    3.4829397056148
i should also like to thank the rapporteur , jan andersson , for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report .    3.2568456433421753
i can support the report , but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste .    4.8329783992148805
i do not agree with the requirement that the commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems , if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient , or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many eu countries .    3.9346803635712244
i am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the commission ' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly , and i am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold .    3.749499876901051
dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be UNK , but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same . there should be room for a multiplicity of solutions .    4.792998495715421
mr president , commissioner , with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security , i would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me .    3.967393495308748
i feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier .    3.5342743422500957
this seems to be a good thing and useful .    3.989955654483092
i also feel positive about the essence of the communication , namely the strategic approach .    3.4665681745842103
we therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved .    3.3278470312756943
we would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled . on the one hand , it would be useful to have guidelines and a process UNK on luxembourg , but we also think it is important , as is already mentioned by mrs van lancker , that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios , such as sole traders , etc .    3.671983622305298
we nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found .    3.570196447972931
i can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the european union .    3.0508376620941995
it appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments , in fact , the majority of them , appear to be downward adjustments , the remainder being improvements .    3.4502732047514755
the lion ' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans : eleven restrictions and two improvements .    2.806939083709027
in the case of unemployment benefits , we came across six restrictions and five improvements .    2.925471598470741
the reasons for adjustments are , for example , to improve employment , reduce social security expenditure , but are also due to policy competition and emu criteria .    3.791731180275433
policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries .    3.5172133502901546
the highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries .    3.8726054674327135
all in all , both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole .    3.362614342945438
this is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches .    3.828460238037062
to use a figure of speech , UNK is not always good for us .    4.283620822022661
mr president , i would , in turn , like to congratulate both the commission , for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security , and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled .    4.696192419623083
the european union ' s policy encompasses social policy in addition to economic and employment policy .    3.4607122914809962
so far , social policy has remained limited in terms of set - up and resources .    3.8273036786428154
but under the influence of the free movement of employees , of the internal market and of the euro , the labour markets are actually beginning to become integrated .    4.4506488012357766
this has undeniable repercussions on social protection which is tied in with labour to a large extent .    3.05498017716153
cross - border workers , employees on UNK and UNK employees , as well as job - seekers , students on placement and other students , experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement . this is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection .    4.161057359527884
in fact , the same phenomenon occurs in tax law .    2.9290704718804332
in order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping , the commission has , in my opinion , developed a well - balanced approach which UNK a UNK between harmonisation and non - intervention .    4.030342912219847
on the one hand , binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old - age pensions and on the other hand , programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non - discrimination or social exclusion .    3.270967716921694
based on a number of recommendations , reports and communications , the commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high - ranking officials .    3.746472555861062
both proposals have already been accepted by the council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time , with knowledge of all facts and / or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be UNK in the european union .    4.637221810310748
indeed , expansion , globalisation , a sharp increase in the ageing population , UNK and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable .    3.4706065652428757
denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection .    3.2189865526711157
with regard to eurosceptics and nationalists , i would say that social protection within the boundaries of a member state is not social and offers no protection .    3.5022227408731066
indeed , if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition , this would also harm social protection as a production factor .    3.8309640374588576
and less social protection means less purchasing power , fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees .    2.8848857672274377
in respect of the super - europeans , i would say that european social protection is neither UNK nor desirable .    3.649655034641811
the path which the commission is walking is , in fact , obvious .    4.76950851471273
it has the advantage of clarity , and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and UNK tune solid , UNK indicators and put forward recommendations .    3.9331858840333784
i will give my support to the commission and i hope that lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter .    4.044829311422543
mr president , mr andersson ' s report contains a lot that is of interest .    3.531300938000153
unfortunately , what is most interesting is that the report , which UNK to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy , instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere .    4.300871250316748
social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the member states .    4.153725762988618
even though the socialists , now that there are so many social democratic governments , talk much less about unemployment than they used to , the unemployment in question is still high , and this in spite of the trade boom .    4.398198103565336
something must be done so that unemployment does not turn the so - called european model into a UNK .    3.4884714251768725
social policy must facilitate employment , creating incentives for employers and employees to , respectively , provide and accept jobs .    2.9881126619208103
mr andersson ' s report demands social convergence , that is to say that systems should be increasingly standardised within and throughout the eu .    3.7009587284166887
the eu should apparently adopt what are called real convergence criteria , which would be binding and of real effect .    3.406257062037664
the eu should also , on the basis of a uniform definition of poverty thresholds , table recommendations concerning what is called the minimum acceptable subsistence level in the member states .    3.174457087433398
the eu should devise guidelines governing the quality of the job opportunities which are to be created , whatever that may mean .    3.738780550399317
it is certainly not going to be possible to reduce unemployment with all these additional regulations and forms of interference .    4.012663808227033
those structural problems which make unemployment higher in europe than in the united states will become even greater .    3.5385441052702618
there is no need at all for supranationalism in this area .    2.9771626026512505
the member states can devise their own systems in the social sphere , each within the framework of its economic resources and political preferences .    3.9290811955324707
it is most especially important not to create unnecessary problems before the enlargement of the eu .    3.1307779691238604
mr andersson thinks that the less wealthy eastern countries should be reminded that social convergence is to apply to them too .    3.436265331191882
it is obvious , however , that these countries , impoverished within a communist economic system , cannot cope with a social policy like , for example , sweden ' s .    3.963903862254189
talk of minimum regulations and poverty thresholds is meaningless to the present member states and unreasonable as far as less wealthy applicant states are concerned .    4.308756972964565
he has done a great deal of work on behalf of parliament in producing a wide - ranging consensus on what is , by any definition , a thorny issue , not just in this parliament but in virtually every member state .    3.95201539313022
i also welcome the commission ' s communication .    2.834517718169154
it was slow in coming but well worth waiting for .    2.9760825401286013
it could be a UNK in the development of a social europe , providing we take it seriously and do not allow individual member states to UNK at the steps that must be taken to implement it .    4.651060744141886
we can , and must , take the unique european social model we have and reform it to fit the twenty - first century , a century which is globalising fast .    3.1427754994242996
i am afraid the proposals that are being put forward by mr UNK schmid will not deal with that globalising world .    3.8894909594530707
to be successful we have to ensure that our economic policy , our employment policy and our social protection policy in its broadest sense , are integrated and that we deal with them as a whole .    4.250276036220045
we have to ensure that our ecofin ministers and our employment ministers acknowledge that social affairs ministers have a contribution to make to the establishment of a society in europe which is creative , has initiative and which will provide a high quality of life for all of our citizens .    3.9678459806163544
this is not an option for us any more .    3.021289840507157
it is an imperative .    3.1303203444957393
european citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings .    3.4153928125703654
we do not want the us model - a model which has UNK failed to create the employment that is necessary to provide a decent quality of life .    3.6045902800053726
that is not what we want to do in europe .    3.6504101675257243
we have the traditions of solidarity in europe and we have the experience of a better way of doing things .    4.570416336730041
but we have to grasp the tools to do that .    3.673661765492268
i therefore urge that we not only implement the high - level group as proposed by the commission but also go further and have a luxembourg - type process so that we have an integrated approach to this issue of social protection .    3.9635406370482382
mr president , commissioner , this is one of the social areas to which the european union ought to pay much more attention .    3.8575349249124002
macroeconomic policies , the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people ' s lives , specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes , particularly of the minimum pensions , and through fighting social exclusion .    3.825898403277006
this situation is particularly serious in countries such as portugal where the minimum pensions and pension schemes are barely more than half of the minimum national wage which in turn , is the lowest in the whole of europe .    3.4913140804308895
therefore , while the commission does not accept the need to amend its macroeconomic policies to create more jobs of quality , with employee rights , which is a fundamental basis for maintaining and modernising a solid , public social protection system , we harbour serious doubts as to its position .    3.8831959932627194
although the andersson report has gathered some positive proposals , including some that we put forward ourselves , we are still critical of some of the bases for the commission ' s proposal and we still have concerns about the strategy for modernising social protection .    3.753793099016729
mr president , in my previous life i ran two manufacturing businesses , one in the united kingdom and one in the netherlands .    3.6037485279552133
as the uk business grew , we invested in more people , as the dutch business grew we invested in more machinery .    3.3319960362348846
the simple reason for this was that social costs in the netherlands were just too high in comparison .    3.9019979164518923
i am in favour of social protection , i am in favour of the original commission document , but i do not want to see people UNK out of jobs because social protection costs become UNK high .    3.9646078048840874
that is why in committee i proposed some form of business impact assessment , so that costs and risks to jobs could be taken into account , and the epp - de group supported this amendment .    3.9272211879195784
but i must record that other groups , led by the pse group , guided by my countryman , UNK UNK , voted this out .    3.276185381197929
i accept that mr andersson ' s report is very well - intentioned , and i respect him for the work he has done , but in my view the way the report defines and promotes social convergence would drive social costs higher throughout the eu .    4.1085784620038215
this would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this house by showing how remote we are from the real world .    3.618703487845627
mr president , we are unable to vote for this report .    2.8477034096053426
the european union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of europe .    3.128931993941609
social rights should determine economic choices , and not the other way around .    3.9705278319585906
this is why , when it comes to social protection , we are opposed to schemes copied from the luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale : broad economic guidelines , then convergence criteria and , finally , social issues , dealt with as the last resort .    3.498563097325334
the european union should proclaim one general principle , to wit , that the social rights acquired in member states may not be restricted .    4.0006244006799685
any community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator .    3.2606372164615642
in order to strengthen the funding of social security systems , we need a policy of general wage increase , the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each member state .    3.89136371832278
in order to fight poverty , entitlement to an income and to employment are UNK rights .    3.2262360600170723
finally , in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity , the european union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system .    4.1036155175792945
i sincerely hope , in conclusion , that social europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes .    3.2867569398789613
for millions of people the situation is too tragic for that .    4.0591827452578295
mr president , commissioner , the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the european union is certainly an UNK one . just as the launching of a european convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the luxembourg summit was commendable .    3.408561245400048
the labour market and social protection are , in fact , two sides of the same coin , that require harmonised policies and rules .    3.644741793058019
if the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment , flexibility and salary discipline , then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function , and vice versa .    3.684638346270586
until recently , the european countries fixed , it could be said in an UNK way , the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets .    4.623246936883849
with the maastricht treaty and the single currency , budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to UNK UNK as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness .    3.5450056546717654
the structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot , therefore , be UNK through budget deficits and trade .    4.052011927740792
that being the case , in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the union , and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level , it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic UNK , the so - called UNK UNK shocks .    3.9000017821303237
and therein lies the paradox .    3.3634652059567176
political and monetary convergence in europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems .    3.6097270487290873
but , at the same time , the single currency and the absence of labour mobility , as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy , force us into a situation of non - convergence in terms of salaries and welfare , in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels .    3.4657109662506453
hypocrisy and fine - sounding words such as convergence , benchmarking , modernisation and concerted action are not going to UNK us from those contradictions .    3.408133572889882
either the european union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources , genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes , or it would be better not to deceive and be UNK by hopeless UNK to convergence which sound impressive but which , in reality , only cause harm , above all to the most vulnerable .    4.220503439133978
that is something we would do well to recognise .    3.062616958711054
mr president , unlike several of those who have spoken in today ' s debate , i am inclined to endorse the andersson report , one of the reasons for this being that i can see clear differences between the report and the commission ' s communications .    4.589075855845477
in particular , i am referring to the fact that this report - and i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the european social model ' s approach , which is one based on solidarity .    4.038699560008015
i would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping , together with the right to a basic level of social security , the goal of social convergence , and , in particular , the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy .    3.8177906418904195
i can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the european union , and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity - based revival of the european social state , model .    3.9146942241695886
all in all , though , i deem this report to be worthwhile .    3.4017132461280277
mr president , i have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection , which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of europe .    3.9337620753932336
this message is contained in the excellent report by mr andersson .    3.3727342083527536
i believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it , but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged .    4.2594893108710234
bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income , i believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the european union .    4.077034843812383
let us not forget that , in 1999 , UNK , 000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate .    3.6123425947672687
in social terms , it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience , as president UNK recently stated in spain .    4.788139836728413
we must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes , mergers , take - overs , new technologies etc .    3.3043638688624113
what is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs , for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity , because sometimes , as the title of the film states , the postman always rings twice .    3.7793476344761894
in my humble opinion , it is the responsibility of all european , national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion .    4.598531727335181
it seems to me , commissioner , that the commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities .    4.003395436851973
mr president , i should like to congratulate mr andersson on his really excellent work , which is the reason why there is broader agreement , and i also thank the members of parliament involved for their contribution .    3.835288522032701
today , we have the statement by mr andersson .    4.014160375271496
i believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection .    3.9748903999784972
the second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the european commission can operate .    4.38237977915867
you know very well that the treaty provides no legal basis for policies at european level , but there is the agreement expressed at the last council , there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience , as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the member states .    4.099252868493926
the third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses , which relate to paid work , the sustainability of pension systems , social convergence and lastly quality in health care , there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies .    3.9821738398272153
the next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken .    3.4653916649245384
as you know , a high - level group has already been set up by the portuguese presidency , which will present its first report to the summit conference in june .    4.006394130055497
the portuguese presidency has focused on two things : sustainable pension systems and social accession .    3.1524011346351366
i believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high - level group .    3.652942916254376
concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems , the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the member states , i should like to say that in europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion .    4.301379442617448
of course , we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness , but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment .    4.061914511771023
i think the statement ' s content makes this clear .    3.0904384281160024
ladies and gentlemen , the aim is that in the next year , and after a unanimous decision by the council , we should progress to a first level of coordination , exchange of views , listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies .    4.34364198050405
as many of the speakers have said , i believe a first important step has been taken .    4.821867606844359
already at the intergovernmental conference , social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and i believe we are in a new phase , in which social policy will , to a large extent , become a european policy .    4.774163382107867
thank you , mrs diamantopoulou .    2.2940007339768114
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . 30 a . m .    1.6572241642992718
wipo treaty    5.563952587123323
the next item is the recommendation ( a5 - 0008 / 2000 ) by mrs cederschiöld , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on the proposal for a council decision on the approval , on behalf of the european community , of the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms treaty [ com ( 1998 ) 249 - c5 - 0222 / 1999 - 1998 / 0141 ( avc ) ] .    2.2016421107848747
mr president , we are now taking a stance on an important issue , an international agreement , which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many member states .    3.478118983547806
in my own country , sweden , one of our biggest export industries is affected , namely the music and sound recording industry .    3.1127388858204865
it is about artists ' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products .    2.788006688575526
without protection under intellectual property law , creativity is UNK and financial incentives obstructed .    3.323427780412408
UNK are big business .    3.3623253868454057
it is estimated that , in europe alone , income of eur 4 . 5 billion is lost because of UNK .    3.671060236545501
the problem affects a lot of jobs in the UNK industry .    4.490075021673724
this is an historic agreement because the eu is the contracting party . this is the case , in spite of the fact that it is not the eu , but only the member states , which belong to the organisation .    4.335593689223841
there exists a special clause which requires parliament ' s assent in two cases .    3.8510653246851887
with regard to the present agreement , both these conditions are fulfilled .    3.367596652566522
a new institution is being created , an assembly which , in the future , will monitor the agreement and its consequences .    3.9263567394815047
the agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co - decision - making procedure .    3.411633608566503
parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence .    3.3271472944208105
the future will show whether it is right , by means of this new parliamentary assembly , to reduce the commission ' s powers regarding these issues .    4.58737627328356
parliament cannot , in any case , at present do anything about the matter .    3.6405591930553602
the agreement complements the berne convention in regard to literary works .    3.14235440912051
it creates international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the making available of works .    3.302958737019724
it also creates protection for UNK and databases .    3.279499080973309
there are problems regarding the term " author " .    3.238451563770467
for example , it has not been defined .    3.903003955623171
another issue , which is somewhat problematic , is that of intermediate storage .    4.535440610890081
this too has not been solved .    4.0367147781137716
it is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition .    3.518681429603967
if no definitions are provided in questions such as this , it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world , with no uniformity of approach .    3.935482282714884
that would not be a good thing .    3.8014269432322427
the question of UNK procedures is still to be resolved , too .    3.6514004805717994
parliament cannot change these details .    3.161977809000555
we can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands .    3.221883872507505
yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies .    3.7888447906764298
both myself , as rapporteur , and the committee think we ought to say yes .    4.647353439619254
we have here an agreement which , in spite of its defects , constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright .    4.040065865662675
we have of course discussed at length whether parliament and whether the eu should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law .    3.2376342561188736
i think they should have .    3.8608693488118777
however , there is still no community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of UNK , and there needs to be .    4.263815383305967
a european patent is in the UNK , and that is a good thing .    4.610476495212832
now , the union and the member states are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law .    4.043835606411543
it is good for us that we have the power to do this , in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied .    4.25729645183943
in that way , we can act as a model for the applicant states .    3.5240267778989858
we have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement .    3.3956079745351153
i want to thank the commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the commission ' s officials , which has been quite excellent .    4.833001126287101
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mrs cederschiöld , on her very serious work .    2.5807042090638754
their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the european union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property .    3.838322301111426
it is a fact that the road has been a long one , mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property .    3.8873442702336303
the problem has been overcome .    3.3065008143387664
today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties : the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations , performances and phonograms .    3.700955674847029
as regards the first of these , it seems to provide an effective solution for the long - standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works , while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution , rental and the presentation of their works to the public .    3.798216172945731
as regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms , it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers , interpreters and artists for reproduction , distribution and rental to the public , and the right to fair UNK for radio UNK .    3.62780764624462
in that context a UNK and important step forward is the treaty ' s treatment of the right of reproduction .    3.8511241021139835
even though , as the commission says , the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development , it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created , performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the treaty of rome or even by the community directives .    3.6118897945033446
interpreting article 7 of the treaty , we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in UNK , but also protection against UNK , whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary , and protection against any other form of production .    3.688291728082675
it would be appropriate , however , for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future wipo work or the work of other diplomatic conferences .    4.210099420672514
first , there is the right of distribution as referred to in article 8 ( 1 ) .    3.9050008682744015
the option accorded to states by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the treaty ' s most negative points , since there is nothing to prevent states from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right , a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists .    3.944914447674743
as regards rental rights , on interpretation of article 9 , we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists , interpreters or performers , only if this is laid down by national legislation . i think this conflicts with article 13 .    3.5648918290453473
to conclude , i want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights .    2.7909540042675274
in the 21st century , the century of knowledge and the invisible economy , intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will , in many cases , be more important than traditional property .    3.584844362463379
we are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created , where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large .    3.8508829181567283
mr president , i should like to thank our rapporteur for this excellent report which , nonetheless , concludes that , as a community , our accession to these two wipo treaties must not UNK down to a mere institutional development , however important that may be , i . e . the opportunity for the european community and the wipo assembly to work together .    4.048409985685867
this ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of europe .    4.292565586984184
however , an objective is emerging behind this issue of community accession , one i find as yet too theoretical but one that some member states , nonetheless , find too offensive .    3.5563710387449086
this is the affirmation of a european cultural policy . in this connection , i expect our three institutions , parliament , the commission and the council , to be in agreement .    4.3300093135187065
cultural policy means , in particular , defending the role of the arts , recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards .    3.9488584105902818
in addition , at a time when europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights , there is an urgent need - as has just been pointed out several times - to define and redefine what exactly an author is .    3.676319344322361
our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them .    3.731820869102983
mr president , commissioner , the adoption of the wipo agreements was a very positive step in the direction of the global information society .    3.3129590838693166
the agreements UNK the decades - old legacy of copyright , and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights .    3.268778989418289
the entry into force of the treaties and their final form is , however , in addition to this recommendation , dependent on implementation by the parties themselves .    3.9350472866634356
in the united states the wipo treaty has already entered into force , having been UNK into law by means of the digital millennium corporate act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the treaty by means of this legislation .    3.9299307922591824
the eu too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the wipo .    3.785477029423617
it is worrying that the position adopted by the previous parliament does not support this balanced wipo system .    3.4315549329468036
the opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted , and , furthermore , the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of europeans .    4.028198960627179
parliament ' s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old , in excess of 80 % market share to a new environment with rigid , excessive copyright regulations .    3.427732725348407
i am not now speaking of charlotte cederschiöld ' s recommendation , which is an excellent paper , but of the matters of copyright that the previous parliament discussed .    3.756113239239721
on one point of detail , i would like to thank mrs cederschiöld for having clarified , for example , the concept of so - called temporary copies in her opinion .    3.774115192942704
there is no UNK adopted position in the wipo treaty on temporary copies .    3.2311599133068487
if these , which technically speaking are copies , were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information - as the recommendation quite rightly states - expensive and complicated for no good reason .    3.4766003317510563
it would be as if the UNK had to pay a copyright UNK whenever he carried a book to be read by the UNK .    3.4733419726508585
the real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the UNK directly to the user , the consumer .    3.316178276274415
the new operational environment is , above all , a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before .    3.56798991266689
it is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account .    2.9523826134240507
parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation .    3.9508605655377016
. ( nl ) mr president , i would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur on the work that she has carried out .    3.109518649314099
this is important .    2.614638483428804
it befits the commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur .    4.501120734991843
i would like to present the commission ' s conclusion to you without any further UNK : it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and , therefore , with ratification by this parliament .    3.949725666497711
i would like to stress the importance of both treaties .    2.833200459891976
both the wipo copyright treaty and the wipo performances and phonograms treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are , as such , a considerable improvement on the berne convention and the treaty of rome .    3.0519487479923204
both treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters , but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks .    3.410467320251309
the two treaties explicitly permit the community to become a party to the treaties and to play an important role in managing them .    3.9028871290429836
consequently , approval of the treaties by the community is of major importance , because it illustrates that the community sets great store by intellectual property rights .    4.293117882295415
in addition , assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the european union ' s role in terms of copyright .    3.814417848336032
at international level , there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly .    3.6203055348317976
these have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen wipo member states , including the united states .    3.4248011892477397
the entry into force of treaties largely depends on the european union , because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect , and these acts that are signed by the european union and the member states , including associated countries , are of vital importance in order to reach this number .    4.043361306773328
the developing countries , too , expect the european union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide .    4.465319094281066
in this context , parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the information society , which led to the approval of the UNK report in february 1999 .    3.8822043127976005
this directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the wipo treaties .    3.2782878107224693
the european parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of article 300 ( 3 ) .    3.0357748224655414
in a nutshell , i would like to reiterate the commission ' s conclusion here : it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property .    3.6358330077613656
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 . UNK . m .    2.165573871311477
( the sitting was closed at 11 . 55 p . m . )    1.9762429974630247
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.3506184552294846
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .    1.9245484651696183
mr president , i see in the minutes that two members spoke yesterday about delayed flights to strasbourg on monday .    3.0493417946320034
i would like to add that the flight from amsterdam ' s UNK airport was also delayed and then cancelled .    2.889682519386972
we were diverted to UNK - UNK airport .    3.7870868590831295
we were told that a bus would meet us there on arrival .    2.764120035758268
in fact , it took 45 minutes after we arrived before the bus appeared at the airport .    2.755877625230259
we finally got here , on monday at 8 . 30 p . m . , after some of us had spent more than 12 hours travelling .    3.281394221528428
this sort of service and difficulty in getting to strasbourg on a monday is quite hopeless .    3.2138120403389334
if the french government insists that we continue to meet in strasbourg , it could at least ensure , where flights are diverted to basle , that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted UNK , otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on monday and attend to any kind of business .    3.7615187873601412
i wonder if that could be added to the minutes .    3.139454460950755
mr president , i was UNK on the same flight and i am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was UNK , our national airline company .    3.9868839483149325
i hope that next time , also if any other airline company is involved , things will run more smoothly .    2.9915740400188535
( the minutes were approved )    1.9577163372853157
mr president , i would just like to draw your attention to something that concerns today ' s agenda . we decided on monday that the council ' s statement on the UNK anniversary of the geneva convention was to be postponed .    3.2689316184822554
i would just like to clarify that we will only be talking about the other items on this agenda today , and not about the geneva convention .    4.389493146043632
this item has been postponed until the next part - session in march .    3.080906767408336
it was UNK included in today ' s agenda .    2.7795088365189544
mr swoboda , i can confirm what you have just said and there is , in fact , a printing error .    4.149223945334127
the document that has been distributed contains UNK , because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate .    4.317227566273459
mr president , i just want to say that , as i was walking in this morning , i noticed two people smoking outside the hemicycle .    3.1932655669926895
the smell is absolutely UNK !    3.47750468558521
can you please do something about it ?    3.2397731769582596
i cannot do anything about it myself , but you are quite right . we need a quick way of educating people , including those who do not UNK the rules decided upon in this house .    3.9349452941404617
regarding the problems caused by air travel delays , perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching strasbourg for the present part - session should form a small group - although i am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered .    3.6934622916752
coherence of eu policies with development    3.6256704378433957
the next item is the statement by the council and the commission on the coherence of eu policies with development .    2.6163024338157985
mr president , it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the council presidency , particularly in view of the very important role that the european parliament is bound to play in the near future , given the need to strengthen development policies at european union level .    4.495436388894897
the subject of the statement that i have the honour of presenting to you today , is the coherence of different union policies with development policy .    3.633594776426414
i shall , of course , give the commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that i shall be making . i would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel , at eu level , to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years , which has benefited people in all walks of life , throughout the world , in terms of well - being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that , at the same time , there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world .    4.289961821294878
this UNK the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace .    4.024832603857538
we are all therefore duty - bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet .    3.4556633326275095
the consequence of all this is a UNK of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets .    4.796478640771802
a serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged , which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments , which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies .    3.8375614417661796
we will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and i would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas :    3.734994884727282
firstly , there will be a need for more concerted action between all international players , by which i mean donors , requiring greater coordination , greater coherence and improved links between humanitarian aid and development policies ; it will also require strengthening of the multilateral system and greater attention being paid to indebtedness and to financing and development problems .    3.2331415869112536
at the same time , however , there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate , particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems , together with a need to focus special attention on these countries ' own policies for reducing poverty .    3.9943581017796608
the second aspect of this new model for development policies relates to the need for a more integrated approach to development .    3.4444237166729526
this means not just an approach limited to development aid as the sole element of this policy , but a policy that also increasingly takes account of the role of other policies in the spheres of finance , trade and investment . furthermore , this new model must respect the need for this integrated vision of development to be approached both from a global policy angle and also in the light of the various donor countries ' own policies .    4.097375341421416
a third aspect of this new model that i would like to emphasise is a policy aimed at achieving our objectives .    3.5873108369052993
since 1995 , following a concerted international effort between the main donor states , involving in particular a reflection paper produced by the oecd ' s development assistance committee , it has been possible to establish some important objectives by way of guidelines for development policies , both at national and international level .    3.6782840466411972
as you will know , the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50 % by UNK , by increasing compulsory schooling , by significantly reducing child mortality rates , and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective .    3.538959052313117
this would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world ' s population lives , and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people . this is an extraordinary state of affairs , which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively .    4.4686280027057945
and that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that i would like to emphasise . particularly in recent years , development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter , and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership .    3.7108801070121094
the concerted actions of the united nations institutions have played an important role here , as has the bretton woods system .    4.055722401349455
i have in mind , in particular , the important impetus given to this debate by the world bank , especially through its comprehensive framework document , and by the international monetary fund , where , for the first time , an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto UNK link , for a body of this type , between debt relief and poverty .    4.031463480071542
this new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the european union in this context .    4.249152217115983
the portuguese presidency has highlighted the need for the european union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies , and to create greater scope for coordination , in particular with the united nations system and the bretton woods system .    4.109613397541825
if we are to strengthen the european union ' s role in international development policies , we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action .    3.26067306181727
firstly , we need to make the eu ' s development policy more effective .    3.1931631534371236
as you know , an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies , and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the german presidency .    3.735478936623011
the main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent eu policy and a more strategic overall eu approach to development issues .    3.7670102577820095
the key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies , the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the union ' s present cooperation policies , the need to make the eu ' s aid management more efficient and , in particular , to review its mechanisms for intervention , and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid .    4.068005337224871
a second aspect worth highlighting UNK the need for eu policy and the policies of the member states to complement each other more .    4.194782831258801
it is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the member states ' national policies , which are not always complementary or well coordinated . a great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the european union and its member states is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual member states and the proposals and actions of the european institutions .    3.878815816117636
in this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost , as soon as possible , to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the member states and european union policies are coordinated and complementary .    4.250685942095547
the third aspect i would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of eu policies , the central theme of today ' s debate .    3.101341489958186
firstly , we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other european union policies , so that development objectives can be achieved , not merely through aid and support , but also , first and foremost , through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development .    4.315177635259676
as you know , a council resolution was approved , in june 1997 , under which the commission was required to present evaluation reports .    3.6134283298987575
the first such report was presented to the council in may 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration .    4.032022039006008
but as you will also be aware , we are waiting for a commission communication on coherence , together with the communication on development policy .    5.132022844935973
over the coming months , that is to say during the portuguese presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the commission has undertaken to present to us .    3.826603240018898
it is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the european union . only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies .    3.8123958562528975
but , quite apart from this , we would like to emphasise that , if we are to strengthen the coherence of european union policies in the present circumstances and in the economic situation currently facing the union , we need to give serious consideration to various issues associated with the dynamics of the european union itself .    4.811572309005752
by this i mean , of course , the internal dynamics of the european union .    3.076339964287431
we know that the european union has its own dynamics , which stem above all from the treaty of amsterdam , which has reinforced its political dimension . this inevitably has important consequences for the proposal for coherence in policies relating to development .    3.849846007523352
we will also have to await the outcome of the work of the intergovernmental conference as regards enlargement , to see to what extent the internal dynamics of the european union are directed towards increasing the coherence of its policies , and , as regards development in particular , to what extent it also contributes to appropriate institutional arrangements for achieving this objective .    4.279671808840944
the second aspect that we need to consider , in relation to the coherence of policies , is development policy in the context of the union ' s foreign policy .    3.8112967843078667
we know that the union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy , and we know that , with the creation of the high representative , of the rapid reaction force and of the military crisis management capacity , there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the european union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies . we also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue , with the adoption of common positions or joint actions , with the preparation of joint strategies , with preventive diplomacy , and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management .    5.062442403280871
there can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the european union ' s foreign policy .    3.196508633300267
it has to be said that , in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy , the european union is bound to go down the same road as many member states have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies .    4.221311437162198
the success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision - making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy , so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy .    4.166673583342189
in this context , we are convinced that we need to move away from the UNK model towards to a truly european model of development aid . i say this because we know that , in europe , development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain member states , in view of the post - colonial concerns of those states .    4.3722701829681005
the third aspect that needs to be considered is european union policy and member states ' policy .    3.8328977356241474
coherence of policies at european level certainly means better coordination of member states ' policies with the european union ' s development policy .    4.224284484022688
if we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies , it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in european union development policy .    3.3385637517663875
as you know , there is a UNK difference between the status of development policies and other eu policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the edf ' s financing , or rather lack of financing .    3.683053956501357
it is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the european union ' s policies without the development council playing a more active and UNK role in relation to political decisions , which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other councils , in other decision - making forums , ranging from the agriculture and fisheries councils to the environment council . up to now , the development council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions .    4.262532101706768
so without a more active role for the development council in the overall coordination of political decision making which , although it directly impacts on the european union ' s development policy , is largely being dealt with outside this decision - making forum , it will certainly be difficult to establish a more coherent european union policy on development objectives .    4.039585517722963
the views of the european parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome .    4.6972610489478654
. let me start by saying something about the successfully concluded negotiations between the eu and acp countries .    3.259585489526271
i would like to remark that it was a very positive experience taking part in those negotiations .    3.5096552189188697
i saw member states working as a team , which was indeed a wonderful experience .    3.3920655626021063
there was also deep satisfaction on both sides when this was over , not just because it was over , but because we all knew that we had achieved something together , the eu and the 71 acp countries .    3.7676619778915734
that is something that the world needs and is a very good signal in the framework of the whole discussion of globalisation .    4.172437321058871
i shall outline some of the major innovations in the new agreement .    4.589285588115773
we explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever .    4.259224593162236
we promote UNK approaches , we ensure the consultation of civil society on the reforms and policies to be supported by the eu .    3.6927241351887963
we UNK development policies on poverty reduction strategies .    3.254674353057561
we base the allocation of funds not only on an assessment of each country ' s needs , but also of its policy performance .    4.356316747781063
we create an investment facility to support the development of the private sector .    4.2249293878173395
we rationalise instruments and introduce a new system of rolling programming , allowing the community and the beneficiary country to regularly adjust their cooperation programme .    3.402466229028752
we decentralise administrative and , in some cases , financial responsibilities to local level with the aim of making cooperation more effective .    3.5885030538235414
we improve the policy framework for trade and investment development .    3.4391881843848027
after seattle i am sure you will appreciate the significance of these agreements .    3.482525457084833
let me turn to some of the more important points .    3.94519523380039
firstly the agreement on political issues .    3.7864807243227667
the new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active community support .    3.6086113798011485
secondly , a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights , democratic principles and the rule of law .    3.2333478143862937
in comparison with the current procedure , the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process , with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation .    4.196474251147876
in cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements , measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be UNK .    4.118481618749469
thirdly , the eu and the acp have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption .    3.521049817646623
this is a real innovation , both in the eu / acp context and in international relations in general .    3.564186746118319
this procedure will be applied , not only in cases of corruption involving edf money , but also more widely in any country where the ec is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development .    3.7045544132593378
it is thus not confined to ec activities .    2.9782943885370257
by adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement , the eu and the acp states are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by european taxpayers and hopefully also by european investors .    3.3231545333552264
another new theme in the acp - eu agreement is migration .    3.461997757758856
we have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area .    2.9830869784155873
this new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines UNK by the eu in accordance with the treaty of amsterdam and with the conclusions of the european council in tampere in finland in october 1999 .    3.949744311601563
the european union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions .    3.447612551857431
the agreement concluded with the acp countries paves the way for new initiatives , in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the eu , and measures facilitating their integration .    4.100188563959354
we also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration .    2.912475940783392
the eu and the acp states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining , within a framework to be negotiated with each and every acp country , the ways and means of UNK immigrants UNK present on the territories of each party .    3.278251465607532
this also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons .    3.1730153143714928
the agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid .    2.8522656837120515
we have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade - related matters .    3.4024835111096454
we have met the concerns of the acp states as far as the time - frame of the trade negotiations is concerned .    3.9985094105948504
negotiations will start no later than 2002 .    3.3194510588904964
this two - year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the acp countries ' capacity to conduct trade negotiations .    3.5873668936863257
a six - year period is UNK for these negotiations .    3.6261943207469995
we will take account of the economic and social constraints of the acp countries in two ways : firstly , through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and , secondly , by helping the acp states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity - building and cooperation in multilateral forums .    3.965782753099311
this approach will lead us to a fully wto compatible regime .    3.1398418694641417
economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their acp partners .    3.5674354429181547
domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know - how and technology will be transferred , all of which will boost the acp countries ' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy .    3.3417989130284713
in addition , the agreements with the eu will act as an anchor .    3.2360458294831282
they will lock in the economic reforms , just as national and economic reforms will be UNK by both parties ' commitments under the agreements .    3.934953103263999
the rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction .    4.068773465720315
another important aspect is the improvement of the eu ' s trade regime for all least - developed countries , 39 of which are actually in the acp group .    3.778511674974832
as regards the volume of the next edf , the eu has made its financial proposal .    3.7998540037526025
it is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make community aid more effective .    3.8738774706322814
today about eur 9 . 5 billion of previous edf resources are UNK .    3.3640119199208094
the eu is committed to mobilising these remaining balances , plus the new edf resources , over a seven - year period , that is to say , before the entry into force of the next financial protocol .    3.3163992896900294
this will enable the community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period .    3.1634926484536363
we are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity , we are moving into a period of increased activity .    3.809390948875476
such a commitment entails an in - depth reform of procedures and implementation UNK on both sides .    2.9253931272297105
there is a very real link between the reform process in the commission as such , and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the acp countries .    5.018556720450685
turning to our development policy , i would say that the global context has changed drastically .    4.294194241448281
the marginalisation of many economies , increased poverty in the world , the need for better management of environmental UNK , the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns .    3.5642721375154354
it is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves .    3.850833926548903
fortunately evaluations of ec aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges i have just mentioned .    3.3970755906452403
to focus on the input coming from the evaluations , i would mention the following problems : the objections of community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence .    3.8063792217488546
this is due to the complexity of our own structures , but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the member states .    3.6816347713287128
the commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments , procedures and institutional mechanisms .    3.628049848435329
often policies are more determined by the instruments available , than by policy objectives and clearly - defined priorities .    3.349540381854947
human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage .    4.559226419561358
on average , to manage $ us 10 million of aid there are 2 . 9 staff at the commission , compared with 4 . 3 at the world bank and between 4 and 9 in major member states .    3.371696056129478
this is a real problem : there are too many different financial instruments , each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings .    3.5724038857664273
this is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system .    3.6741775466800464
in order to face and solve these problems the community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with member states and parliament .    3.893211666209486
it is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that is , the council and parliament .    3.7366681488955558
the lack of concerted action among the 15 member states themselves and between them and the community also needs to be addressed .    3.662847102961002
by focusing the community ' s development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the member states .    3.1353235671901456
this is very much the line also just presented by minister amado .    2.957903938575403
when we talk policies nowadays , we engage in a process of convergence .    3.4713582890221586
we are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for community action .    3.637472468925314
everything has become more and more complex .    3.901684204147447
this is also true of development cooperation .    3.5816575263581107
no single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes , ranging from macro - economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross - cutting themes such as gender , environment , good governance and institutional reforms .    3.3089552920739793
it is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country .    3.341314164479927
this should be done at member state level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for community action .    3.1930048574468017
this is where we want to go .    4.1967788393253365
to identify the ec ' s priority areas of support , account has to be taken of the community ' s specific features in relation to the member states and to international institutions .    4.164959949231997
i will mention just a few : our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation ; our UNK and defence of overall community interests ; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual member states can normally do .    3.556498655745279
also , our presence on the ground : basically , i find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves , we are seen as a neutral , welcome partner for this experiment world - wide - something which nobody else can claim to be .    3.5297484543449325
we will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested .    4.42284358655557
i see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate .    3.4463119747528923
parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect .    3.721882992025702
this will be an ongoing process which i see as a kind of continued quality control effort and i invite parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing .    3.8397471827591176
mr president , i would firstly like to thank mr amado and mr nielson .    2.4781284098235865
the problem , however , should not be sought within this parliament or the commission ; it is the council that needs to make a decision on the edf budget . this UNK , therefore , really belongs in the council .    5.129562342661684
mr president , i thank mr nielson .    2.9450963099512157
he has talked extensively about the new lomé convention , although this is not really the topic of this morning ' s meeting .    3.9582945773218654
we want to talk about coherence .    3.3944898473535687
this is the topic .    2.8539577928066486
ever since the early nineties , the european parliament , the european commission and the european council of ministers have recognised that this coherence of european policy is leaves something to be desired , especially in the field of development cooperation and in other eu policies .    4.732853855234797
this problem has been highlighted on several occasions , to whit in 1992 , in 1995 and 1997 .    3.265004802513225
the examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us .    3.1963832339173854
i have raised questions regarding this issue for years now .    3.5704124035290583
in fact , the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the treaty of amsterdam in 1997 .    3.1726949781238583
but what have we seen since then ?    3.087646178143225
fine words , as is the case again today , but no report . it is too crazy for words , really .    4.895054765127581
it is a fact that we are dealing with contradictory policy . time and time again , good intentions are formulated but nothing is implemented .    2.913083452105671
it is , therefore , with good reason that we bring this up here today .    3.14585916883529
i would like to give you a few examples to illustrate these contradictions .    2.8951822866529286
a number of developing countries grow sugar cane for sugar production .    3.1783150141936707
in the union , sugar is produced from sugar UNK .    3.3886277459072103
in order to prevent this cheap sugar from the developing countries from competing with the more expensive eu sugar , a considerable import levy is imposed on cane sugar .    3.092631153273785
the result is that the export of cane sugar from the relevant countries to the union is significantly restricted .    4.08208073369668
at the same time , we give these countries an enormous amount of development aid .    2.7137690434873734
a minister from one of the caribbean islands which produce sugar cane once told me : if you just allowed our sugar access to the european union , we would not need your development aid at all .    3.9284286118445615
another example is cacao .    3.471543797273997
the european union intends to permit 5 % of alternative UNK in chocolate in order to harmonise the internal market .    3.593469466543011
this could just as well be 0 % - the internal market would still be harmonised .    4.026395883264212
by UNK the percentage level at 5 % , which is now likely to be the case , it is almost certain that hundreds of thousands of small cacao farmers in developing countries will be put at a disadvantage .    4.312965058412628
it seems to be heading this way nevertheless .    3.12757330447465
what are we actually doing then ?    2.7569759769641617
this is also typical of a policy which makes citizens wonder what brussels actually does ?    3.035056123644623
it seems that european industry is more important here than our own principles , our own UNK and the interests of the developing countries .    4.076215760401369
there are also shocking examples in terms of sanctions and embargoes .    3.6863059209152733
why institute an oil boycott against UNK and not against burma , where an elected president is imprisoned , parliament has been sent home and some of the mps have been put in UNK or even murdered ?    3.8331623751364465
here too , mr nielson mentioned another good example regarding the new lomé convention .    3.2049757449042557
if the new lomé convention is simply put into operation , without eradicating all these inconsistencies from the policy , the policy will then be built on shifting sands - to use a UNK expression .    3.677531766041087
the council has quoted examples of inconsistency time after time : in agriculture , commerce , in conflict prevention , in the peace operations , in the fisheries sector , migration and environment .    3.898940820877911
mr nielson , what we are waiting for is a good report on these inconsistencies and a number of specific proposals to eliminate these from the policy .    4.648294264700309
once again , all your fine examples , your marvellous policy - and i include the secretary of state in this - will otherwise be built on shifting sands and will not really come off the ground .    3.5275821484441616
this is also at the request of the citizens .    3.3652643587468467
we have been saying this ourselves since back in 1992 : this is the topic of this debate .    3.546487617434771
i hope the message strikes home and i really hope that you will soon produce a report which contains measures .    3.6315932359970002
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , following the same line as mrs maij - weggen , i believe that we have a number of representatives here who all feel passionate about contributing to this debate .    3.0163399797283046
the topic touches the very core of the european union .    3.1306625862622752
let me begin by specifying precisely what we are debating . article UNK , title UNK of the consolidated treaties of the european union reads as follows : " the community shall take account of the objectives referred to in article 177 in the policies that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries " .    4.092747626038665
what are the objectives which each eu policy needs to take into account ?    3.888105206528821
article 177 specifies these objectives as " sustainable economic and social development of the developing countries , and more particularly the most disadvantaged among them " , the " smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy and the campaign against poverty in the developing countries " .    4.123440652809999
mr president , these are no arbitrary objectives . these are articles , statutory articles , which form part of the european acquis established by law with which the european institutions and member states must comply .    4.256808619995127
every statutory article should , of course , not just be judged on its regularity , but also on the importance of its contents .    4.357577549981275
i am of the opinion - and UNK i am not alone in this - that the principle of policy coherence is essential to every government which aims to be a credible servant of its citizens .    4.444037374982954
this is important if the government wants to gain the trust of society , and also important from the point of view of effectiveness , for coherence is required in order to use the restricted means efficiently .    4.061574751066782
we should not make reality out to be more rose - UNK than it really is .    3.5232693129748442
reality is obstinate .    4.015741665419489
it is up to the government to deal with this fact in a transparent and open manner , without any UNK .    3.8787491736466055
the government is obliged to show up any of its UNK , and to show where , when and why , problems occur with coherence of policy , rather than sweeping it all under the carpet .    3.944828987278432
what we are talking about here today is not an issue which can be UNK with at UNK .    4.404537610138081
poverty in the third world is a harrowing problem that demands urgent attention .    3.658479562826159
it is only natural that we in parliament guard the interests of our citizens , but it is also in the interest of our citizens to live in a stable , international environment , in which the goal of human safety is pursued .    4.71559907040405
this is a moral interest , a safety interest and is , ultimately , even in the interest of our economy .    3.3048346493412177
in whose interest is it really if european taxpayers ' money is used to support economic development in namibia , and if , at the same time , the economic activity of poor cattle farmers in the same country is drastically UNK by rigorous export subsidies , financed by the same tax payers ?    3.623022148354922
we are all acting as if this is not really happening , but we all know that it is .    4.859669954026634
it is not our task as meps to adopt an UNK policy and UNK our heads in the sand .    3.337757944797384
the general interest of policy coherence is , therefore , a responsibility of the commission as a whole , of the council , and of the european parliament .    5.158346170543421
this responsibility cannot only be borne by the commissioner for development and humanitarian aid , however much we like to see him or hear him talk , or by the development council or the parliamentary committee on development and cooperation .    3.7165536495728824
what we need here is an integral approach .    2.9963032026930305
after the UNK and closely reasoned explanation of this approach presented by both mr amado and mr nielson , i would like to note that we are very much looking forward to the proposals , not only by mr nielson , but by the entire commission , in order to make the policy coherent as a whole .    4.525675645433711
this is why we urge the commission , in this sharp and clear resolution , to develop specific instruments .    4.145071518220835
we need to pinpoint , and draw up an inventory of , the problem areas for coherence .    3.582736574919695
we need to make it evident which problems we are solving and which we have not yet solved .    3.8849820705441367
this is why i advocate a monitoring centre for coherence which makes this apparent .    2.7364012307155496
this is why we need to set up inter - service task groups in the commission , in the council and in parliament which can police the UNK of coherence .    4.694384654478778
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , if our neighbour ' s roof is leaking , we can lend him UNK and UNK to collect the water , but it is , of course , more effective to help him plug the leak in the roof .    3.390313595716126
the crisis in last year ' s commission has been solved today , but the commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire parliament will soon demand in the resolution .    4.4665668393756475
i would wish the commissioner all the best in his battle within the commission and wish mr amado the same within the council .    3.4804067924621402
mr president , let us be clear from the outset : when it comes to cooperation , coherence is far from being the UNK .    3.6724094600866817
the treaties provide for the european union to help developing countries to develop but , as the previous speakers have explained so well , there are various distortions to these declarations .    4.720541461207585
the first area of incoherence is the lack of consultation between the union and the member states on individual cooperation policies .    3.8994839523894766
this gives rise to serious UNK , because some community programmes duplicate national programmes , whereas they might have helped other projects about which nothing is done .    3.3176615868137884
and let us not forget that the de facto neo - colonial policy of certain member states does nothing to help the countries which they are supposedly helping to develop .    3.3770198698190033
the second area of incoherence is aid to authoritarian regimes .    2.7950003180779825
we state that good governance and an end to corruption are mandatory but we continue to UNK hundreds of thousands of euros into swiss bank accounts via the UNK of a number of heads of state .    4.047368361713306
we say that we want to protect human rights .    4.682700869673189
we encourage developing countries to respect human rights .    3.704563959342305
we even adopt numerous resolutions condemning every violation of human rights .    2.906421114617978
we ally ourselves with demonstrations and international campaigns .    3.2293764976099673
and yet , at the same time , we allow the arms trade to UNK and do not even attempt to limit the trade in the most atrocious forms of arms such as anti - personnel mines .    3.5883854359341743
nor do we do much to really prevent human rights violations .    2.971251176841378
the fourth area of incoherence in the european union ' s cooperation policy is this : how do you expect to help development by UNK the natural resources of the people you are helping .    4.23462816814373
the european union must leave fish for local fishermen to feed local populations instead of systematically destroying maritime resources through intensive fisheries .    2.764665467854085
we must leave raw materials so that local manufacturers can process them .    2.8551709133540513
i will not even mention oil ; we are all aware of the policy of groups such as elf and total in africa .    3.580259960401491
furthermore , and this will perhaps soon be the fifth area of incoherence , we demand respect for biodiversity , for example so that everyone can produce from their own seeds and preserve the richness of nature ; but at the same time , and this was apparent during recent negotiations , we force acp countries to sign trips agreements .    3.5577619822344984
these agreements risk being extended to living organisms , which would mean the death of biodiversity and the return of de facto UNK for small - scale farmers in the south , at the hands of the multinationals .    3.896922909041532
and yet , and this is the sixth area of incoherence , we do not defend the application of the current treaties .    4.646160427052281
on the one hand , we vote for a budget line for the fight against aids and , on the other hand , we do nothing to ensure compliance with mandatory licences within the framework of the very same trips , despite the fact that this would allow developing countries to produce their own medicines and halt the aids UNK .    3.593587931698198
similarly , during the wto negotiations , at a time when , to quote the second paragraph of the UNK report , " the current trade liberalisation process has not yet brought significant benefits for large parts of the population of developing countries , especially the poor " , the european union continues to defend the liberalisation of trade and intends to put an end to the system of favouring acp countries , albeit with a transitional period of several years , instead of strengthening it , especially for the poorest countries .    4.112257118526688
the eighth area of incoherence is of a political and practical nature .    4.158031587858416
we are always saying think globally , act locally .    2.9339297168353817
and yet we disregard local development agencies and prefer to negotiate with national governments and subsidise northern ngos at the expense of local programmes and southern ngos .    2.878642942105526
and what about agriculture and the environment ? still more problems , still more areas of incoherence which i might have highlighted , not to mention research , UNK or health .    3.6924572151850206
i say it again , the european union ' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent . and on behalf of the green group i call on parliament , the institutions and the commission to make a joint effort , at long last , to put some coherence into our policy .    4.667035090269749
mr president , i feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate , not just because development is in general an important issue , but because it is also a topical one .    4.271527269730548
seattle was a failure , and north - south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons .    3.6736206740599595
the meeting held in that north american city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries .    2.855205429440255
the UNK united nations conference on trade and development is being held right now in UNK , and is suffering the consequences of that failure .    4.122175804124895
in the meantime , however , as has already been mentioned , the negotiations on the future of the lomé convention have been concluded .    4.053515597790412
this goes to show just how topical this subject is .    3.0207540614560044
we could also add to the list the next eu - oau summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in UNK in april .    3.8450750607158746
however , i would also like to add that any analysis , no matter how superficial , inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north - south relations , including those between the european union and the less developed countries .    3.5815585007766444
you only have to realise that the category of " least developed countries " has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years , and now represents 13 % of the world ' s population , yet this category only accounts for 0 . 4 % of world exports and 0 . 6 % of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23 % since 1990 .    3.1628157689673775
michel UNK , a fair man who is still director of the international monetary fund , said in his speech at the opening of the UNK conference , and i am now quoting , that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other . he was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries .    4.443927408021939
it may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position , but he did indeed say this , and i heard it with my own ears .    4.135168809388419
this comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation , and i accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north - south relations and break the mould .    3.9904104492222685
in particular , we need to reconsider the role of the european union in this area , as i am certain that one of the union ' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order . it is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation , bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based , and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries , particularly in this context .    4.584440689311454
a new agreement has been reached with the acp countries .    3.0665750846447017
this is a positive development in itself , especially given the pressures to UNK it and the fact that various member states did not wish it to continue .    3.887142403052575
we will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth , but meanwhile there is no doubt that the european negotiators were more UNK and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time , even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points .    3.968502766466286
certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these .    4.056339900636596
this was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions , and this is certainly true of the european union , especially in the field of good governance and trade .    4.210738070957715
but it was above all the result of a stronger acp group , which obviously found new courage following the events in seattle .    3.560465452906286
lastly , we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries .    3.14615755752194
i have in mind budgetary and financing aspects , indebtedness , assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety , humanitarian , educational and health - related issues , and also fields such as the environment , investment and access to information and new technologies . this also applies to the sphere of trade , where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other community policies , and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the member states .    3.748408132695944
we cannot simply UNK ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong - headed .    3.627226746556858
mr president , having listened to the council and the commission today , i just had to look at my agenda .    4.028562371496572
yes , it does say : ' coherence of different union policies with development policy ' .    3.1142776797235143
but we have not heard a single word on this subject , and i find that deeply embarrassing .    4.181533968342927
we have been waiting for a report on coherence for years .    3.4540044194496584
it ought to have been here in writing today and , after having heard mr nielson ' s speech , i can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the commission .    4.304224978953176
i know that the commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence , and these are what i should like to have heard expressed here today .    3.612991404231653
because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence , i shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism , namely obliging the commission to carry out an evaluation of new , relevant legislation from this aspect .    3.77776289122593
i also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the eu ' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries : dumping of beef in UNK and south africa , UNK UNK in west africa and milk powder in jamaica .    3.676636709159948
the examples are , i hope , all well known . in any case , they are known all too well to the producers in the acp countries who are affected by these measures and who have to destroy their products because they cannot compete with eu - subsidised products .    3.8930280532207893
european taxpayers contribute eur 40 billion per year in support of agriculture in the eu .    2.983959728187089
this is money which is helping to impede the development of the agricultural sector in the developing countries , which accounts for 69 % of the total work force there compared with 1 . 7 % in the eu .    3.355983538563952
add to this the fact that the agricultural sector accounts for 34 % of the developing countries ' gross national product , compared with 5 . 3 % in the eu .    3.6122866650547127
there is neither coherence nor human UNK here .    3.0652326242524457
why will neither the council nor the commission admit the fact ?    3.314566609557552
mr president , how policy decisions are arrived at is surely fundamental .    2.7616195344156123
the prime minister of the united kingdom and his foreign secretary yesterday made statements on their policy in regard to the voting system within the council .    3.7900675195497535
they pointed out that the uk , france and germany far exceed the other countries of the european union at present in terms of population .    4.802344221120459
they then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the united kingdom would not surrender its veto .    3.9748642727091803
is the council discussing this issue ?    3.246789118881184
is it prepared to maintain a democratic veto based on population strengths or is it still moving towards a simple majority vote of council members , rather than a vote reflecting the population in europe which they democratically represent ?    3.4348095141509987
have the uk representatives indicated to the council their decision and proposal and what , if any , consideration has been given to it ?    3.703677446787625
as this voting matter is vital to the democratic future of this union , surely it should receive priority consideration .    3.606412815312463
how decisions are made is all - important .    3.629394697782808
co - president of the acp - eu joint assembly . mr president , i thank the council and the commission for their statements this morning , but i will concentrate on coherence policy because that is what the agenda says we are talking about .    4.209093367636654
much as i agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different union policies and development policy , i question whether today is the time to be holding it .    3.9913806355663084
however , the council statement gave me hope for the future .    3.0956020224715064
it is quite obvious to me , as someone who UNK in development policy , that there are many areas where lack of coherence is dramatically affecting developing nations .    3.8303961397272537
i will give some examples shortly .    2.9920631885334172
this was followed by a request from the council to the commission to provide an annual report , the first of which was to be discussed in 1998 .    4.486658488927249
we still await the first report , and that is why i believe this debate was premature , as the commission had little to say on coherence this morning .    4.708693836330227
the areas identified by the council are specific areas where policy coherence is particularly important , such as peace - building , conflict prevention and resolution , food security , fisheries and immigration .    3.928699839575341
some of these issues have been discussed in depth .    3.6134648174621584
i personally feel that issues such as peace - building and conflict prevention and resolution are very much the domain of african heads of state , with capacity support from the european union and the oau acting as arbiter .    3.6678968233155413
the issues that are really affected by lack of coherence are in areas such agriculture , trade , environment and biodiversity , but UNK lies the real problem : these are the highly sensitive areas of policy within the european union as a whole and in this parliament in particular .    4.1426725799909425
members of this house will have differing views , even within the same political parties , depending on ( a ) which country they come from or ( b ) which committee they sit on .    3.459270899861104
there are areas of coherence i would like to see as a member of the committee on development that would probably UNK some of the members of the committee on agriculture or committee on fisheries .    4.086180565434934
as a lack of coherence , one can cite as mrs UNK did , the UNK of milk products to jamaica at prices far below production costs there which has almost ruined the UNK UNK industry .    3.590947542972914
we have beef exported to southern africa , to namibia and south africa , which then sell their indigenous beef to swaziland , so that swaziland can fill its export quota back to the european union .    2.9593393077315615
remember too , some countries blocked an agreement with south african trade for four years .    3.4006101063598932
if we simply import raw materials from these developing countries , rather than allowing them the add - on value of producing their finished articles in their own country , we deny them the very poverty - eradication that we have set as our top principle in helping developing nations .    3.567906472459854
i am not surprised the commission is having trouble producing a basic document for discussion on sustainable and social development .    3.6721150925888133
there is a natural resistance in the developing world to anything that would lower standards of living and create further unemployment .    3.403655685966153
i wish the commission well in its task of producing that basic document .    3.079384416822828
mr president , this morning ' s debate is very important .    3.141098098396
i therefore thank the commission and the council for having made a statement on the coherence of community policies in relation to development , because this demonstrates a will to make policy in this area more effective .    4.671651546695601
however , if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the UNK in our policy , we will end up totally frustrated and , furthermore , the result will be negative .    4.309489188680593
as with the systems of forces which are studied in basic UNK , it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out .    3.249686269803548
the result of this absurd game is not zero , but rather a minus number , as a consequence of the material , financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise .    3.462684116774666
with regard to policy , this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure UNK out the intended effect of another .    3.504563512749428
in today ' s globalised world , this fact is all the more obvious .    3.5601747716290686
there are no boundaries for community policies .    3.1579706442235493
i am therefore glad that the commission and the council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of community policies , and that , together with complementarity between national and community policies and coordination between the services of the commission , they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the european union .    4.209919773804913
both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied .    4.010597443352684
for example , the commission , in its long term guidelines , says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity , supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account .    3.6517730422904173
the commission is addressing a very important area , that is , commercial policy .    3.9343242755160963
however , this parliament wishes to add policies to aid development , agriculture , fisheries policy , immigration , our position in international financial institutions , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform .    3.219190753936356
the council - and mr luis amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time , it is true , being in november 1999 , and also on other occasions , such as the development councils of may 1999 and june 1997 - but with no concrete results .    3.88513922140246
since the development council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say , as some previous speakers have pointed out .    4.560717012320267
however , as parliament , we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter - service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different community policies , which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves .    4.290183437857439
what we really want , however , is to be UNK and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination , complementarity and , the most complex one , which we are discussing at the moment , coherence , will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the european union .    4.6423266884998045
we therefore hope that the commission , in the report it is going to present to us on global policy , will also address the question of coherence as an integral element in the efficient use of community resources and the specific management of public interests .    4.724559479333872
but we who sit here in parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is .    3.7061117042084426
i should therefore like to discuss something more general and begin with a couple of , in my view , useful figures .    3.5823507532103878
at the beginning of the nineteenth century , real per capita income in the world ' s richest countries was three times higher than in the poorest countries . in UNK it was ten times higher and in the year 2000 it is 60 times higher .    3.5112891823265437
and there is no sign of this trend ' s being reversed .    3.489762603025611
on the contrary , it looks as if we have entered an exponential curve which is widening the gap still further . this is shown by the following figures : the income gap between the richest and poorest fifths was 30 : 1 in UNK , 60 : 1 in 1990 and 74 : 1 in 1997 .    3.186949889968706
these figures are from before the internet revolution took off .    3.2691613469721714
in other words , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries , including the eu countries , are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale .    3.75327825218964
in a global village , major discrepancies in the world will not , in the longer term , be tolerated by the poorest section of the village .    3.8374459916214394
at some time or another , there will be a UNK , and it will be fully justified .    5.236725830188959
i would therefore urge the council ' s presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , including the people of europe , realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide .    4.203233286830687
the eu on average is far from providing the pledged 0 . 7 % .    3.0637731003806996
it may well be that others are worse , but that does not place us in any better a light .    3.4887736693420743
above all , however , we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us .    5.160703452396275
as far as i could hear - but i may have missed something - the president - in - office of the council did not mention the word " trade " at all .    2.9189297182913707
i would just say to the commissioner that i hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the commission and the member states . i would also ask the commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up , not only in the commission but also in the member states .    4.074756911660823
i should also like to say that , in my view , what would be most effective would be for parliament to call for proposals from , respectively , the development council and the commissioner for development . in that way , we should perhaps have a basis for discussion , instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the commission , which is scarcely likely to produce results .    4.416593677348129
i shall conclude with a few words about the internet revolution .    3.2293846548987375
as commissioner liikanen keeps saying on his UNK , we have a head start here in europe in the area of mobile telecommunications .    4.6797919005744975
let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries .    4.371877421273911
this technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which i referred and , in this connection , the eu can set the agenda , leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities .    4.123835890565784
mr president , " the eu ' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired " .    3.3462081904553034
this is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week , commenting on the union ' s development policy .    2.9429998068951133
this is not new .    2.876317496986073
ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation , its effectiveness and quality have been called into question .    3.243580109968797
hope of improvement threatens to be UNK in the UNK if the commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror .    4.8750745310895995
why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally ?    3.780323442962657
one of the major conclusions of this report concerned the european policy ' s internal conflict .    4.023136480472492
in terms of trade and agriculture , in particular , the european policy is in conflict with the development policy .    4.868875010284386
we seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries .    4.278182817004571
this has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the union regarding development cooperation .    3.664823368156903
we should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations , but as a policy in its own right .    3.888563580266198
i advocate transparent , joint and efficient development policy .    3.182374333285907
as long as the european approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and UNK more money , it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the member states .    3.3380596785857137
finally , i would like to ask the commission to send the document i referred to to the european parliament as soon as possible , so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way .    3.778253478918087
mr president , commissioner , i believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense .    3.365423537293109
as various members have already commented , we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies , whose objectives run counter to development in those countries .    3.7012425257935457
and we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies , tourism , the environment , agriculture , fisheries and industry .    4.043023927316792
we are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies .    3.828637252575522
so there is a whole raft of contradictions .    3.43043432700483
in my opinion , these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of community policies . they are , if anything , more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some member states .    3.7623550974445172
we have to be aware of this .    3.1086769509617396
we often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world , as was recently the case with indonesia , when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some european countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment .    3.5329995549378057
for me , these are the most serious contradictions in all this , more serious than the contradictions inherent in any UNK between sectoral policies .    3.961399748243513
we obviously know that , even within any one country , there are always contradictions between various policies .    4.243783799878316
that is a fact of life .    3.4211451625009683
and we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various community policies , in this case development policy .    4.877518605999716
we have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them . the underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one .    4.101261264410048
i believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between community policies and development and cooperation policy , and that this monitoring centre ' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to community policies , but should also cover member states ' actions and policies , including the actions of economic groups , which i think are also important .    4.263873040536268
i have left to the end a question that i regard as fundamental and which i think needs to be noted and approved by this house .    4.294859495018006
our objective of minimising contradictions between development and cooperation policy and other policies has to be a valid objective , not merely within the european union , but also at world level , given the increasing globalisation of the economy .    4.160530507602569
if we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next wto round of multilateral negotiations , because it would be contradictory if the european union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself , only for the united states and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint .    4.291580091192296
that is why i consider it to be essential - and fair - for these principles to be established at the next wto round .    3.546525578556931
mr president , the director - general of the dg for development has said that to produce a report on coherence of eu policies with development policies , before this spring ' s paper on development policy itself , is like putting the cart before the horse .    3.197469869051303
never mind that the commission ' s requirement to produce an annual report , set out clearly in the council resolution , has produced only one " non - paper " , the real problem here is that at the time of rising world poverty this particular horse is UNK UNK and the cart of other eu policies is so heavy that development policy is actually being pulled slowly backwards .    4.066369754397135
time after time development policy is forgotten or is an UNK when the major policies of this european union are considered .    4.423912571698289
take the new chocolate directive , which shows that eu countries spend more on chocolate every year than on development aid .    3.2090074274474607
there has been no proper development assessment of this directive which the producer countries , 90 % of which are our acp partners , estimate could cut incomes to cacao farmers by at least 15 % .    3.3151536560503456
take the fishing agreements , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the eu waters .    3.591481106264114
take the trade agreements .    3.264987023685316
as mr nielson said this morning with regard to lomé , preferential access is only for " essentially all the products of the least - developed countries " .    3.360167020217431
in other words , when eu commercial interests are concerned , poverty considerations go out of the window .    3.3388323995513134
in the stance that we took at seattle , why such a silence on the eu ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the gatt , including for the crucial UNK sector ?    3.2555218525520044
on the common agricultural policy , the biggest UNK - no development impact assessment of the agenda 2000 cap reforms .    3.989142353123688
everyone now knows of the scandal of the export UNK scheme which dumped 54 000 tonnes of excess subsidised beef on west african markets , UNK prices for local cattle farmers by half .    2.7721498936827507
today beef stocks stand at 300 000 tonnes .    3.2056650627655343
who will be next , quite literally , for the UNK ?    4.2365913787403375
i welcome mr UNK ' statement this morning , which acknowledged the difficulties of non - UNK of the edf , which called for a more active role for the development council and which called for development priorities to be central to the eu ' s emerging common foreign and security policy .    3.669460035631508
i welcome too the council declaration of 1992 , its resolution of 1997 and successive changes in the treaty of european union .    3.962617213811341
that is why we want annual reports , we want an annual inter - service group and we want a complaints procedure , to make sure action is actually taken .    3.985497561189311
mr president , i would like to restrict my contribution to the link between development cooperation and agriculture .    3.1704663115109146
over the past couple of years , a considerable share of the funds has been channelled towards the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in the developing countries and , more especially , the lomé countries .    3.695413601422737
the results are certainly not what we expected .    3.67477329200282
i think that the cause should first and foremost be sought in the lack of clear agricultural policy in the various developing countries , UNK a few exceptions .    4.470107342460913
i think that the commission could do a great deal there to help this develop .    3.7596511700659687
no farmer , anywhere in the world , will produce something if prices are too low .    3.4591847152713906
the governments in the developing countries are always faced with a difficult dilemma : whom should they support , the farmers or the people in the large cities who want cheap food ?    3.478201211218346
this fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the commission , and not by the commission on its own . in most countries where the commission is active , development aid is also granted by the member states themselves .    4.911970045126994
it should not be the case that the policy of the member states contravenes that of the commission .    3.8292606696931446
it is up to the commission ' s delegations in the developing countries to assume a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and to ensure that all countries follow this line of approach .    3.9714127884784736
special attention is also required for the costs of the means of production .    3.9468193769194486
far too often , artificial UNK , veterinary UNK and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge .    3.1979731612768427
once the project comes to an end after five years , the policy of free UNK also ends .    4.164878966334564
finally , i wonder whether the funds could not be put to better use .    3.7563097170588087
every year , i notice in the budget of the commission and in the european development fund , that they are far behind in spending the funds .    4.516039323374143
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , we are in actual fact holding a debate amongst the converted , which is a pity .    3.0660032287810375
we also note that , as before , there are still various dgs which stifle this policy with often very conflicting procedures and arguments .    3.7727522941633667
the president - in - office of the council came up with a good suggestion , namely to budget the european development fund .    3.1646638401195704
parliament would , of course , welcome this with open arms . if this were possible , it would be a huge , historic victory .    4.043748136194091
since amsterdam , three terms have taken centre stage : complementarity , coordination and cohesion .    3.133164802515664
i believe that very little has been achieved in these three fields .    3.250398200636097
if a request is made for a report on the progress made on cohesion , if a request is made at all , then drafting such a report cannot be very difficult , unless one simply UNK that there is no cohesion at all .    3.844282919443015
i would prefer it if a report were to be written on the present lack of cohesion , and if a systematic strategy were to be developed to reach a certain level of cohesion , for it is a long way off yet .    4.344061475488651
one thing shocked me in the speech of the president - in - office of the council .    2.61195912831126
he stated : " contradictions in policy can lead to balance . "    3.3978372492894997
it is indeed the case that what one hand gives can be taken away by the other hand , and vice versa .    3.3019399380419148
but this leads to status - quo and self - UNK , and globalisation as a whole has so far only led to changes , indeed , but changes which have only made poverty worse .    3.700227910043136
this is supposed to be our priority , would you believe .    3.7933162713322153
i know that we do a great deal of good , but let us start with this very essential aspect .    3.8453063620163146
mr president , we have already noted that there is no report from the commission , but i intend to discuss three matters in the light of the objectives which the council presented in its 1997 opinion .    4.551919131864316
the first is concerned with conflict resolution .    2.7574872731161326
for many years , i have tried , through the council and the commission , to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in , and working for , conflict resolution in the western UNK , which is occupied by morocco .    4.834908700043991
we ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial UNK in africa to an end .    3.155235480681967
i also want to take up the subject of migration .    3.3956630484082786
i am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the acp countries , which might make it easier to expel immigrants , asylum seekers and refugees on UNK grounds .    3.4730101848532002
i really also want to see the eu UNK patents on living organisms .    3.563911177505263
we now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds .    3.6516524096324425
three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age .    3.4396723972406322
this is not because of a lack of food , but because of what we have talked a lot about today , namely increasing poverty .    3.8041283871233715
food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests .    3.286613850436853
i believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply , specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason .    2.838743953264943
i also want to see something about women in the report i hope the commission will produce .    4.356505697184077
women appear to be completely absent from all areas , especially development policy when , of course , we are not in reality absent at all .    3.7096235737396612
mr president , the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid .    3.021411640719355
the level of aid is naturally important , and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased .    4.744483566372019
this ought to be done with , in particular , a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity .    4.754088620457841
however , the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries .    3.297351973893647
a number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed .    3.6040018580794113
the latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies .    3.0981740927090082
other important areas are , of course , the flow of private investments , cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with , and finances solutions to , a variety of global problems which affect us all .    3.562548610493
these problems include questions of climate , health issues , biodiversity etc , and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation , that is to say the new economy which is developing .    3.802604009150619
in this economy , the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked .    3.339501483392943
in my opinion , what we are discussing here today is partly the eu ' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance .    4.080003906077375
the report , or survey , which mrs maij - weggen has demanded , showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be , is naturally quite crucial .    3.397456476042458
i cannot help but wonder why the commission has not done more .    3.5991598954653923
the commission is new and has to be given time , but the absence of such a survey suggests that there are powerful tensions within the commission .    4.800057628157109
i can only hope that mr UNK will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the commission .    3.646603610660822
in addition to a report of this kind , i should like to see a more positive analysis which could be ongoing in character .    3.840049237147471
an analysis of this kind should look not only at the flow of aid but also give comprehensive consideration to all the different types of aid and transfers of resources which influence poor countries . these include technology , trade , cooperation in the field of research etc .    3.8818328931347215
it should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting .    4.092244350328172
finally , parliament recommends , in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution , that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence .    4.2679482709649275
i believe it is only a coincidence , but the commissioner for the environment is also , of course , to participate in this group .    4.576909265564397
let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed .    5.1020943383158555
policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other .    3.7386262895070783
mr president , the seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less - and least - developed countries , it is purely a rich country UNK interest .    3.2476710963923927
yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as india and tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent .    3.205317163111103
there the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs , allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain .    3.0427425880987657
it did not work ; poverty became worse than ever .    3.160526622875655
the medicine may not taste too good in the short term , but opening one ' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term .    3.435225264782338
is that not the lesson of the european union itself and of the single market in particular ?    4.90896334600124
as mr nielson said , this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity .    3.691871761296741
yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough .    3.8930319892497938
we also have to practise what we preach in our own UNK for imports from these countries . parliament ' s resolution on the wto negotiations advocated a free import policy by the eu .    3.63246747296814
it is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy UNK our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for europe and our fine words .    3.315065734382135
mr president , in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence , coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the community and of the member states .    4.267564452380336
there is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public UNK which would be a litmus test of the union ' s ability to match words with action .    3.506150765568272
i am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti - personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes , to post - conflict reconstruction , and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world , particularly in developing countries .    3.8986644349865704
over recent years the community has spent some eur 200 million in mine UNK , assistance to victims and related activities .    3.106298396294983
the member states have spent similar amounts .    3.6446001621754247
but there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti - personnel landmine problem within a UNK time span .    4.021698684225151
mr nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with member states .    3.6367371254479757
this has been talked about for years .    2.849248305696469
the commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes , strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions , ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell .    3.250778972531218
it would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes .    3.0641133010306554
a proper stock - taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines .    3.555819869451968
it seems to me that the landmine issue UNK so many of the organisational , procedural , financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the commission and the union .    3.3955684896800196
mr president , commissioner nielson , the conclusion of the new acp - eu convention is an important step towards greater coherence .    3.8652811682545263
and it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights , democracy , rule of law , and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously , and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent , rather , we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect .    3.7465909063324423
for these are prerequisite to any development .    3.332347037901705
if these criteria are not adhered to , then development does not stand a chance    3.233452591230001
the same goes for cuba , mr UNK .    2.9300054344439155
i welcome the fact that cuba is getting closer to joining this process . but for this to happen , there are also going to have to be a few changes in cuba .    4.281773278966692
after all , we are all familiar with the reports from amnesty international .    3.1370797087774744
there is a second issue i would like to raise .    3.5940510707355906
we are discussing coherence here .    3.309337255086893
many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent .    3.5835219858641323
in my view , however , the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too .    4.8426077376058085
there is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the member states and there are some projects being carried out by the member states and the european union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another .    4.580194340579144
nor is there coherence vis - à - vis the european taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the union ' s budget but the edf remains outside it .    3.1090302924951065
mr president - in - office of the council , if in future you succeed in making this eur 13 . 5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary committee on budgetary control , and to bodies such as olaf , then i believe you will raise the level of acceptability .    3.2303152432907924
this , to my mind , is also something that we should call upon the intergovernmental conference to do , i . e . establish the edf firmly in the budget of the european union .    4.045069846801125
mr president , we certainly must concede that , on balance , this text is full of good intentions , but we did not vote in favour of it in committee , nor shall we do so in plenary . we had two reasons for this , both of which gave rise to amendments which i should like to explain here very briefly .    4.229750277028337
in our view , cooperation is , and should remain , an intergovernmental exercise .    3.608885863463687
with europe preparing to enlarge , UNK the edf would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the community budget , quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy .    3.708023056088295
lastly , the commission has , in the recent past , had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid UNK , as mrs maes has just reminded us so opportunely .    4.025148621052339
why should we add to them ?    3.224100387473698
secondly , we find it most regrettable that mr corrie ' s report should mention the trade and development agreement with south africa because , in the final analysis , this report is typical of the amateur diplomacy to which the european commission is taking ever more frequent recourse .    3.613833791495967
it is perfectly UNK that the union could have negotiated an agreement on behalf of the member states in which a fundamental section is quite simply left blank .    4.542025869505899
as a result , we are now in the absurd position of negotiating from a position of weakness on vital aspects such as wine and agricultural production within the framework of an agreement which we have already signed .    3.9068921150883704
the part of this agreement which blocks negotiations could mean that the union ends up paying producers to stop producing UNK , port and a whole host of products which are purely and simply copies under international commercial law . imagine the potential cost of such a precedent .    3.641800467583476
it is proof , as if we still needed it , of the fact that UNK diplomacy , which defends no interests , unless of course they are individual interests , and is caught between the dogma of free trade and pressure groups and more or less friendly ngos , is not just inefficient , it is positively dangerous .    4.268077085726585
finally , a word on the general thinking behind the corrie report .    2.8713386856069065
it was a chance to reiterate that our original and exemplary mode of cooperation with the southern countries should be developed and strengthened .    3.524161584954221
the corrie report missed this chance and we must , regrettably , punish it for losing so much .    3.5598161777243407
. ( pt ) mr president , by way of both a conclusion and a summary , i would like to highlight three key aspects of this debate .    3.5457829986337877
first of all , many speakers stressed that globalisation accentuates regional imbalances and social inequality , and increases poverty .    2.8725429694976903
this suggests that something must be done , failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or UNK .    3.140341246909496
secondly , it will be important to approach development policies from a different angle in this context , taking advantage of their capacity for correcting imbalances and reducing inequality .    3.5765364635676433
i believe that the importance that everyone has attached to the european union ' s role in international development policies is significant .    3.439423656262651
everyone recognises , indeed this was the theme of today ' s debate , that , if the european union is to play a more active and leading role in development policies at world level , it will have no choice but to enhance the coherence of its own various development - related policies . i note that some speakers also emphasised that responsibility for coherence in eu policies is not a matter for the council , for the commission or for parliament alone .    4.5695759669281575
quite the contrary - it will have to be the subject of a concerted effort in terms of discussion and legislative and institutional preparation , be it on the part of the commission or of the council , or even on the part of the european parliament itself , and some members have in fact already suggested that a monitoring centre or a working party could be established to monitor the impact of various policies in the specific area of development .    4.5382290511238095
finally , i would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the portuguese presidency ' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the european union ' s policies , and in particular in the context of its foreign policy .    4.37986760487773
we believe that this is absolutely vital , failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies , and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning europe ' s status in the international system .    4.209126104828006
for this reason it may be necessary , as i have stressed , to change the model and move away from the post - colonial model towards a more european approach to development policies .    3.971528831504995
in this respect i believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention , which succeeds the lomé convention , is an important instrument of renewal , and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process , as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in seattle .    3.770222841842451
. i sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate .    3.9327883003886934
i have given you a statement on behalf of the commission which i think provides a useful background to this discussion .    3.769414964017242
we will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence .    3.445648155152627
this discussion is not new .    3.4327834553606804
we are currently working on it in the commission and when that work is done i will report on it , as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence .    5.013015272331655
i have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the commission and the dg on development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda .    4.006765611421407
this also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the commission system which may very well include , as suggested by some of the political groups in parliament , the setting up of a special intra - service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the commission .    3.994492529206293
i have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything .    3.4021664290793754
i think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist , and we certainly do have them .    3.4452018514485183
much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every member state , as has been very honestly said here in this house : people more or less identify with their spheres of interest , and all this is legitimate .    4.243190347578053
i would , however , warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical UNK in the system .    3.6077847872157087
this exists , but it is only a small part of what we are discussing .    4.1734755600498845
the major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on , and this is the problem .    4.003614209659587
mr mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low .    3.2869341562963545
this is true in our part of the world , but our partners and beneficiaries in africa have a slightly different perspective .    3.4016521488756775
subsistence farming is not based on price calculations , it is based on the hope of rain in the next season .    4.438346108367828
this does not apply to all farming in developing countries but to the poverty - focusing which we need to deliver better than so far .    3.8847033212344613
from that perspective , what i am saying here is of deep relevance .    3.4860266924451566
other issues have been mentioned : cattle - farming in namibia , UNK and milk powder in the caribbean .    3.650067692365423
we should not be too masochistic .    3.2758603178352335
there is a limit to how useful that is .    3.281328319944634
all these cases are characterised by the fact that they have been taken care of .    4.053787211026
the intervention prices have been regulated , and the problems we had with beef in western africa and in namibia were actually solved by reducing the intervention support .    3.6530066105901207
these are real problems , but they have all been dealt with .    3.526662547872591
as regards the issue of cacao , chocolate : i repeat that the 5 % has to do with creating a basis for a living in the neighbouring countries .    3.6654352579022986
what we are talking about here are the local nuts which are as important to the people collecting them and making a living out of them in UNK UNK as UNK for farmers in UNK .    3.8521232098746
this is not a clear case of incoherence , it is more a case of a competition between suppliers .    4.235904449544969
what was mentioned concerning sugar in the caribbean is more complicated .    3.4403568322688014
in the overseas countries and territories framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem , but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some european companies than with generating income in the caribbean . in any case , this is a matter which we are currently dealing with .    4.203711764393866
i am committed to try to create a balance in all these issues and i would mention the achievement of the trade development and cooperation agreement with south africa .    4.400016080996304
in all modesty , i would claim that this is something that documents that the commission is willing to walk or fly the extra UNK in order to ensure coherence between the perspective of development cooperation and the perspective of trade interests .    4.5254804943814495
we certainly have done our share to solve that problem , and i sincerely hope that we now will have a soft landing and a peaceful implementation in the forthcoming years of that agreement .    4.0944254421905555
finally , i thank you again for this debate .    3.4483015010907554
we will come back again with material on these issues , because these problems , in one way or another , are here to stay , simply because development cooperation represents basically doing something in the world that is different from taking care of traditionally - defined trade interests , etc . we have to reconcile those different approaches .    3.8885332902496064
thank you very much , commissioner nielson .    2.391508327392338
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place on thursday at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.623621155697488
next session of un human rights commission    3.2647234411053523
the next item is the statement by the council on eu priorities for the next session of the un human rights commission on 20 march 2000 .    2.937661517258908
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , the european union played an active role in the 55th session of the human rights commission held in geneva in march and april 1999 .    2.637159637288035
it tabled resolutions on the human rights situation in iran , iraq , in the israeli settlements , in burma / myanmar , in the democratic republic of the congo and in sudan , and negotiated statements to be issued on behalf of the chairman on colombia and on east timor .    3.4893416596466427
for the first time , the european union tabled a resolution on the death penalty , which was enormously successful , and led work on a resolution concerning children ' s rights , which was a joint initiative with the latin american group of countries .    3.920126379751864
the union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the human rights commission to be held in geneva in march and april .    3.246740885377042
in particular , as agreed at the human rights council group on 9 february 2000 , the european union intends to table draft resolutions on the israeli settlements , iran , iraq , sudan , the democratic republic of the congo , burma / myanmar , a draft chairman ' s statement on colombia , and , possibly , on east timor , together with a draft statement on the situation in various countries .    3.5396209198267794
the european union will continue discussions on preparations for the 56th session of the human rights commission at the next meeting of the human rights group in march .    3.3701129611271514
in particular , there will be a discussion of the possibility of tabling a draft resolution on the death penalty .    3.4086563121825617
to date , the group has not reached agreement on the strategy to be adopted in this respect , and in particular with regard to formulating a compromise to be tabled in the last resort in case of any amendments to the contrary , including article 2 ( 7 ) of the charter of the united nations , which refers to sovereignty .    4.5525451502705145
we have tried to reach agreement in advance on a compromise text , in view of the difficulties that arose at the 1999 session of the third committee of the united nations general assembly , at which the member states failed to agree on an amendment introducing a reference to article 2 ( 7 ) into the draft resolution sponsored by the european union on the death penalty .    4.090440373047411
as you know , at the 55th session of the human rights commission held last year , the united states decided , at a very late stage , to table a draft resolution on china .    3.713408987960697
this draft resolution was defeated by a chinese no - action motion .    2.7708292216291355
the european union voted against that motion .    3.4443702896407844
the european union ' s position on the approach to be adopted towards china in the human rights commission was confirmed at the general affairs council on 21 march 1999 : there was no european union initiative on china nor was agreement reached to co - sponsor a resolution on china , but an eu vote against the no - action motion .    3.189286785463454
it is by no means certain that the european union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote .    3.6308853839112154
the united states of america will be tabling a draft resolution on china at the 56th session of the human rights commission and are putting pressure on the european union to support this draft resolution .    3.385000519345724
this initiative has provoked a strong reaction on china ' s part : the chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the european union , in an attempt to persuade them not to support the united states ' initiative .    4.023322444302477
this initiative is being discussed within the union , but with no hope of a decision in the near future .    4.070628255969638
it is in the interests of the european union to keep all its options open for as long as possible , and in any case at least until after the eu - china human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 february 2000 .    3.9094398941122823
in view of changes made to the membership of the human rights commission , we estimate the vote on the no - action motion will be close .    3.4179008485368327
in this context it is important to note that the european union regularly opposes requests by china that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the human rights commission in geneva .    3.877335063400085
the european union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party , the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground , and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the human rights commission , potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing .    4.336825529248557
the european union also regularly informs china that the human rights commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues , and whether or not it agrees with this initiative , this is in any case legitimate from this point of view .    3.9768804255920958
the next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 february in lisbon , and will include seminars on legal issues and on women ' s rights , and it is expected that representatives from the UNK world and from civil society will take part .    3.900878745870733
the next human rights seminar will be organised by the portuguese presidency in may 2000 , and , during the last round of the dialogue in october 1999 , the chinese side accepted the european union ' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the united nations international pact on economic , social and cultural rights and the united nations ' international pact on civil and political rights , both of which have been signed by the chinese government .    4.302429415738371
the european union is discussing issues on which it hopes that china will take concrete measures , and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the chinese authorities the message that the european union hopes china will announce positive measures at the session on 25 february .    3.7862461508160106
the presidency will also present to the chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern .    3.7709068040186557
the meeting held in beijing in october 1999 confirmed that , on the one hand , the chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself , with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention . on the other hand , they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity .    3.965638039228243
discussions within the european union about the situation in china following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the european union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in china more firmly ; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue , while recognising the positive steps that china has made on the international stage .    4.23370144944351
on various occasions the european union has reiterated to the chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue , and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas .    3.9412555937170226
it was decided that the dialogue should continue , but in a more targeted and effective way , given that china has agreed with the european union ' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars .    4.230026117656328
lastly , during the next human rights commission there will also be a debate on UNK the work of the commission itself .    4.913188329165905
a working party has been set up with the express task of UNK the commission ' s mechanisms . this working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous , especially in the financial field .    4.839116330541883
the european union will oppose any UNK attempt to use this reform of the human rights commission ' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level .    3.6292417912418444
. mr president , i would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for geneva on subjects like racism , civil and political rights and the right to development .    3.524166269874916
as the presidency said , much remains to be done , despite the understandable request by parliament and many ngos that the european union should set out its position well in advance of the geneva session .    3.6580437305669316
that is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the UNK issues .    4.561575919578109
for example , discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in parliament ' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases .    4.531769650686013
it is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult .    4.126128600313874
that does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference .    3.9085905186192136
however , let me reflect that concern by referring to three controversial issues : the death penalty , cuba and china .    3.3092279095126567
i am going to be so unwise as to allow one or two personal UNK to UNK into my remarks .    3.9866461540642946
we are currently reviewing the options and possibilities for introducing a death penalty resolution in the human rights commission .    2.997326328135673
this has always been a subject about which i personally have felt extremely strongly , i have always voted against the death penalty .    3.599619568171573
UNK on by amnesty international and others , one of the first decisions i took as governor of hong kong was to abolish the death penalty .    3.3168412277522337
we know what happened recently at the un general assembly .    3.265173189679643
we had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or risk the passing of a resolution that would have incorporated wholly unacceptable arguments that asserted that human rights are not universally applicable and valid .    3.242084706315933
the new york stage is different from geneva .    3.2241927463761826
last year ' s debate in new york on sovereignty and humanitarian intervention was such a sensitive topic that it influenced all other issues .    3.295932767987899
it certainly influenced the debate on the moratorium on the death penalty .    3.2389076374497314
the debate in geneva , however , is more focused on human rights issues .    4.344957151564435
we may therefore stand a better chance of making progress there .    3.1302720795856933
secondly , cuba .    3.3029821243697675
i want to address this issue directly because we in europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously .    3.1204836587836216
we are extremely concerned about moves by the cuban government over the last year that have further UNK public freedom , moves like changes in the penal code and the scope of the death penalty .    3.064800813869227
we are also worried by the recent increase in the number of political detentions .    3.3028478632322265
we are monitoring the human rights situation through the reports of ngos and the work of our human rights working group based in the eu UNK in havana .    3.9648150867953373
we have regularly put our criticisms to the cuban authorities , and this parliament has done the same .    3.8573535039054345
but i do not believe that the right approach is to try to isolate cuba .    3.8544005379744606
we want a fair and open society in cuba , a cuba which respects the principles of the market , the UNK of contract and the rule of law .    3.775793543955359
we want to encourage a process of transition to democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms .    2.8949612903612008
my views are exactly the same when it comes to the third subject with which i wish to deal , namely china .    3.985085091488375
quite simply , i want us to be engaged with china .    3.8455504118955433
it would be self - UNK and self - UNK , as well as insulting to over a fifth of humanity , to want anything else .    3.672367236625601
i also want to see a china transformed by peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not lock up democracy UNK or religious UNK .    2.9114751378259287
so what should we do ?    2.8955287150018116
it is a UNK to talk about a world trade organisation which does not include china - or russia , for that matter .    3.813977313138966
but i do not believe today , nor have i ever believed , that our burgeoning economic relationship with china - manifested , for example , by china ' s eur 25 billion surplus with the european union - should silence us when it comes to china ' s human rights record .    3.495331033753746
for me the question is not whether we should address the question of human rights in china - we have a duty to do so and a legitimate interest in doing so - but rather what is the most effective way of doing this ?    4.664736386680136
so what should be our attitude towards a geneva resolution this year ?    3.111814658700355
as the presidency has noted , the union as a whole is considering its position .    3.9647377808248843
but i strongly suggest there are a number of factors of which the member states ought to take proper account .    4.364444881217584
first , while some people question whether tabling a geneva resolution makes any difference , several of the most distinguished chinese advocates of democracy strongly believe that it is a valuable move , not least because of the message it sends to people in china itself .    3.7027272055075806
that is a point that deserves serious consideration .    3.1220547577064015
chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in tibet .    4.178898392047478
we have made our views very clear to them .    2.909666599831637
while we all know that for many people in china there has been a real long - term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties , there is a dark side to the picture as well .    4.20529394913955
critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with china .    3.801187689240814
that is true and potentially valuable , although i have to say - and i have said to chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked .    4.397447131385273
of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement eu cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres .    3.7848916502016436
that is very welcome and i also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level .    3.4160783059464928
naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long - term process , but i wish i could point to more real gains .    4.743177178073623
the next dialogue in lisbon on 25 february will be an important test .    3.5165997632939283
it will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not .    3.226214153220431
what , finally , do we want to see as the first steps ?    4.707082271845487
well , for example , we would like to see china move from signing the un conventions on civil and political rights and on social and cultural rights UNK actually ratifying them .    3.337161278495766
i wish we were closer to that .    3.1833896609096333
i repeat that member states will have to make up their minds .    3.9032152264400106
what i hope is , first , that we in europe will adopt a common position and stick to it , that we will not allow some to be UNK off , that our position will not be based on self - UNK or UNK , that it will be a common position and a sensible position .    5.507186461132895
i know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions .    3.5230853128816686
but if that is true , then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward .    3.9162713946769045
that , in my judgement , is the challenge for the next few weeks .    5.1376289565481095
i am grateful to the house for its concern about human rights around the world , and particularly in china .    3.4606222193079277
thank you very much , commissioner patten .    2.033338651678401
we will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the un human rights commission and proceed to the vote .    3.2048401220166975
welcome    3.743268227627731
i am delighted to welcome a delegation of the hong kong legislative council to parliament .    2.7275672114483913

the commission can also accept amendment no 4 in principle .    2.983707420685064
the commission cannot accept amendments nos 3 , 5 , 6 , 12 , 14 , 18 and 16 .    2.5730711587085597

report ( a5 - 0015 / 2000 ) by mr graefe zu baringdorf , on behalf of the committee on agriculture and rural development , on the proposal for a council directive amending directive 70 / 524 / eec concerning additives in feedingstuffs ( com ( 1999 ) 388 - c5 - 0134 / 1999 - 1999 / 0168 ( cns )    1.9401460833468573
before the final vote :    3.928455255936776
. ( de ) mr president , following this vote , i would like to ask the competent commissioner , mr byrne , if , now that he has seen how much support there is in this chamber , he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments ?    4.568402760026734
. i regret to say that i believe that the thought - out position i advanced yesterday is the correct position .    3.886429467473541
the comprehensive approach that the commission intends to adopt on this issue will be brought forward as soon as possible under article 152 where parliament will have a codecision function .    4.399875488701156
that is the appropriate way of dealing with this .    3.4429909605101163
mr president , in accordance with article 69 ( 2 ) , i call for referral back to committee .    2.62723164491385
the reason is that this concerns the approximation of a legal effect measure , as proposed by the commission .    3.220515906351961
we have accepted this but have proposed further approximations of the legal effect measures that affect this directive , in particular the adoption of a text - which has been approved by the commission overall - for the use and labelling of genetically modified organisms .    4.318055386360792
we take the view that this should form part of this approximation at this time , but the commission will not adopt this .    4.853839725874786
i believe that , in accordance with article 69 ( 2 ) , we must endeavour to enter into discussion with the commission , and i would therefore urge my fellow meps to decide in favour of referral back to committee .    3.906995179622075

before the vote :    3.261533374175327
mr president , permit me to say quite publicly to mrs stenzel , who is a member of the övp executive , that many meps are horrified that you have entered into a coalition with haider , and that we wish to denounce you for doing so !    3.926661749421712
( applause from the left . heckling from the right )    3.2643477473075646
. ( de ) mr cohn - bendit , i do not think that the european parliament has any business intervening to such a huge extent in a country ' s domestic politics , in the way that you are doing .    3.931894631454926
i can speak for my party , which championed austria ' s membership of the european union in the early days .    3.8108069891563723
as a political force , we serve to guarantee that austria will continue to embrace european values .    3.802170591937143
i refuse to allow myself to be UNK for internal and party political reasons !    3.7068416631426357
this does not reflect the truth of the situation but is pure propaganda .    3.578059743029075
i utterly reject this !    3.147799637143213

welcome    3.743268227627731
this is perhaps an appropriate moment to welcome to the official gallery , a delegation of four members of the moroccan parliament , led by mr UNK UNK , deputy speaker of the chamber of representatives .    3.7918769526544773
we are honoured by the visit of this delegation which is taking place shortly before the entry into force on 1 march 2000 of the association agreement between morocco and the european union .    3.219847222299469
on this historic occasion we welcome these developments in our relations and the prospects for closer ties between our two parliaments .    3.1980042546519143
it is in this spirit that the delegation for relations with the UNK countries will be visiting morocco on 20 to 22 march .    3.005311130413039
i hope the delegation has an excellent visit to strasbourg .    3.1435508722782917
mr president , i just want to take advantage of your welcome to the delegation by pointing out that the house also has the pleasure of welcoming the heads of the austrian anti - racist associations who are UNK us with a visit .    3.4869009865064804

report ( a5 - 0033 / 2000 ) by mr andersson , on behalf of the committee on employment and social affairs , on the communication from the commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection ( com ( 1999 ) 347 - c5 - 0253 / 1999 - 1999 / 2182 ( cos )    2.2625176108320515
( parliament adopted the resolution ) president .    2.2377140112237717
that concludes the vote    3.055383178538322
explanations of vote - lienemann report ( a5 - 0014 / 2000 )    3.0220654803289424
. ( fr ) i welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on life .    4.024957789044091
i shall briefly remind you that life is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the european union and also in third countries , whether they be neighbouring countries around the mediterranean , countries around the baltic sea or applicant countries .    3.42342999533313
the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection has proposed many amendments which have , for the most part , been retained in the common position adopted by the council .    2.9338249460725976
as far as the third phase of life ( 2000 - 2004 ) is concerned , the instrument is to be divided into three sections , life - nature ( 47 % of the resources ) , life - environment ( 47 % ) and life - third countries ( 6 % ) .    3.533345132880199
in my opinion , the most important amendments concern the following :    3.780302569479512
improving the efficiency , transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of life , procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public , and procedures for cooperation between recipients ;    4.142159748190332
the objectives of life : this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development , in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the urban initiative , on which i have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere ;    4.085690953827666
the contribution that the projects supported by life make to the sustainability of social and economic activities , and thus job creation .    3.964137978593779
i consider it crucial that the life instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern europe .    3.0094102628502992
the other candidate countries ( e . g . cyprus , turkey , malta ) my also take part in life when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries .    2.9898237843126974
the stumbling block in the negotiations with the council lies , of course , in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the life programme ( 2000 - 2004 ) .    3.7683814812120935
the commission proposal , ratified by the council , is for eur 613 million , whilst the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection considers that the budget should be eur 850 million .    3.392999410222687
i support mrs lienemann ' s firm stance .    3.0912171713501526
the financial allocation has not in fact been UNK since the programme was created , even when the membership of the ec was increased to fifteen member states following enlargement .    3.867823198048439
if the report is adopted in plenary session , then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened , in accordance with the codecision procedure , in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme .    4.260656660609409
this type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions !    3.4754849595127006
böge report ( a5 - 0023 / 2000 )    3.217545415278818
. ( fr ) as an mep and , more importantly , as a consumer , i welcome the european commission ' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the european union .    3.8527838205942073
this proposal has two objectives : first , to amend the 1991 council directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and , secondly , to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating UNK UNK UNK ( tse ) or bse - type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species .    3.3389574358265457
what is interesting UNK this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie .    3.945724023776895
what is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow - up report on the mad cow crisis .    4.252084428792533
i also consider it essential , for the sake of coherence , that existing legislation on scrapie , which is limited to the trade in UNK and UNK animals , should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on tse affecting all animals throughout the european union , rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs .    4.3441235792807165
these rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie .    3.5041397583283023
a number of scientific UNK maintain that scrapie developed into bse in cows and therefore caused the bse epidemic .    2.8852787090474163
even if this proposal for a european parliament and council regulation to prevent and combat certain tse needs to be made more accurate and more effective , especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie , it is still a UNK improvement .    3.9566735171780425
it is a pledge to european citizens , who have voiced their concern , as regards european food policy , on many occasions .    4.146754985960581
the european parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard .    3.7625103336641357
as a result of the debates on the principle of precaution , traceability , responsibility and transparency , the european commission has presented a white paper on food safety .    3.4201485356928036
this white paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent european food authority as part of a european strategy to restore consumer confidence .    3.819070764343657
it is up to us , as responsible europeans , to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive .    3.211027853210467
cederschiöld report ( a5 - 0008 / 2000 )    2.673064540285408
mr president , i voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because i believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the european parliament .    3.4922978490874725
in my view , products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products , namely , those that can be seen and touched .    3.3639416461022105
the fruits of the UNK and science , which are UNK , are of inestimable importance . therefore , the european community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement , not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving , through the knowledge and experience they have acquired , to give future generations something better than that which they have today .    4.459959660141424
. ( da ) we oppose , on principle , the european community ' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the member states .    3.4641272030408423
we are nonetheless aware that we are concerned here with a sharing of powers between the member states and the community . at the same time , we appreciate the fact that the wipo treaties are a significant step forward in the direction of guaranteeing the rights of UNK and UNK artists .    4.176033823829203
we are therefore voting in favour of the recommendation .    3.1558470388090107
- ( de ) the group of the greens / european free alliance abstained from the vote on this matter because , in the plenary debate of the previous day , commissioner bolkestein did not respond to any of my questions regarding eu accession to the wipo treaties .    3.5237978429851005
in institutional terms , there has been no clarification of what role the ep is to play in the further development of the wipo treaties .    3.6184726027873224
in addition , there is a clear tendency , in matters of international jurisdiction , more and more often to obtain a pure eu jurisdiction .    3.5096385824506333
when it is , then , still not clear to what extent the ep can participate in the decision - making processes , the question of legitimacy arises .    4.164413920917864
moreover , the concept of ' author ' is not defined in the treaties .    3.0350249726264313
in this regard , too , the commission has not answered the question as to what definition it wishes to base its discussions on , and whether it wishes to settle foreseeable conflicts by imposing its own definition of the law on others .    3.476554937788279
one of the UNK aspects is the public interest : will ratifying and applying wipo lead to the privatisation of culture ?    3.615287259979091
and , finally , the matter of the relationship between trips and wipo must be clarified . regarding this , too , there has been only silence by way of a response from the commission .    4.091544604650663
if nothing helpful is forthcoming in the course of a parliamentary debate planned for clarification and orientation , then we must at least abstain from voting .    3.283821591128989
graefe zu baringdorf ( a5 - 0015 / 2000 )    3.507857609403786
. ( pt ) food safety issues are in the spotlight following the bse and dioxin scandals .    3.2433405287101063
gmos are still the subject of great uncertainty , both in terms of their environmental impact and of their effects on human and animal health .    3.9839214455885688
the precautionary principle must therefore apply in the absence of scientific certainty .    3.9442017114583927
the profit motive is very much behind the present food safety crises .    3.61246457414399
furthermore , he considers that " genetically modified additives shall be clearly identified as such on any label or any document , official or otherwise , which is UNK to or UNK the additive " .    3.5563411564284775
this will facilitate greater control and traceability of such additives and guarantee the consumer ' s freedom of choice .    3.193206822075626
in view of the montreal protocol on genetically modified organisms ( gmos ) , i welcome the fact that the rapporteur has included these issues in his report , and i have therefore voted in favour of it .    3.809018876985249
stenzel report ( a5 - 0034 / 2000 )    3.3771424403643944
mr president , i would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote , on behalf of the ppe group on the equal report .    3.2836779638781044
we have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the socialist group .    3.1499404199254046
the socialist group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been .    4.375925542819919
this is why we are abstaining .    2.6532177707323235
we want to ensure that the equal report , which is very important for refugees , the elderly , the handicapped and women , simply goes ahead .    4.209788328888525
it is regrettable that , due to the procedure , the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session .    3.783429646139826
this is actually in conflict with european values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this parliament .    3.4630058322111656
these were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report .    3.0285833151146386
we want equal to go ahead .    3.17177720482987
we assent to the main thrust of it , but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage .    4.5242713141409245
i also abstained for another reason . i think the time has come for the european institutions to stop UNK and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give european citizens some firm indication regarding what europe wants europe to be .    3.7252008672116155
the time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice .    2.575178960762238
. ( da ) we have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the commission concerning the guidelines for eu initiative programmes ( cip ) .    2.5351824907396234
basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have simply adopted a position on the issue .    3.1423849798019865
we think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report .    3.6761984420863025
. ( fr ) we did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market .    3.817339762842881
nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague , all too pie in the sky .    3.8799139711420985
and yet , in the chapter on aid and training for refugees , the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to " refugees within the meaning of the geneva convention " .    3.498075976788779
this restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout europe are in a drastic situation , with no protection , forced to work on the black market , and to hide , while so - called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down .    4.034918879583817
the first thing we need to do in this area is to give these stateless people the legal means to live a decent life and be able to work without being relegated to the status of UNK , the victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple forms of administrative and police harassment , the main form of which is having to live in permanent fear of expulsion .    4.193690132210041
.    2.4274255028413507
i voted in favour of mrs stenzel ' s report on the equal initiative as i believe that it is essential to continue the work begun under the previous now , horizon , youthstart and integra strands of the adapt and employment initiatives .    3.8841034032497266
the lessons we have learned under these actions must be built on .    3.4952562773467757
equal stands for " equality " .    3.241265921843272
it must be seen to deliver .    3.5186488595492125
i welcome the proposed concentration on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and any form of inequality in the labour market .    3.011511439259888
i also favour the desire to move away from an out - dated format and to bring partners together in search of innovative ways to tackle unemployment .    3.1482748679641306
there must be flexibility .    2.7944573009147926
i deeply regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative .    3.0792414989064927
in the last programming period 9 % of structural funds were available for community initiatives .    3.5106005037698145
the figure is now 5 . 35 % .    3.246866060988224
this means that funds must be used to achieve maximum effect and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly disseminated .    3.0452435211895206
the employment and social affairs committee adopted several of the amendments i put forward , concerning for example , the emphasis on access to start - up capital , how to exploit new business opportunities in cities , towns and rural areas and the criticism that under the previous initiatives there was inadequate participation by business .    3.7043385570224014
this often meant that good projects did not lead to real job opportunities .    3.328581167706682
the positive experience of innovative actions of small promoters was jeopardised by their distance from the policy process .    3.1381676719884712
i also stressed the need for prevention .    3.8966430502688127
the involvement of the social partners also needs to be highlighted .    4.122785047227613
there must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced as a priority .    2.9820838368954177
there must be flexibility also for countries with small budgets .    2.816957519759536
while there are some aspects of the report which i believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall i believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported .    4.128905735227054
.    2.4274255028413507
( pt ) the commission intends to use the community initiative equal to replace the community employment and adapt initiatives and various UNK in these areas , such as now , on new opportunities for women , horizon , for disabled persons , youthstart , for promoting the labour market integration of young people , and integra , for groups threatened with exclusion . unfortunately , this involves a significant reduction in appropriations .    3.588487242164001
accordingly , the commission will use this initiative to develop what it considers to be new ways of fighting discrimination and inequality of all kinds in the labour market , based on the four pillars of the employment policy guidelines .    3.5338977217969796
this is a great deal to build on such fragile foundations .    3.1326057020380236
however , in order to give this new approach some chance of success , the commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal , a more simple and direct one , involving the ngos from the outset , so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way .    3.9432328023952086
the commission did not do that .    3.177897686597668
we hope that it will at least revisit the aspects that we have mentioned .    4.257299353820013
mr president , some of us in parliament will remember the successful film , " UNK " , in which some elderly people UNK a special kind of water that made them young again .    3.706847378957155
for that reason , i approved these measures , but i should also like to express the hope that there will be particularly rigorous monitoring of water UNK at the point where it enters our houses , to ensure that it is of the highest level .    4.35690212096303
in the measures that have been adopted , i note that support for people who UNK their water in their own homes has been omitted . i trust that this will be remedied in the future .    4.275898108699011
apart from amendment no 76 , which was an error , since i intended to vote in favour , the rest of my votes can be explained by means of the following UNK situation :    4.088269238155854
supposed draft environmental directive : " european parliament and council directive establishing the obligation to maintain , during winter , a temperature of no less than eighteen degrees centigrade in the streets , UNK and parks of the cities of europe " .    3.556232017954175
guidelines of the directive : a ) each city shall provide the means , in terms of energy and technology , sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012 ; b ) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices .    3.922265490063988
opinion of an mep from the north of europe : " this directive would be unfair since , for example , the cost for an inhabitant of stockholm would be two hundred times greater than the cost for an inhabitant of UNK " .    3.0240611866202136
opinion of an mep from the south of europe : " nevertheless , this is a question of competitivity and equality of conditions " .    3.4733003951623234
in explaining my vote , i must say that it is positive that there is a community directive on water , but i believe that environmental dogma will not lead to the construction of europe , but will lead to legislative UNK .    5.500385492950206
we cannot give equal treatment to countries which suffer from floods and droughts , such as the mediterranean countries , and countries with northern levels of rainfall .    3.4422193996914094
furthermore , it would show a lack of solidarity to make transfers of water , between different river basins , practically impossible in the future .    3.667504612572429
once more we must remember that we are undergoing a continental project for political union .    3.916920123900251
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) drinking , eating , washing , farming - water UNK each act of our daily life and we treat it , wrongly , as an UNK and UNK resource .    3.3391509677945943
a simple gesture such as turning on a UNK seems to bring water straight from the source .    3.1349015927355515
but the source is threatening to run dry .    3.130815542167754
but tomorrow will be too late .    3.3327268562114014
we have to lay down the rules of play today , before we all lose .    3.704276973220556
in adopting the water directive on wednesday 15 february , the european parliament confirmed its wish to protect surface water , coastal UNK , inland waters and groundwater .    3.3839051280524455
europe now has a framework which will allow it to prevent any deterioration in the quality of water , promote its sustainable use , protect eco - systems , help fight floods and droughts and eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances .    3.304930889023762
. ( fr ) it is with the greatest satisfaction that i welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy .    2.6308123909451417
the ecological disaster on the banks of the danube is a reminder , as if we needed one , that all too often human negligence jeopardises natural resources such as water .    3.4522552527838717
the objective of this proposal for a directive , which dates back to 1997 , is to put an end to the fragmentation of previous water legislation and protect surface water , coastal waters , inland waters and groundwater .    3.2772812711423795
it provides a framework within which we can prevent any further deterioration , protect ecosystems , promote sustainable water use , help to fight floods and drought and gradually eliminate the disposal of dangerous substances .    3.078798085960481
specific directives will then be adopted within this framework .    4.084184049071253
the procedure involved in drafting this text was lengthy .    3.1908980140153695
the proposal for a directive was amended twice , first in 1997 and then in 1998 .    3.1481612865271402
a technical working party made up of council and parliament representatives met in january 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions .    3.5483166208627765
as far as the timetable and objectives are concerned , the council ' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive , while the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy wants this reduced to 10 years .    3.3413790858684247
the committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020 , the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020 .    3.5352470113096484
the council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years , but the commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years .    3.4609193906477183
all the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years , not 16 .    3.590559172871555
i must say that i support these reduced deadlines , especially as provision is made for derogations .    3.2228446313767365
as far as costs are concerned , i approve the proposal whereby member states will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources .    3.5531028832968152
i likewise expect the european commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012 .    4.040925041550738
i will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the committee on the environment , which needs no further comment : " water is not a commercial product like any other but , rather , a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the european union and which must be protected , defended and treated as such " .    3.622052966923535
. i wish to put on the official record my concerns with the lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote .    3.689104214997416
we have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water .    3.582004908872143
there is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur .    4.110605843899367
however , the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which , under the rules of subsidiarity , should be left to the member states for decision .    5.273524584953179
in my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common european charge for this issue .    3.087556211789196
in ireland all the major users of water , commercial , industrial and agricultural , already pay for their use of water .    3.44482386815874
this is a decision of national and local government , and this is where all future decisions should be retained .    4.132183639826251
these are the main reasons for my vote .    2.5902397157360135
. the european union is currently in the process of adopting new eu water legislation to update and to establish a long - term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters .    4.089201475726243
i support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy .    3.2755753725721943
however , i do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used .    3.1485682721686636
water , in this context , is a commercial commodity .    5.292525558065603
it is an essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient supplies for normal daily life .    2.8135478548178527
we all know that water is a commodity without which mankind cannot live and that it is imperative that its quality should be preserved .    3.448988933402227
but it is also essential to bear in mind that the various elements of water policy cannot be separated , and that action on this aspect will affect all the others .    3.7793071931419293
the " UNK - chemical and ecological quality of water " was highlighted during the debate and in the proposals , and the adverse effects of other aspects was , at best , touched upon marginally .    4.142368934555414
it is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different member states , such as specific climatic conditions , water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year , the social , economic and ecological effects of applying standards , and also of the failure to do so .    3.8321975853077257
it was because of our concern about these issues that we disagreed with some of the proposals put forward by the committee on the environment , public health and consumer policy , and in particular those relating to an excessively restrictive timetable and to the scant attention paid to social and agricultural aspects , which are very important for a country like portugal , which suffers from water shortage problems and also inadequate socio - economic development .    3.554270625509261
but we also believe that , in many cases , the proposals put forward by the commission and the council represent too much of a step backwards , which is why we would like to see a vote balanced between the various requirements in the proposals presented to us .    4.1709650606289115
it is minimalist on a number of points , especially with regard to the dates of entry into force of far too many provisions and the number of , and conditions for , implementing the derogations .    3.8587130732373516
however , the main problem is with the definition of the objective which the european union wishes to pursue with this text .    3.9859999725368724
the objective is of course to create , first and foremost , a clear general framework which will allow the law in this area to be simplified .    3.8911420409310047
however the union should be seeking , beyond that , to improve the quality of both surface and groundwater .    3.8591798069259995
public health and the supply of drinking water are at stake , as are biological quality and diversity and the conservation of rural areas and species .    4.1349395425253865
from this point of view , the common position is weak .    3.31337735908564
i should like to see our parliament defend a more ambitious position than the council ' s position , but i should also like that position to be equally credible .    3.8290732264310057
the " zero input " and " zero pollution " requirement , including for substances naturally present in water , is not realistic .    3.514551689859879
i am not one of those meps who thinks that it is essential to adopt " extremist " amendments at second reading with the sole aim of gaining room for manoeuvre in preparation for negotiations with the council of ministers .    3.2042742163611897
on the contrary , i object to this systematically applied strategy .    2.6040776172656637
it damages parliament .    3.510415198045976
our messages to our citizens and to the council are muddled and lack credibility .    4.8982770886554095
overly strict , unrealistic environmental objectives will not be applied because they are UNK .    4.345378197389033
there is one other specific point which is dear to me : member states should be able , if they so wish , to set up trans - national water transfers .    3.6317444802847256
this type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity , which we have always defended , and , as such , should enjoy the widespread support of the european union in the context of the promotion of trans - european networks and regional policy ( through the structural funds ) .    4.447898600344266
i would like to remind the house that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans - european water networks two years ago and i would be most obliged if the european commission could shortly tell parliament what action it has taken on that report .    3.752479024371695
.    2.4274255028413507
( es ) we have seen a report concerned with water quality in europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war .    3.417077890730362
we all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective , above all , given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment .    3.272503151886164
it is clear that this model ' s logic of private profit has been harmful , and therefore the ' polluter pays ' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences .    3.0263745273183695
however , apart from these principles , there is the consideration that water , as a common resource , cannot be subjected to the rules of the market .    4.30344277184412
surprisingly , i imagine with the best of intentions , this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers , and especially the agricultural sector , responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality .    3.553280315682967
in fact , water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market .    3.323686135859804
this means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water .    2.8716985152158276
by failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant , and is therefore not a problem , from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity , stifling the chances of any economic and social development , we are UNK the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon .    3.9571333426575825
in the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity , which is scarce in some areas , while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use , to those who live in drought areas .    4.206074779435997
as a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity , my vote has been consistent with what i have said , as an mep from one of the dry mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely , the region of UNK .    3.546698131083784
. on behalf of the european parliament labour party , i wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the lienemann report , we have certain reservations .    5.135248874495328
the timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable , but the timetable set by the council of UNK is too far in the distance .    4.766532037892236
we believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date .    3.1743147277571016
we have voted against amendments nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal UNK pollution in all groundwater .    3.06744325232138
we believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near UNK standard .    3.2188227322615264
the UNK is the reason for our vote .    4.325288312291009
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed .    3.0226150305049098
the framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of community policy in this area .    3.013229269296103
it has clear , ambitious objectives .    3.1884930287515454
we share them .    2.8359319635972953
it sets environmental parameters close to zero .    3.0465091495826275
but we feel that it would be UNK not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet .    3.434165160794071
the legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation , i . e . to stop discharges within 20 years , would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances .    3.371132765457132
such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross - border areas and in candidate countries , thereby complicating enlargement .    3.517876211079775
i should like , naturally , to refer to a specific sector to which i am very closely attached , i . e . agriculture , the main water - consuming sector . agriculture must accept its share of ' polluter pays ' charges , and has in fact already started to do so , but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints , especially in arid regions .    3.9678177433514374
as regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances , i am of course in favour of controls , but the question arises of the legal basis , which comes under the euratom treaty .    4.374397452836815
andersson report ( a5 - 0033 / 2000 )    3.261956697749588
the group for a europe of democracies and diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the andersson report . this does , of course , contain a number of good observations .    3.619310257915211
for example , it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that " the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the member states make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the member states ' social security systems " .    4.391410406160005
now , the concept of " uniform harmonisation " is one of those muddled expressions which totally UNK the integration process in question . it is also true , as it states in the explanatory statement , that harmonisation could be damaging as " it might place greater demands on weaker member states at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security .    3.4155548178134563
no - one would benefit from this type of harmonisation " .    2.9131535694777186
the situation , however , is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation , and uniform harmonisation into the bargain .    3.4592551008808656
paragraph d points out that " the union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria " , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the ecofin council and the social affairs and employment councils .    4.350940749205308
finally , paragraph 7 emphasises that " the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination " . and , in this regard , we approach the heart of the matter .    3.3393731413772714
this project , with its social harmonisation , does not constitute social policy . instead , it is an extension to the eu ' s emu project , which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside emu and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship , namely great britain , sweden and denmark .    4.1769706525884205
it is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the emu project .    3.6989186746568845
) mr president , i voted for the council ' s strategy for modernising social protection because , in my view , it constitutes a step towards the establishment of european social and pensions legislation , although it does not actually go the whole way .    4.123776765211437
i was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote , since i believe that , in essence , the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly , despite the fact that , as we all know , the governments of the 15 member states would like to reduce pensions to the minimum .    4.924123745216978
i hope that parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions .    3.3965099926713025
the elderly are waiting for the european parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now .    4.20580370045266
the countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the european union that guarantee better social protection .    3.924591660733644
. ( da ) the danish social democrats in the european parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our swedish social democratic colleague , jan andersson , on the commission ' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .    2.9524331064605573
the starting point for the commission ' s communication is the implementation of emu which , with its demand for stability and growth , creates the basis for the member states ' being able to maintain their social security arrangements .    4.269752039288848
the report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but , rather , better use of available resources .    3.928233682433367
we also notice that , according to the explanatory statement , modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements , either , and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker member states at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back .    3.2853212032071952
no - one would benefit from this situation .    2.675785309723204
both in the communication from the commission and in the report by mr andersson , it is emphasised that it is the member states which have responsibility for and , therefore , also determine the content of , social security arrangements .    5.573889506847004
cooperation on these matters within the framework of the eu should create added value , based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing , the aim being to define best practice .    4.195333340582983
. ( sv ) we consider that the report contains many practical proposals , which we support , but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report .    4.000739833325068
in particular , we oppose the sections which deal with fiscal harmonisation and with the commission ' s becoming involved in telling the member states what to do ( see , for example , paragraph 7 ) .    4.093862236355001
we wish to emphasise that the sphere of social and social security policy should chiefly be the domain of the member states , even if the enlargement of the eu requires a greater degree of coordination than there has been in the past .    4.347315859449023
. ( fr ) the current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment , poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending .    3.114879146625086
the policies of the european union also have much to answer for in this situation .    4.551866375206944
of course we need to modernise these systems .    3.6659652713202093
in france , in particular , we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions .    3.422780387709408
we also need to reform UNK management methods which create UNK , chaos and waste .    2.7916972243327973
more importantly , we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic , monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and UNK the internal market so that we can create jobs .    4.638690148526598
the commission and the andersson report are not proposing a social policy ; they are giving brussels UNK decision - making powers as regards funding , i . e . as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of europe , which is why we voted against this text .    4.2698731558521255
social protection should be an expression , first and foremost , of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost , exclusively in fact , under the jurisdiction of the nation state .    3.6533689536144083
social protection should be based on the principle of national and community preferences .    4.111373368386819
otherwise it is merely the financial processing , at the expense and to the detriment of european citizens , of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration .    4.629947754268146
.    2.4274255028413507
( sv ) we have abstained from voting for jan andersson ' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security .    2.6954148347128695
we are basically well disposed towards the european union .    3.1458268687234248
as swedish liberals , we see european integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross - border problems such as the environment , trade , movement across borders , human rights and conflict management .    4.353327106555896
in these areas , europe ' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .    3.5301020983662204
we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect .    3.9896112747825994
that is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the european union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see .    3.861662700202562
it must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the eu will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with , which is to say cross - border issues .    4.398928027010573
all other questions ought to be dealt with at local , regional or national levels .    3.510093022405331
social policy is an example of an area in which the eu ought only to have limited powers , except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the union .    4.028880400555092
each member state ought to have full responsibility for , and the right UNK to decide upon , its social security systems .    4.28339186148888
health care , child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational .    3.4606731728032445
the same applies to labour market policy .    2.921796923243774
we do not believe that common european legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security .    3.681887289773931
for us , it is important that the eu should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use .    4.534026143884473
that does not , however , prevent the member states from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere .    4.123632205465363
equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our liberal agenda .    3.587807801327928
we wholeheartedly support , at national level , many of the ideas presented in mr andersson ' s report .    3.4613973090998957
. ( it ) the report gives a clear impression that the concerted strategy for modernising social protection in europe will be accompanied by an UNK process of cohesion .    3.2458171368737703
we therefore view it with interest and hope and commend its intentions .    3.006112411818992
numerous policies have already gone in this direction , albeit UNK , and many more still need to do so before europe , in terms of subsidiarity , is seen as one house , not only by its own people , but also by those in the candidate countries .    4.769223645613948
moreover , the european welfare systems have always played a constructive role in the social and democratic development of each nation .    3.9694703726534266
consequently , if such systems are to continue to sustain development in the future , in light of the economic and employment changes taking place , as well as the requirements of society , modernisation is absolutely essential .    4.26819425559563
there are three main aspects that need to be highlighted .    3.521073458669669
the first is that economic policy , employment and social protection should be strictly interdependent in a way that is directly proportional .    3.4399240934693425
the second concerns the management of welfare systems and those who operate them .    3.536186581315032
nowadays , it is becoming more commonplace , as well as efficient , to operate complementary and integrated protection schemes .    4.147680450519862
but , in our view , that does not mean that the role of the public authority should be reduced , either as regards the universality or , we hope , the quality of the basic social protection provided .    4.47695838015962
it is , to a large extent , a principle of justice that UNK both health and pension schemes as well as social assistance , where , in particular , strategic coordination by the public authority is essential , even though it has been modernised .    4.0164961915281925
the third aspect concerns the principle of subsidiarity that underpins the european union .    3.1081121299440087
today , a common strategy for social protection is sadly lacking , and the current systems are , in the main , run according to the actions and unity of purpose of individual member states .    4.346126113575468
therefore , any modernisation process has to take account of economic , employment and social protection differences between the various countries , whether member states or candidate countries .    4.303424301537902
what is required is that those responsible for the modernisation process , which continues to be closely linked to the promotion of social cohesion despite the underlying differences , should have the will and the know - how to ensure that changes are for the better and not for the worse .    4.131198338888317
it is , after all , a matter of civilisation , progress and common dignity for the present european union and a future enlarged community .    3.468853546076042
. ( sv ) the basic values common to the member states of the european union are based upon democracy , human freedoms and rights , and a social market economy .    3.728566667215625
in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , it is the member states themselves which devise their own social security systems .    3.509536617719304
inhabitants of countries in the european union ought , nonetheless , to be able to benefit from a minimum network of social protection , irrespective of which country they live in .    4.636123069813449
the report seeks " effective and ambitious fiscal coordination " , without going on to define more specifically what this means .    2.896229392038287
as we see it , such a position constitutes unduly large interference in national fiscal policy and cannot , therefore , be supported .    3.3392853695356592
we are therefore voting against paragraph 7 of the report .    3.0204152693634594
the report emphasises the social dimension of european cooperation , which is something to be welcomed .    3.7360295280348463
it is nonetheless important to clarify what role the eu is to play , and not to play , with regard to social security .    4.267138873573015
clarification of this kind is missing from the report , which is unfortunate .    5.303600185154804
. ( el ) on reading the commission ' s statement on social protection , which is UNK by so many good intentions , one wonders whether its authors and the working people in europe are living on the same continent and in the same social reality .    4.280223353527491
one also wonders whether this ' coordinated modernisation strategy ' is not just another misrepresentation of the coordinated and headlong attack on social protection and security and on the acquired rights of working people .    3.683360989156307
we agree with many of the rapporteur ' s remarks but do not at all share his optimism about the commission ' s and the council ' s intentions and plans concerning social protection .    4.171965120133735
the general lines of the implemented economic policy , the stability pact and the strict convergence programmes , which are a constant menace to employment and which promote employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations , and the organisation of labour , along with commission and the esf decisions relating to salary and wage restraint , and the insistence upon austere budgetary discipline and upon achieving much - UNK monetary stability at all costs , leave no doubt about the new strategy ' s objectives and aspirations .    3.706599222142527
its sole purpose is to pave the way and create the right conditions for cutting public expenditure on social security , and for UNK social protection itself .    3.820817812821686
when social security has repeatedly , and in the words of many influential people , been characterised as a ' cost ' and an ' obstacle ' to greater competitiveness and when ways are being sought to transfer that cost from companies to working people - always , of course , on the pretext that this will create jobs - it would surprise us if the existing model of market economy without accountability , with its dismal monetary - economic approach to everything and total dependence on monopolistic interests , were to take under its protection the fundamental right of the citizens to social protection and care .    3.617954745592101
clearly , what is being attempted is to move away from organised systems of social security under state control , towards systems based on private insurance agencies , which will generate new profits for capital and place even greater burdens on working people , who besides the higher cost , will ' enjoy ' even more UNK social provisions .    3.47879105283197
the UNK of illicit competition between public and private social security systems and between the systems of the member states is not only unjustifiable , but , on the contrary , makes manifest the political UNK and intolerable pressures imposed upon social security systems to weaken or even do away with them , to the benefit of the private sector and the law of profit .    4.198111781756773
it is well known that the level and quality of employment determines the quality of social security systems .    3.6046294966175294
so how is it possible to speak about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems when we are faced with the millions of unemployed , impoverished and marginalised people , the ' working poor ' of part - time employment , and working conditions that are UNK from the policies implemented ?    3.793025703277231
social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in europe , and were achieved after many years of UNK against the aspirations of big business , and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people .    3.6206214250931574
today , in the europe of unemployment and UNK , it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people , but this demands a different system of economic and social development , which the eu cannot possibly create , because of its nature and character .    5.288050537651343
on the basis of these views , we wish to express our categorical opposition to the ' modernisation ' of the social protection system that the commission statement is promoting , and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the committee on employment and social affairs which is under discussion .    4.130662157506593
that concludes the explanations of vote .    2.9017869722304823
next session of un human rights commission ( continuation )    2.7970563984314887
the next item is the debate on the council declaration on the establishing of the eu priorities for the next session of the un commission on human rights ( 20 march 2000 ) , including the situation in china .    3.6345835499414547
mr president , i regret the absence of the presidency - in - office of the council . this is a council declaration , and i believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate .    4.278706855754959
i think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need , which has been expressed by all the political groups , for parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the united nations commission on human rights in geneva , so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue , one which is so dear to this house .    4.508027672402686
following the statement of the presidency - in - office of the council and the commission , i believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see .    4.339413540756779
at a european union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory , since , for example , although the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms is a common instrument in all member states , not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them .    4.447938157487351
another clear UNK in this area is the fact that the european union itself is not a signatory to the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails .    4.17516185562757
i hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the european union charter on fundamental rights .    3.8701437951806215
with regard to foreign affairs , i believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution UNK illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism , mr president . issues such as the abolition of the death penalty , the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world , demand a clear , visible and effective response from the european union .    4.244987752085558
in my opinion , this resolution contains a series of essential points , but i would like to stress one in particular , that is , the need for greater coordination between the european union and the united nations .    4.040170031983125
mr president , in a world such as this , which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation , and not only in the economic field , our responses , in order to be effective , must be concerted and coordinated .    4.564045691998153
this parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the commission on human rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and , mr president - in - office of the council , this parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible .    4.207784945848026
soon , in may , the european commission intends to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratisation in the union ' s external relations .    5.598842229916645
i would like to take this opportunity to ask the commission to take good note of this need for coordination , which i have just mentioned , and to seek new formulas which will strengthen the role played by the european union in the field of human rights and , in particular , by this parliament , especially from the point of view of coherence , recognising the good will of those third countries which accept the inclusion of the democratic clause .    3.831831909722704
i believe that this should be applied to all areas , in particular also the budgetary area .    4.331558618703764
lastly , i must recognise the important contributions made by civil society in this area , as well as the often underestimated role of the numerous non - governmental organisations who act on the ground .    3.9760832010062384
the union must make every effort to provide all the necessary support for them to carry out their important work .    3.5811680076625634
mr president , commissioners , when this house is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance , if you will , that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue .    3.7416542124230876
the absence of the council , as well as of the majority of meps , shows just how great the divide is between our noble , elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day - to - day policies when it comes to human rights .    3.357701751220335
i believe that , as a beginning , parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the geneva session to narrow that divide . it should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support .    3.9073583914526107
we must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the UNK or abuses are being punished .    3.477602495444985
the role of parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on , particularly at the level of prevention .    4.995022822488828
in that sense , we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law .    3.6538767555469063
it seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed .    3.368085629592515
nowadays , there are many , perhaps too many , treaties on human rights . if those treaties remain mere expressions , they are no more than useless UNK of people ' s thoughts .    4.339085392308075
the time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase , namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis , although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed .    4.163494970903488
i refer to the rome conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 member states of the union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an international criminal court .    3.8696733561427767
in my view , we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally .    4.212503646413184
we have often employed instruments which , at the formal level , make us feel comfortable , but which , in terms of practical results , are totally ineffectual .    4.083294406920712
by that i mean the use , and often abuse , of embargoes during recent years , and the over - cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the european union and third countries , where there have been human rights violations .    4.233913550413193
in particular , we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded .    4.135489001064541
globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process .    3.195774733895649
we should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene , with renewed strength , to safeguard human rights .    3.4296746301668857
in that context i would mention the following : social rights , workers ' rights , quality of work , the need to ensure respect , where necessary , for all the criteria laid down by the international labour organisation , the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled , particularly within the european union .    3.8985072051754517
i would also mention the right to develop . it is the right of all peoples who , in turn , are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that , most importantly , is full of hope and personal growth , within each individual society .    4.051823214351517
all those aspects should be part of a rationale , a discourse and a contribution which the european union should bring to human rights .    3.6646508649599623
i hope that parliament ' s participation in the geneva session turns out to be more than just a token presence and that its representatives do more than just listen to and give evidence . first and foremost they should use the occasion to affirm that we regard the aspects i have just mentioned as central to the identity of the european union and of the european nation , and that we also uphold the principle of the universality of human rights that transcends time and place .    4.11177452718159
that is what we hope for and is the UNK message that we are sending our governments , even if it goes against their interests .    4.516513638138664
mr president , one of the saving features of this parliament is that here we practise a consistent and active human rights policy : the flag flies high , as mrs malmström put it .    3.5889680032934543
at the same time , however , we shut our eyes to the union ' s own problems : to the violence , inequality , and fourth world reality , which is part of everyday life in the eu .    3.7206643357816684
it is absolutely right that we pay serious attention to the violations of human rights that are to be the subject of talks in geneva .    3.9805591234140123
the rhetoric that we use , however , often smacks of UNK , UNK on the sort of UNK we associate with human rights attitudes in north america .    4.501241911268775
it is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non - eu countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum - seekers , whose position is now becoming more difficult in the eu .    3.112277748643013
let us , in particular , focus attention on the re - admission clauses , which present a threat to the geneva convention and which should be blocked .    3.801108868975453
unless we can maintain high standards of human rights with respect to refugees and asylum - seekers , we are not worthy of those european values which make up the european identity , as vaclav havel said here today , and among which he particularly mentioned respect for human rights and solidarity .    3.8203754085135317
i worked for many years on the south african truth and reconciliation commission and it was really moving to see how a nation in such difficult circumstances was reaching out for a more open , european - style , UNK democratic society .    3.680324098006718
i fear that we are now moving in the opposite direction , towards european UNK and apartheid .    3.9788323203265716
mr president , commissioner , mr president - in - office of the council , in my view , the question which needs to be raised in geneva this year is certainly not the death penalty .    3.1230471311204626
we have already had three resolutions on the death penalty approved in geneva .    3.271663058564774
we failed at the general assembly last year on a UNK pretext , i refer to article 2 . 7 , which we are otherwise happy to adopt for all other texts .    4.168554619948815
the question of the death penalty should therefore be raised at this year ' s general assembly , certainly not at the geneva session .    3.7369532558070326
as mr patten said , and i would like to thank him for the positions which he defended , the crucial point is china .    3.3096570566402206
unfortunately , the positions taken by the commission and the council , or at least the presidency , are more than just a hair ' s breadth apart ; this is serious , especially in the light of the council ' s UNK position on austria .    4.026639531633882
in my view , as far as china is concerned , and knowing that the european union ' s policy towards china has been a total failure , UNK constructive dialogue has got us nowhere or , worse , it has given the chinese new UNK for increasing repression and for strengthening religious repression and the repression of freedoms ( as mrs wallström has said with regard to the internet ) in all sectors , in tibet , in inland UNK , in eastern UNK .    3.8160602446900547
there is regression in every sector of chinese civil society .    2.8759432872043984
it is a fact : china is the major threat , the major threat to us , the threat which we must confront , the threat to peace .    4.0008745360927795
it is the UNK of democracy and you know as well as i that the chinese , the chinese leadership , is communist first and chinese second .    3.8462610120667247
china likes UNK .    3.8549361180280584
until we have a firm position , we will achieve nothing with the chinese authorities .    4.288653692044521
i think we need to seize the opportunity .    3.595037892215973
we need to associate ourselves with the american initiative .    3.125780954105368
we need to table a strong text and that text needs to be adopted .    3.581067915723279
we need to work .    3.064318695695018
the fifteen need to start work right now , with all the members of the united nations ; we need , at long last , to issue a firm condemnation and then use that as a basis to gain a negotiating position .    4.048832227434944
mr president , i would like to try to put a different perspective to this .    3.2066243199683497
as you know , on monday an UNK UNK went into UNK around a UNK - shaped asteroid called UNK which is not very far from earth .    3.5655718819839204
UNK show us that there is no life on the asteroid , but much further out in our UNK , the milky way , there are about 300 billion stars , many with planets .    3.9788254798929854
beyond the milky way there are 300 billion other UNK with countless stars and planets .    2.87555282131909
it is probable , therefore , that there is a lot of life out there , and much of it much more advanced than we are .    3.711740089160811
bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the UNK stars , i invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us .    3.064440439843345
what do they see ?    2.9766980994208714
they see a beautiful planet , teeming with life , but they see its atmosphere being polluted and UNK up .    3.266119696519708
they see forests being cut down and UNK spreading .    3.180860417895094
of the living creatures , they can see many animals that are treated UNK , rare ones becoming extinct for ever .    3.049117602915541
how do they see the currently dominant species - that is us ?    3.571649068448343
well , they see the planet ' s resources being unevenly spread .    3.2835914107651267
they see land being fought over , medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted , books for schools - but not at all in the least - developed areas of our world , 50 % of the world ' s population never making a telephone call in their whole life .    3.460810729081353
what do they see about the relationships between human beings ?    2.863094552821385
they see us killing each other .    2.8544177685429615
they see us restricting each other ' s liberties .    2.8740684125454163
they see a never - ending series of local wars . they see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers , or treated as UNK or slaves .    3.0119983998048925
they see unequal treatment of men and women , of people of different ages , of minorities , of people of different coloured UNK , of UNK , of beliefs , of immigrants , even neighbours .    3.4315250566300843
we all know the picture .    3.1381881876762128
the un convention on human rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this .    3.3010580663459996
we should salute it - and i think we do .    4.253753159943304
only in europe are human rights enforceable in law .    3.026375022488296
here in the european parliament some of the members do not want the charter of rights , which is being discussed at the moment , to become enforceable in law .    4.9589952322819055
i say : shame on them !    3.2622506000666722
human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world .    3.618652260844205
that is the goal which we have to work towards .    4.137976036337102
much , as commissioner patten said , remains to be done .    3.1591658266039
mr president , human rights are universal , UNK , interrelated and UNK .    4.12677061686381
this well - known phrase , which is taken from the conclusions of the un world conference on human rights of 1993 , is known off by heart by many .    4.443650919120817
that is positive .    3.19371693955508
but what about the human rights policy within the eu itself ?    3.6700015737749156
does it reflect this vision of coherence ?    3.235984981991747
in fact , does the european union have a human rights policy ?    4.436853957998398
this question does not challenge the efforts made by the member states who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere , for example in china .    3.546038157877481
no , mr president , i am talking about the lack of human rights policy within the european union itself .    4.3016201329728325
a new government has come into power in austria , comprising a political party which has sent out a message of racism and intolerance vis - à - vis minorities .    3.398490883234676
human rights , which the eu embraces , are thus under threat , but the reactions to these events have brought to light the fact that there is no coherent framework in which an appropriate reaction can be formulated .    4.560571335981613
the widely quoted article 7 of the treaty , which provides for the UNK of membership rights from a member state where serious and continuous violations against human rights have been established , is , of course , only a kill or cure remedy , an UNK UNK , which , in the case of austria , can only be quoted in the absence of anything more effective , and by way of warning .    4.068471658827621
there is , therefore a need for a fully - fledged human rights policy for and by the european union , a policy which promotes and UNK human rights within the eu itself .    4.120418866489913
such policy should comprise various components .    3.2594223988645386
firstly : a regulatory framework is needed , which spells out very clearly the rights which the eu intends to secure for its citizens .    3.6247234720449053
a start is now being made on the drafting of such a charter , but we can no longer put off the question of legal status and the strategic significance of this document or pass it on to learned professional jurists .    4.17502431658612
this is a political question which , in the short term , requires an answer from the igc and this parliament .    3.735810862606963
secondly : a range of instruments has to be developed which allow for a flexible response and which do not force us into a situation where we need to choose between a kill or cure remedy or a complete stab in the dark .    3.615634968304232
the following spring to mind in this respect : the systematic UNK of documentation and information , professional forms of observation , the development of information campaigns , the use of cash to support democratic forces in the country concerned , a more creative deployment of the resources which are available through multilateral diplomacy , such as organised dialogue and fact finding missions and such like .    3.656710795484085
thirdly : it will need to be made clear for each of the eu institutions where the responsibility for human rights policy lies within the european union and what the tasks and competences are that this entails .    4.987594389697939
the commission and the council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be .    3.198806763549454
this parliament is excluded from this , for our rules of procedure stipulate that the committee on civil liberties and internal affairs carries this responsibility .    4.006923980781172
but i am somewhat surprised that the resolution which should bring this debate on human rights to a conclusion has been prepared in the foreign sector of this parliament and that the aforementioned committee , of which i form part , has not been involved in this .    4.642887034566647
for the sake of our credibility , we will have to speak with one voice when it comes to human rights and not act as if human rights within the eu are different from human rights elsewhere in the world .    4.007794616797873
i think that this will benefit our credibility in the un human rights committee .    3.181450472616133
mr president , what will it take to make the debate on human rights something other than what it is today : an ideological instrument which helps to UNK peoples rather than free individuals ?    3.7972193181848723
we must start by going beyond man , who is not the master of the universe , to the source of all genuine rights and civilised values , without which the eternal claim to rights always ends in tyranny and UNK .    3.5154862935662603
we need , in the ancient and mediaeval tradition of europe , to go back to the natural order of the universe , i . e . to the creation , and beyond that still further , to the creator ' s intention .    3.957959122102558
then we shall see that the rights of the child are only respected within a proper family , the rights of workers are only respected in the intermediary bodies which we have recently destroyed and that citizens ' rights are only respected within sovereign states .    3.737299626098509
secondly , the doctrine of human rights must no longer be exploited , as it is today , as an instrument of ideological warfare in the hands of a cast which claims the right to decree unilaterally who is to be the arbiter of human rights and who is to be deprived of those rights , thereby denying the legitimacy and , if need be , the freedom of those whom the party line has deemed politically incorrect .    4.22087556771262
' no freedom for the enemies of freedom ' was what the advocates of the UNK terror were saying two centuries ago , the advocates of the revolution which proved , alas , to be the mother of all modern totalitarian regimes .    3.430920222725189
no human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the UNK of the new world order are saying today , the new world order which reigns almost UNK in financial circles , in international institutions , in the media and cultural networks , and in educational institutions , to mention but a few .    4.827099927692145
what is left , for example , of the right of austrians to choose their own destiny , if that choice is dictated on their behalf by those who decide what should or should not be done and if their duly and legally elected leaders are received in an insulting manner , as they were recently by you in portugal , mr president of the council .    3.652935269817271
i do not know if he is still present and can hear me .    2.889861542156625
what is left of the human rights of those who sympathise with the UNK , one of the most important parties in the flemish region , if tomorrow the belgian parliament adopts the UNK , indecent and UNK bill tabled by its main political UNK , the UNK , which seeks quite simply to abolish the party ?    4.017813597279717
what is left of the right to engage in a critical study of history when authors and UNK are persecuted , as the young UNK jean UNK was just yesterday before the court of appeal , in my home town of UNK - he was the subject of an absurd , arrogant and offensive closing speech by the public prosecutor jean - olivier UNK , the UNK expression of UNK thinking and intellectual conformism ?    3.9901862757556152
it is a strange concept of human rights when peaceful patriotism is fraudulently equated with aggressive nationalism , when legitimate protests against immigration policies are equated with i do not know what form of xenophobia and the vital defence of identities is equated with racism .    2.8517813506468
what of the human rights of the millions of french people who voted for the national front and who are deprived of any political representation and UNK daily , as they were on monday on the television channels of the state to which they are required to pay taxes , when the simple expression of justifiably UNK views by one of our colleagues , mr le pen , is used as a pretext for UNK condemnation , in violation of the law and in violation of all UNK of justice , fairness and morals , and when attempts are made , in violation of the clearest legislation , to deprive this representative of millions of our fellow citizens of the mandate which he has been given by their vote , not received as a favour from the government .    3.7593185723905624
in a word , i shall believe your talk about human rights in europe , fellow members , when you acknowledge that your political opponents have the same rights as you allow yourselves .    3.9165915437977303
i shall believe your talk about human rights in china when you name the real cause of the problem , i . e . communism .    3.295244101377981
listen to the UNK voice of UNK in his letter to the americans , in which he says that the main cause of the weakness of western society is excessive pandering to legal individualism , an individualism which , far from allowing people to flourish , paves the way for future dictatorship , in fact the worst kind of dictatorship , because those whom it UNK are not even aware of their terrible UNK .    3.8850992335322134
mr president , the principle of universal human rights is undoubtedly one of the most important political UNK of the 20th century .    4.250110843866069
the holocaust , fifty years ago , led to the need to lay down a number of fundamental rights and freedoms .    4.8967681633613305
since the end of the cold war , compliance with human rights has also become a condition for international cooperation .    3.4176763214771384
leaders violating these principles now face international criticism , sanctions and are even brought to trial , such as ex - dictators like mr pinochet have experienced .    3.3674353973131383
these developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very UNK .    4.638712750985808
especially in situations of war , civilians are given less consideration all the time .    3.257465040813915
it seems contradictory .    3.2162104155264877
never before in history has humanitarian right been so well developed .    3.1076529865753866
never before have so many international treaties been ratified by so many countries .    3.1795287922711495
yet the most basic rules of conduct are being UNK on a massive scale and there are more civilian victims than there were a century ago .    3.854220783998699
women are systematically raped .    3.076095882365067
excesses are no longer the exception , they have unfortunately become the rule .    4.265690270718383
this applies today to no fewer than thirty conflicts worldwide .    2.8986625529467562
too late , too selective and too fragmented : this is how one could describe the human rights policy of the international community .    4.088648985564914
first of all , the policy comes too late .    2.9179719335375736
both in UNK and kosovo , the un , despite the many warnings , appeared to be overtaken by events and stood by as a helpless observer of the massacres , as president havel pointed out this afternoon .    3.3976792794009882
fifty years later , we are still unable to prevent genocide .    4.725705546467625
we should therefore direct more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention as a matter of urgency .    2.9294737626045
control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this .    3.573771051771399
the human rights policy is also too selective .    3.7871919830838237
the months of nato bombardments of kosovo and the mediation attempts in the middle east are in stark contrast to international apathy with regard to the conflicts in africa .    3.508612333884294
the impression that UNK get , namely that they are inferior world citizens , is not UNK .    4.797263436939595
i would like to warn against a UNK of standards in the assessment of human rights situations in africa , where violations are viewed as a necessary evil .    3.7580024487079813
but above all , the human rights policy is too fragmented .    4.079598463126439
we are unable to draft a common strategy within the international communities or europe .    3.183054660484729
take sudan .    3.6601581778363466
the international community is sending conflicting messages to this country .    3.0161655648640053
britain has re - opened its UNK in UNK .    3.458401707613085
canada has invited the UNK for peace talks .    4.121827774421089
europe puts the rebels in the south under pressure to negotiate and at the same time , americans isolate the regime and support the rebels at military level .    3.309319191885
there is a need for more coordination , more exchange of information and a more coherent approach whereby any raised bids are avoided .    3.004442960059491
only then can we follow in the UNK of the UNK of the universal declaration of human rights .    4.131401961851154
mr president , i would like to start with the fact that if words could solve the problems we could all pack up and go home .    3.0634286416985197
but unfortunately , as we speak today in the safety of this chamber , human rights abuses are occurring throughout the free world .    4.387192521343453
sometimes the more we speak , the less we hear - motions : words ; conventions : words ; treaties : words - if we are not careful , words themselves become a substitute for real action .    3.1732206188200855
words framed in inclusive and UNK documents become treaties and conventions which are often UNK as a testimony to a country ' s respect for and adherence to human rights .    3.3331707169172957
yet words spoken , written or signed are not in themselves enough .    3.4699898763079147
look at the signatories to the conventions on human rights and minorities and then compare the treatment received by such minorities , groups and individuals - the list is shameful and UNK .    3.646275623970569
can anyone argue with any UNK that women are treated equally and fairly , that children have human rights or that people are not discriminated against because of their religion , belief , gender , disability , age , sexual orientation , opinion , political affiliation etc ?    3.002643880116529
the UNK of minorities in newspapers and other media fuels discrimination .    3.254872558594242
even within the eu citizens still suffer human rights violations and a breach of our conventions .    3.7137585213194275
every day in the press misinformation and misrepresentation are used to deny some minorities equality before the law and to UNK ethnic minorities .    3.431472731844872
quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created .    3.082823614545547
and so long as people do not have equality before the law , this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded .    3.960813684816097
in our enlargement process in the eu we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities .    4.4784165804434615
we must not waiver in that commitment .    3.0018526139375976
but we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies .    3.0553566613094936
yes , conventions have been signed , but action is needed .    3.1679338980770835
i would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices , eternal vigilance , not just outside our borders but within .    3.6205925993028405
pinochet in chile is as relevant as haider in austria .    3.2078942097279532
human rights and civil liberties are UNK linked .    3.7909213096578074
human rights do not exist in isolation , they are connected to our development policies , our economic policies , our home affairs policies , indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions .    3.763045071546461
i would repeat what mr patten said : we must engage , we must inform , educate and thereby effect real and lasting change .    3.719769313128902
mr president , " europe stands for ideals , values and principles .    2.8206221845757473
we must emphasise europe ' s spiritual history .    3.524009016643963
together , we must re - establish the values which unite europe .    4.205383149520957
spiritual values have been disseminated from europe throughout the globe .    3.143940922598511
we must live with our consciences . "    3.221039241888079
these were the words spoken three hours ago in this chamber by the president of the czech republic , vaclav havel .    3.138930066384965
in an extraordinarily UNK speech , characterised by wisdom , historical knowledge , an understanding of the human heart and insight into europe ' s spiritual and christian heritage , he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity .    3.210072338875383
we should be grateful that there are heads of state like vaclav havel in our europe .    3.8621316572284066
first of all , civil society .    2.761650332635268
vaclav havel stated that , in eastern europe , the communist regimes UNK destroyed civil society : national movements , churches and the independent trade unions .    3.5960603592914704
the same is happening in china in connection with the falun gong movement and with the catholic and protestant churches .    3.417620245170853
it is happening with UNK in tibet .    3.582167854971655
we must never forget to defend civil society .    2.935059787462873
i also want to mention the death penalty .    2.6333041071675187
like my own country , sweden , the eu bases its view of human beings upon the equal , unique and UNK value of every human .    3.4178504759478425
on the basis of this principle , human beings should always have the chance to UNK themselves .    3.6860806471471337
try telling that to the governments of the united states , russia and china .    4.095882389539101
mr president , president - in - office , commissioner , i believe the approach of eu member states at geneva should be to prioritise the situations in kosovo , mexico , UNK UNK , sierra UNK and china .    3.8472888883530847
in relation to china , we should not be UNK from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked .    4.074319196088193
however , it is imperative that the eu speaks and acts as one , and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve .    3.386415174806326
however , if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at geneva , then the office of the high commissioner for human rights must be provided with the necessary resources .    4.738909856336057
the financial resources of the united nations are spread very UNK and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat .    3.6631339841970747
resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights , strategic planning , the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the united nations .    3.8286949345222347
to this end the high commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for usd 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks .    3.1889927167396146
the european union and its member states should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds .    3.1755456557043686
in so doing , we would not only UNK the united states into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to un funding , but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric .    4.403166809807959
mr president , this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual un human rights convention and the commission ' s and council ' s efforts in this respect .    4.167282282453022
i would first of all like to say that i am very pleased with the contributions made by mr patten and the minister , and i welcome the fact that both china and cuba are on the agenda .    4.005939075371618
cuba is the last UNK of dictatorship in south america and we must be mindful of this , with all due sympathy to cuba .    4.48178270804061
it is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy .    3.0344683782365856
i would , during my two minutes , like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart .    3.3266631665623736
the first country is indonesia .    3.1229815240653096
we are naturally delighted that indonesia is under new rule and that mr wahid and mrs UNK are the new president and vice - president .    3.44011040711709
we are also pleased that the situation in timor is slowly moving in the right direction .    3.0241188858842802
but i can report that in the moluccas , an area just north of timor , the violence is still not under control .    3.8702880846167376
this has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years .    3.261128013210813
tens of thousands of people are on the run .    4.056285293896573
the situation is badly managed .    3.210175519576401
i know that tomorrow , or the day after tomorrow , an important programme will be shown on dutch television , in which an appeal will be made for observers . this is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on , so that at least a record can be made , not least for the future , for human rights committees , of what has been happening .    4.703630547819222
my urgent request , which has been echoed many times in resolutions , is the following : could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the moluccas ?    3.810340835460741
surely thousands of people killed , thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough .    3.2254171010700516
my second country - i will be brief as mr patten knows this country very well - is burma .    3.8149034250835254
surely we cannot just keep silent about burma .    2.786323897026826
i have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion .    2.7242565878439735
for ten years now , the elected president of that country has been under house arrest .    3.4748599158528366
and for ten years now , its parliament has been out of action .    3.6819914062274792
numerous mps have been killed or have UNK the country and only a few are left in burma .    3.862414361939136
there are hundreds of thousands of refugees in UNK and india from burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention .    3.750431546906308
in my opinion , burma should be put back on the agenda , too , certainly in the wake of indonesia ' s u - turn .    3.5554031586980517
surely we cannot tolerate the fact that mrs UNK san UNK UNK feels completely left in the UNK , even by europe .    4.1869971057318125
my request is , in fact , to put this country back on the top of the agenda .    3.858630524732159
mr president , mr president - in - office , commissioner , economic UNK cannot be the only factor that determines the european union ' s status in the world .    3.361142355249212
one of the eu ' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights , as exercised both within the union and by our partners .    4.034386898164463
the european parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights , and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self - interest and " national interests " , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the member states and even by other european union institutions .    3.8977476075763016
we can therefore safely say , for example , that the european parliament has never allowed the situation in east timor to be forgotten , which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people , who always opposed occupation by indonesia .    3.836700407524289
by the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to indonesia , a stance that the council unfortunately did not take into account .    3.3515090772247675
but it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to UNK instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position .    2.9907675678654497
it is vital that when violations are committed , the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity , whoever or wherever they may be - in indonesia or angola , in cuba , china or burma , whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers , humble foot - soldier or general or even a minister .    3.197082827459421
justice needs to be done in indonesia .    3.757843829938612
justice needs to be done in east timor .    3.7089522334900273
president wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with .    3.287375546074824
the specific reference in this resolution to east timor , on the initiative of the ppe group , is a timely one .    4.342811780068545
someone must be held to account for the events that took place there , some of which i saw with my own eyes as a representative of this house ; they cannot go UNK .    4.104573642258707
it is impossible to talk about east timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of timorese refugees living on indonesian soil in UNK conditions , under the control of indonesian soldiers and militias , and being used as bargaining chips .    3.181565291328776
this is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency .    2.801929020207122
.    2.4274255028413507
( pt ) mr president , i would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the council presidency , and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen member states are to approve in the council . our experience of previous sessions of the human rights commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the european union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the commission , and it is important to maintain this .    3.9077329196149297
i would also like to say that the european parliament ' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent european union positions on various different issues , and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented .    3.8183556060250687
i would also like to stress , as many members have highlighted , that human rights policy is at the heart of europe ' s identity and that respect for human rights should be seen as a fundamental principle for international cooperation by the european union .    3.669982973733042
hence the need for the most coherent european human rights policy possible , which of course means that we need to adopt clear and unambiguous positions where we consider a state of affairs to be unacceptable , and i have in mind , in particular , the references that many members have made to china .    4.414298545691048
but we have also duly noted the concerns expressed by many other members about other countries , notably indonesia , east timor , the moluccas and burma .    3.354524759818806
i could not conclude without mentioning mr van hecke ' s speech in particular , in which he referred to the human rights situation in africa and to the role and priorities of the portuguese presidency , and questioned the sincerity of the priority we are giving to relations with the european union .    3.891837942908348
i would simply like to say that the portuguese presidency has , in these two short months , organised the first development council , admittedly an informal one , whose agenda was rightly dominated by eu - africa relations . indeed it was this subject which led the development ministers of the fifteen member states to meet in lisbon for discussions specifically on the new era these relations have entered .    3.5683037285138144
furthermore , i cannot stress enough the significance of our having concluded important negotiations on the new convention to succeed the lomé convention , and the fact that , following extremely complex and difficult negotiations , we have succeeded in organising - or making preparations for the organisation of - the first eu - africa summit .    4.234519429683165
for all these reasons i thought it essential to reply directly to mr van hecke ' s question on this issue .    3.040326984257983
. mr president , this has been a very useful debate .    3.9463174485028047
one or two speeches have referred to specific issues which we are well advised to think about very carefully .    4.181421545130546
for example , mrs maij - weggen referred to both indonesia and burma and made some important points about both those countries and the human rights situation there .    3.2113843467814664
what i would like to focus on very briefly are one or two themes which ran through our debate .    3.5206444680092748
one of the very first speakers , mr UNK , spoke of the remarks made earlier today by mr havel .    3.8261651466730986
it was a remarkable speech and i hope that mr gollnisch , who is no longer able to be with us , was able to hear that speech as well .    4.234416961098047
i also hope that , if there is any life in outer space , as has been speculated by mr newton dunn , it was tuned in to mr havel ' s speech as well .    3.904445697522015
mr havel reminded us that the union is not just about markets , about gdp growth , it is a union of values that is reflected in the treaties and is reflected in our obligations in the whole area of external assistance , reflected quite specifically in what we are charged to do .    4.404918227733577
how do we implement what the treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes ?    3.208968009802421
one or two honourable members , mr UNK and mr UNK , spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality .    3.233965310868307
mr UNK said , which is right in a sense , that words are no substitute for real action .    3.702181587265633
of course , words can make a bit of a difference , a point that was made by mrs malmström .    4.029633334963318
she said that she had received a letter from the chinese ambassador , a very UNK and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country , to tell her that she was wrong and the european parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in china .    3.7533430942440544
i think after her speech she will receive a UNK of letters from the chinese authorities .    3.3988498551472572
she will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in china .    3.7689255874849863
i think she was reflecting the views of many non - governmental organisations , many people who admire chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in china today .    3.3735115600480654
of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action , and the very first speech by mr salafranca mentioned two issues apart from geneva which represent actions , one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the european parliament on behalf of the european taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about eur 100 million that is spent through programmes , for which i am responsible , mainly going to non - governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation .    4.495511536193849
we will want to share with parliament , as UNK say , our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead .    3.3180416983921135
there is also the question which was referred to by mr salafranca , who i am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate .    3.346260560473049
there is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy .    4.184983183684915
i want to remind parliament that the commission will be publishing , before the middle of the year , a comprehensive , intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy .    3.5960095143891913
it is immensely important , and if i had not thought that already , having listened to the remarkable speech by mr havel earlier in the day i would have certainly come to that conclusion .    3.7672300147988755
it has been a useful debate .    3.1886182423794707
i hope we can have further debates like this .    2.836140421789971
i hope we can have , in particular , debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters , where people are still being tortured , where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this house takes for granted , as i do .    4.018192924980584
i have received 7 motions for resolution , pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) , to close the present statement .    2.3945000146462965
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place on thursday .    1.945412249527279
cyprus and malta    4.41635291691028
the next item is the joint debate on :    1.968923672811476
the council statement on the position of the european union on developments concerning cyprus ;    3.9993306551825665
the report ( a4 - 0029 / 2000 ) by mr brok , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the proposal for a council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta [ com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0308 / 1999 - 1999 / 0199 ( cns ) ] .    2.0503786466087424
mr seixas da costa has the floor on behalf of the council .    2.929534680602553
i think it will be obvious to everyone that the events in helsinki at the end of last year and the new era in relations between the european union and turkey have created a new UNK , at community level , which we cannot ignore when it comes to relations between the two cypriot communities .    4.101725144699845
at the beginning of december 1999 , the first round of negotiations were held in new york , after an interruption of several years in negotiations between the cypriot communities in the north and south of the island .    3.6225799029484484
these negotiations took the form of indirect discussions UNK by the un special representative , álvaro de UNK .    3.667785939750756
there is a possibility , which has not yet been absolutely confirmed , that continuous and direct discussions may take place , with work continuing until september this year .    3.4552335746575116
these discussions essentially cover four areas : security , the structure of government , territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation , as a result of the situation following the partition of the island .    3.54318709756505
however , agreement has also been reached on the possibility of including other issues , and the representative of the northern part of the island , UNK UNK , has suggested three new topics : sovereignty , confidence - building measures and the issue of lifting the embargo on products from the north of the island .    3.9201462427746065
the discussions held so far have essentially resulted in two developments . the first is the possibility of opening up a direct information channel between the european union and the north of the island , without this necessarily UNK recognition of this part of the island as a legal personality at international level , but as a means of facilitating adoption of the acquis communautaire with a view to eventual accession of the whole island , if a solution can , in the meantime , be found to the broader problem of the partition of the island .    3.8113595191705607
the second development which we regard as important is the statement made by the secretary - general of the united nations at the end of the first day ' s discussions to the effect that an overall settlement of the situation would involve recognition of the specific situation of the north of the island .    3.9385197470821347
this is the position of the secretary - general of the united nations and it will therefore have to form part of our future analysis .    3.549432377944455
certain expectations exist about the third round of negotiations , in view of the proposed scenarios being prepared with the involvement of representatives of the united states and the united kingdom , in particular in the areas of security and the constitutional structure , which it is envisaged will be presented at this round through the good offices of the representative of the secretary - general of the united nations .    3.8632307506902865
this will take place after the election in the north of the island scheduled for 18 april .    3.4514070828121377
furthermore , the portuguese presidency of the european union has decided , following the example of previous presidencies , to appoint a representative to establish contacts with the various parties involved in this issue .    4.1652648936890495
this representative has already contacted all these parties and has , in close cooperation with the representative of the secretary - general of the united nations , been monitoring and assisting with the work of the various rounds .    3.635236472719462
the approach that we have been following in these discussions , and our participation in them , essentially turns on taking advantage of a certain desire to alleviate the tensions that exist , based on a conviction - which appears to be widely shared - that it is necessary to continue to negotiate , and that continuing negotiations and maintaining their impetus also give rise to hopes that a definitive solution can be found .    3.8723387771051443
there is also another important aspect which i referred to at the beginning of my statement , and this relates to turkey ' s role in helping the north of the island to prepare for accession .    3.896088386013614
i was able to talk to prime minister UNK ecevit about this issue when i visited ankara myself , and although we are aware of the difficulties and sensitivity associated with turkey ' s particular approach to this question , i believe that there is a window of opportunity that we must not miss .    4.050370588343823
this window of opportunity involves combining various factors , one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between turkey and the european union .    3.94785908420772
this is key as regards the future of this issue .    4.182156126027129
on the other hand , we think it is important - and this is also linked with the way in which the european union relates to the heart of this matter - that an exchange of information between the commission and the cypriots in the north of the island should be encouraged . this would not , let me make this quite clear , imply any kind of formal recognition .    4.17034281548474
nevertheless , we believe , and i think this is also how the commission sees things , that the whole process of approximation with the acquis communautaire with a view to overall integration of the island in the european union through accession at some point in the future implies involving the communities in the north of the island as soon as possible . it may also give the european union access to data enabling it to justify accession , as part of its efforts to assess accession conditions .    4.504870113997348
furthermore , this means that we in the council - and i think that parliament will join us in this - should encourage the commission ' s involvement in this undertaking .    4.936885235406128
it is essential for us to send the commission a message of confidence about its role in this area .    3.6681034916033592
lastly , i believe - and this is also the presidency ' s intention - that we should continue to cooperate actively with the united nations , given the UNK , intelligent and capable way in which the secretary - general , and the un organisation in general , have conducted these discussions , and in particular the way they have endeavoured to help to harmonise the two parties ' positions .    4.919639623094919
the nicosia government has expressed its satisfaction with the helsinki conclusions , which open up the way to accession to the european union without solving the partition of the island beforehand .    3.626523915350276
nevertheless , i have to say that the same authorities have expressed their concern about the pressure they may come under to resolve the issues raised by partition , which will evidently imply some concessions .    3.7229148497823616
this is related to developments in the sphere of displaced people and the possibility of a new arrangement regarding displaced people should a different solution be found for the island .    3.7011226202378267
on the other hand , the turkish cypriots fear - and there is no point in trying to conceal this - that turkey ' s application for membership of the european union may lead to greater flexibility in ankara ' s position on this .    3.6750026576711328
i believe that , despite the fears that may be felt by the two communities on the island , these points , which could be viewed in a negative light by the authorities on both sides , may in the end justify hopes of an ultimate solution .    3.8258425978140473
it is very clear that this solution will involve one of the most important aspects of relations in this area at present , which is the extremely positive trend in relations between UNK and ankara and the very important part played in these relations by the greek foreign minister , UNK UNK , and the turkish foreign minister , UNK UNK .    4.1688749525741144
we believe that this has created the framework for a positive outcome .    3.6776221031828253
as far as we , the council presidency , are concerned , we will continue to follow these developments very closely , and we will certainly cooperate with the secretary - general and his personal representative on this matter .    4.688009431649867
we will make the community institutions aware of what we are able to do , and what is possible in general , as regards coordination , not just at political level but also as regards what the commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process .    4.601452830650568
in particular , we will make known the flexibility that both parties have demonstrated on this issue .    3.572072050130965
mr president , we have listened to the statements by the council and the commission and i would like to make the following observations .    3.811678252991044
mr president - in - office of the council , i appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the turkish cypriot side , but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one UNK that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition , even though you stressed that this is not the case .    3.3029776229525987
for example , i would not refer to the government of nicosia .    4.121153544043473
it is the cypriot government , mr president - in - office , not the government of nicosia .    3.422502077269296
that government has proposed a way in which the turkish cypriot side can take part , and i think it would be right for the council and the commission to urge the turkish cypriot side to take part UNK in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the republic of cyprus .    4.948624372573835
on the other hand , the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre - accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us .    3.4430686772093644
i cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently , nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies .    2.910336941955465
nor can i understand the pressure applied by parliament to include the funds in chapter 7 for the pre - accession strategy . how can the whole of the european union treat , in this way , two small countries situated on its periphery ?    4.012572324559452
not only are they countries which the european union needs , but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union .    3.9885527420718616
as the commissioner said , and i agree with him , it is a matter of political decision .    5.1000776993838235
this is a small political decision which would bring major benefits , especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state , to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the republic of cyprus , genuinely , to be rid of occupying forces .    3.998810938689923
mr president , we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta .    2.5875346440863787
this proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and , once it is implemented , will replace the financial protocols which have now expired .    3.6002502804349725
pre - accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the community acquis .    4.314821019064789
the commission ' s analysis has in fact shown that , although classified as high income countries by the world bank , cyprus and malta have the same difficulties as the UNK in transposing community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity .    3.6107850193008457
it was pointed out , during the discussion of mr brok ' s excellent report in committee , that both countries can also benefit from the meda budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest .    3.8182764840393872
i would be grateful if the commissioner could explicitly confirm that .    2.3258100141158295
as far as cyprus is concerned , part of the technical and financial aid provided for in the instruments will be used to bring the greek and turkish communities closer together and solve the problem of the partition of the island once and for all .    3.383034746418185
the declarations made on the cyprus question by the council and the commission were therefore most opportune and i should like to thank the president of the council and commissioner verheugen .    4.256669871399381
since 4 july 1990 , when cyprus applied to join the eu , the european parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the security council of the united nations .    4.063680786116844
in other words , accession should not be held hostage to a political solution .    3.423338863623228
the two processes are separate processes .    3.0479343578971774
this unequivocal position on the part of the european parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy .    4.4941474752993305
we must therefore welcome the fact that the helsinki european council put an end to the speculation and stated in its conclusions , and i quote , that " if no settlement has been reached by the completion of accession negotiations , the council ' s decision on accession will be made without the above being a precondition " .    3.566310271189533
the position is clear and we must now hope that the improved climate surrounding relations between the european union and turkey and between greece and turkey will bear favourably on the turkish cypriot community and that it will withdraw its refusal to send representatives to the accession negotiations .    4.025488822768352
the presence of these representatives will not prejudge the final political solution in any way whatsoever .    3.503209922108768
on the contrary , it will allow the interests of all concerned to be highlighted as and when cyprus joins the european union and prepares for a turning point in its history .    3.8001463235435624
however , i also think that we in the eu should be making a constructive contribution .    4.295695508816706
i also think - as has already been mentioned - that there are certain problems with the financing arrangements , which we must solve .    4.168161035615153
there is , of course , the question of pre - accession aid , and this belongs in category seven .    4.007062976111575
last year , parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four , and the two applicant states are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant states from central and eastern europe , as they , in fact , should be , according to the declarations from the helsinki summit .    4.278962490155834
resources should therefore be set aside from category seven , where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out .    3.7770808289539928
this is the crux of the matter .    2.272091801716281
the main point is that the money for cyprus ' s and malta ' s pre - accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for , if the council does not endorse this view , it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in helsinki in december .    4.137116165256544
the most important thing is that a multi - annual programme be guaranteed , and in the correct category , so that it might be possible to begin making plans where cyprus and malta are concerned .    3.8126106871494714
we should continue to exert strong pressure on the government of cyprus , but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority . besides , we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is .    4.5595344916875895
it is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full .    3.009324885383592
but we are also convinced that , despite improved relations between the turkish and greek populations , it is not enough .    4.035301036698219
the conflict in cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future .    3.5190231354680193
the european union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support , although that is important , by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence - building programmes .    3.3186222983381963
i must say that UNK UNK ' s presence here in the european parliament is sadly missed . his efforts to build peace should serve as an example , to all of us , on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved .    3.8890290119267803
mr president , the reference to dialogue between the two cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNK reminds us of the fact that , 26 years after the UNK of the island by the turkish army , nearly 40 % of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers , heavy UNK is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present , in total violation of the resolutions by the security council of the united nations on this matter .    3.5571483073466115
what can the european union do , without interfering in internal affairs in cyprus , to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the european community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the union within the next few years ?    4.550600562398773
i have listened to the somewhat UNK talk and UNK on the part of the council which , in my view , need clarifying .    3.798443960157753
i think that we need , first and foremost , to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind , i . e . the resolutions of the united nations .    3.5402085476449523
the security council feels that the solution to the cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two - zone , twin - community federation , in other words a single state , as mr verheugen mentioned , consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities .    3.4529721510465134
cyprus should be one sovereign state , with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be UNK .    3.6733936345345004
the international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force .    2.924403902821204
secondly , the european union stands to gain , in my view , by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the helsinki european council .    3.740775426056507
the solution to the cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to cyprus ' s accession to the union , as mr poos has reminded us .    3.519048608583274
if it were , turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of cyprus to the european union , which is , of course , unacceptable .    3.6677080196315353
thirdly , we must not , in turn , allow the position taken by the helsinki european council to UNK our efforts to resolve the cypriot question before cyprus joins the union .    3.873600497915049
from this point of view , the other decision taken at helsinki , namely to grant turkey candidate status , gives the fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with ankara can and , in my view , should , include a determination to ensure that turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united cyprus and peace in the eastern mediterranean .    3.73481194769796
mr president , there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to cyprus and malta is important .    3.4172849044613507
the big question , however , is from what budget heading should this aid be financed ?    3.8077238175188257
the council and commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4 .    3.09116283884157
this is in line with the budget order issued by parliament in december last .    3.4299754464870547
the rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes UNK cyprus and malta under category 7 .    3.57883346274195
the committee on budgetary control has even suggested postponing approval of the brok report until the council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7 .    3.114913596287141
this is an extremely risky strategy .    2.8926579976890574
in fact , the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in parliament .    3.345190703018723
cyprus and malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the council and parliament regarding the height of the ceilings .    3.699975609117828
i would therefore advocate that the eur 15 million in category 4 be dropped , in line with the commission ' s proposal .    2.9424589725172345
a multiannual budget of the commission later on in the year , may give a decisive answer regarding credits for the coming years .    4.2036313790748565
mr president , all over the world work is being done to resolve long - standing conflicts and bring together communities divided by history and by old tribal UNK and hatreds .    2.9607154104240445
now is the time to devote our time and energy to UNK cypriots from both sides of the " green line " in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long .    3.1489083580261528
we all know that special care is needed to ensure that cyprus is brought successfully into the european union , and the decisions taken at helsinki give an added dimension to this debate , with the acceptance of turkey as a candidate country .    3.884975957711518
i hope that the decisions taken at helsinki lead to progress on the cyprus issue .    2.873413913079189
i hope this signals a new era of hope for cyprus .    3.178610655217921
i hope that turkey begins to play a constructive role in the cyprus issue .    3.156445624386535
i am delighted to hear the words of support from the council and the commission for the un and the work it is doing in encouraging proximity talks between the two communities to encourage reconciliation and the rebuilding of trust between the two communities in cyprus .    3.5321363238364825
i very much welcome the commission ' s support for that UNK , UNK , federal cyprus for which the un has campaigned for so long and which both the greek cypriot side and the turkish cypriot side should be working hard to bring about .    3.555108534488111
i welcome the renewed warmth in relations between the greek government and the turkish government .    3.7521138731512327
i hope that has an encouraging effect on the cyprus talks .    3.6265027653716833
i hope that the accession money available to assist cyprus is used partly to promote that reconciliation and rebuilding of trust and that both sides of the divided communities in cyprus accept and use that money in the spirit in which it is given .    3.4138207716758697
we all , throughout the european institutions - in parliament , the council and the commission - should be doing our best to aid cyprus in its quest to reach a peaceful solution which brings together these two communities which have been divided for too many years .    4.271544551923074
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner verheugen , the regulation on accession aid is not exactly an UNK for coherent work on the part of the commission .    2.889566054132482
rather , the way in which these aid measures have been UNK together smacks of UNK to me .    4.415439111269522
this applies both in terms of the substance and the financial aspect .    3.708955766088778
in my view , it will hardly enable us to present the accession activities conducted by the union to the citizens of cyprus and malta as evidence of the fact that it is worth their while joining .    4.475433712274179
as vaclav havel rightly said today , the european union will be judged on its political qualities according to what it can do for the individual .    3.889002683801368
as far as the citizens are concerned , it is what a regulation can do for them that matters .    4.346261048801537
we will not exactly win any awards with this regulation as far as that is concerned .    3.191998903619982
it is UNK and contains UNK paragraphs , which is no way to set a UNK example .    4.223594967357459
the quality of an aid package is assessed according to the following criteria : is it decentralised , is it transparent , is it accessible to the citizens and does it work ?    3.9714367645163393
nonetheless , as far as the divided island of cyprus is concerned , overall , this pre - accession strategy is bound up with a major political challenge .    3.8332896967316796
in my view , it is the task of the european union to employ all instruments , including this one , so as to contribute towards resolving the conflict on the island by political means .    3.830258243872828
i must take this opportunity to say that it is precisely the amendment submitted by the european parliament that is so important to me in this respect .    4.615438634615275
both the commission and the council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well .    3.419914032764501
i am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect .    3.5724806653168626
i believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in cyprus before admitting this country to the european union .    3.3927740030620788
mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner , the view of the greek communist party is that the main problem of cyprus is not its accession to the european union but the occupation of 40 % of its territory by turkey , which has continued for 26 years .    3.9200180798269866
regardless of the national origin of each cypriot , the future of the cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country .    3.603414834500268
the only acceptable solution that guarantees the future , that leaves no room for foreign interventions , like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years , is a unified and federal cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the un ' s security council .    4.093587432187099
the key to solving the cyprus problem is in the hands of the turkish government , which supports and encourages the intransigence of the turkish cypriot leader UNK UNK .    3.3293650764404994
for its part , the european union , with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights , has never been moved by the UNK of the cypriot people , by the problem of greek and turkish cypriot refugees , by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of cyprus , or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by turkey in the occupied areas .    4.080184370415335
even in this chamber , the council ' s representative referred to the north of cyprus and not to the occupied territories .    4.319433346425705
the recent helsinki decision to grant turkey accession country status , even though it has made not the slightest UNK over the issue of its occupation of cyprus , for example , by reducing its military presence there or giving back UNK , is clearly encouraging turkey ' s intransigence .    3.698281124388934
it is not by chance that , immediately after helsinki , the turkish prime minister , UNK ecevit , stated that the cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974 .    3.151842343521979
encouraging turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the un secretary general .    3.9656521147920403
on their course towards accession , the people of cyprus have already lost a great deal , but stand to lose even more .    4.001424458007981
the application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the cypriot economy , especially in agriculture . it entails the liquidation of the public sector , and it UNK and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in cyprus .    3.672149557286901
mr president , i beg your pardon , but the french interpreter made a small error , on the most sensitive word in the debate , during the translation of what mr alyssandrakis just said .    4.225383929768562
i just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity .    3.5206635102491917
mr alyssandrakis was translated as saying " the UNK solution would be best " .    2.841379983461081
obviously , he said " the federal solution would be best " .    2.853782254362512
it is a most important point and needs to be clarified , mr president .    3.937661304063568
thank you very much for the clarification mr wurtz .    2.552925122495514
mr president , malta and cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland europe .    3.4381007580237264
the maltese in particular have been very good at UNK in hostile geographical and geopolitical UNK .    3.4235896225652547
their success has relied in great part on their enterprise , their dynamism and their flexibility .    3.0027376485806365
malta has UNK light and heavy industry , growing financial services , good agriculture , magnificent tourism and an UNK range of employment opportunities , all of this on an island virtually UNK of natural resources .    3.45773697244569
i am certain , therefore , that an island such as malta , with its population of UNK 000 cannot accommodate the UNK of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater .    4.095539017144633
thus , when i look at this proposed instrument i do not see a measure to bring two peoples into the UNK of mother europe .    3.949501466946512
the situation is more akin to a black hole in space , UNK in masses so UNK that not even light escapes .    3.166800772901723
we should not be UNK these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction , giving them money to absorb laws which are as UNK to their culture as a black hole is to mother earth .    3.375517439372585
the eu should leave cyprus and malta alone .    3.189792698365308
it seems to me that the only people in malta that want this are the political class , and i shall be keeping my fingers crossed that once again the maltese people are the winners .    3.1994719932079563
mr president , this is one of the few occasions when , from what the speakers have said in this parliament , from all sides of the house , there is clearly the greatest convergence of views on the cyprus issue and , of course , on the pre - accession process for cyprus and malta .    3.891771815982179
this means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the cyprus problem .    3.788047458672391
at the same time , however , it means that both the council and the commission have a very strong mandate , so that the strength of opinion expressed by all the european parties , and all the peoples , can empower their political ability to address the problem .    4.19803171167756
helsinki was an historic event , an historic turning - point and an historic new reference point .    3.3925822195705084
if , for any reason , the balance achieved there should be considered by some to be a point of departure for new negotiations anywhere else , if some people destabilise this totality of facts and equilibrium by their attitude , they will be making a tragic mistake .    4.023318489001418
conditions are ripe .    4.046787426163907
what is needed from the european commission , the council and everyone else , is a quiet determination , a quiet determination to continue the accession negotiations on both cyprus and malta without UNK , granted that in the last analysis they are the most mature of all the countries seeking accession , so that this determination can act as a signal to anyone whose view may differ from the view we all agree about .    4.348843603257181
in any event , the outcome is in your hands .    2.730030514028419
the outcome is in our hands to the extent that we are providing you with decisions , to the extent that we are providing you with options .    3.3981589522770155
now , as regards the brok report , cyprus and malta are the last of the mediterranean islands , and , unless i am mistaken , the last islands anywhere in europe which have not UNK to the european union .    4.096438272032988
this has a certain UNK value because the mediterranean and its islands - and i too come from an island - are the area which most of those who come from northern europe for their summer holidays get to see , as well as the people who live there .    3.9627464450178316
from that standpoint , UNK ' s island , as cyprus is known , and the pirates ' island , as we UNK say of malta with great UNK , are two jewels which should be welcomed into the european union without delay .    4.293279531745742
they have healthy economies , high - level economic relations , and in the final analysis they constitute a testing ground for the european union ' s political will .    4.138271412437913
in conclusion , since i do not think i need to say much , given the unanimity that exists here , i just want to make one brief remark to the president - in - office . i think that there are some peculiarities in his position .    4.519526927251142
i hope there has been an interpretation error , and that he will clarify the matter in his follow - up speech .    4.200020976526163
. ( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i have listened to your comments very carefully , and in particular to the rather emotional comments about cyprus , especially in defence of the present legal situation in cyprus , which the european union specifically acknowledges by recognising the relevant resolutions of the united nations security council .    3.6372677384877545
mr wurtz , in no way can it be said that the council is maintaining an ambiguous silence about this issue : the council assumes total responsibility for its interpretation of the situation in cyprus .    4.290299465528895
moreover , it was this situation and this interpretation which led the council to take the decision it took in luxembourg at the end of 1997 , when it decided to take the first steps in the accession process for the republic of cyprus to join the european union .    4.311144908218519
i hope that honourable members will realise that , regardless of the more or less emotional statements made about issues of this kind , the day - to - day reality of international negotiations normally forces governments to adopt a somewhat more flexible stance - and when i say governments i mean all governments .    3.388026339834265
in fact we need more emotional statements to remind us that all these issues have a human side .    3.997534753643293
but we also need to be aware that it is by virtue of rational political UNK , and flexibility in negotiations , that we are able to find solutions to the major disputes which have ultimately led to many tragedies in history .    4.227643133978988
regardless of who is to blame - and we are not here to apportion blame , the relevant united nations resolutions in this area are clear enough - i believe that we should take advantage of the opportunities that the new situation is opening up , in more of a rational way and less of an emotional one .    4.277287396095343
the european council in helsinki had the courage to take certain decisions , and i believe that various aspects of these decisions have already recognised the real value of these opportunities which , as i said at the beginning of my first speech , represent a window of opportunity .    3.7799750346228818
we will not achieve concrete results during this stage of negotiations , which is a delicate and sensitive phase , by exploiting tensions .    3.4461325206050324
no , we should continue to make progress by working UNK to support the special representative of the secretary - general of the united nations with his remit .    3.7209058161549597
the european union ' s position on this is crystal clear , and i do not think it is worthwhile second - guessing particular phrases in the council ' s conclusions or in any other statement .    3.7940382212762724
we do not play at political correctness in this house : we are concerned with fairness at international level and with concrete statements on this issue consistently defined by the council over a period of time , and which the european commission has also followed carefully , attentively and UNK .    4.506621548528423
so when we talk now about the need to involve the northern cyprus community in exchanges of information , particularly with a view to the eventual accession of the republic of cyprus to the european union , we need to be aware that we are trying to find practical formulas that will enable us to overcome the obstacles standing in the way of a political solution .    3.9018045100323766
we are not trying to deceive anyone and we are in no way trying to use practical solutions to create a model UNK political recognition .    3.648553727228841
i believe that , over time , the council of the european union has clearly demonstrated that this is not how it sees this issue .    5.051331405362598
decisions have been taken by the council with a great sense of responsibility .    4.0496577170081896
we believe that helsinki was very clear in this respect .    3.322079396921137
the authorities of the republic of cyprus itself have clearly recognised that our relations with them regarding their accession to the european union have been positive .    3.615157732971049
there is no point in second - guessing or trying to second - UNK our intentions .    2.8212040195828796
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate , which all in all i have found to be encouraging and supportive , and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this house for the policy of the member states and that of the commission .    4.100521176509962
however , i would be more than pleased to UNK a few points as requested .    4.032238184053013
i will turn firstly to matters pertaining to headings 4 and 7 . it is quite simple : a special heading , namely , the famous heading 7 , was created in berlin , as part of the large agenda 2000 package , for the applicant countries of eastern and central europe , which are currently undergoing a process of transformation , and for these countries alone .    4.183776206507046
malta , cyprus and turkey were not provided for at this stage .    3.3987972615401065
mrs schroedter described this as a lack of coherence .    3.688693020829995
she ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile president - in - office of the council , who is not exactly a stranger to you , how this presumed lack of coherence has come about .    3.4150701201008644
i have had a little to do with this too .    4.212632953191647
i do not believe this to be the case . the reason for this decision was , rather , that we wanted to have a special instrument for the eastern and central european states which , like malta and cyprus , are involved in the accession process , but under different conditions .    3.9759850583640843
nevertheless , i have said that i understand the arguments that people have been putting forward here and the commission will endeavour to take account of these aspirations , but since this is all about agenda 2000 and the financial perspective , we will not be able to do this without amending this financial perspective .    4.965233036808898
hitherto this has been out of the question of course .    4.853004918940881
by way of clarification : if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget .    3.4627673515802426
if we do this , then heading 7 would be increased accordingly but heading 4 would be decreased by the same amount .    3.4764926719426876
the idea that heading 7 could be added to in this way and heading 4 left alone , is not workable .    4.1497353271365265
parliament is no more able than anyone else to spend money that it has not got , at least not until we have a printing machine installed in the UNK that we can use to UNK euro notes !    4.691664117991724
as for the peace process in cyprus and how it is linked with the accession negotiations , i would reiterate that there has always been a direct connection between the two .    4.136685489814583
the commission and the council have long endeavoured to encourage the two communities in cyprus to undertake joint projects .    3.034806464225901
so far , as you know , this has proved unsuccessful , and i have been asked if there have been any signs to the contrary .    4.29720014643121
mrs rothe , i would put it this way : i am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind .    4.5118719801734155
i do not have confirmation of this at present , and nor do i expect it , since we have not yet held direct talks .    3.8762247898847826
these will take place at a later date .    3.2967439469404467
the framework conditions have changed in that the helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto , and , above all , in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition .    4.03355145887981
i have always believed that the old line - i . e . not to admit cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the turkish community on cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves , for , with this strategy , the turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait .    3.778327912091315
there would then be no question of cyprus acceding to the union .    3.6042695678041468
as matters stand , turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of cyprus being integrated into the european union , and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the greek community whilst the turkish community , whose level of prosperity is already far lower , would fall even further behind .    3.680692762130429
therefore , it is my firm belief that , since helsinki , there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict .    4.323517169098645
indeed that was the idea behind it .    3.777018351226211
after only a few weeks , mrs rothe , it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this , but in any case , i have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail .    4.245213259162902
as yet , we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed , but one thing i can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably .    5.1717660202470155
finally , of course , the cyprus question has a role in the discussions with turkey .    3.7928609455004203
i met the turkish foreign minister in brussels a few weeks ago and naturally i asked if turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue .    3.345498077151767
i would just make one point : we cannot be 100 % sure - i am not at any rate - that one only has to press a UNK in ankara to set the wheels in motion in cyprus .    3.709898041772152
it is very far from being that simple , rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts , during talks with both communities , to encourage them to reach an understanding .    3.5535822032479665
that is what we intend to do : the necessary measures and programmes are in place .    3.583492824268372
i must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation , the one that has yet to be decided on here , before we can even get started .    4.472358830778749
the financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with malta and cyprus .    4.236647505487184
i cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place , because i lack the legal basis for doing so .    4.200025288909927
if the UNK lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point , then i am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that .    4.282659882420733
this legal framework is UNK out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the commission and the council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management .    4.046148999343543
on the contrary , i would say that , although many areas of european policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence , in this instance i would claim , on behalf of the commission and the council , that we have developed a very clear , transparent and coherent policy .    4.6390109762451655
. ( de ) mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , now that the commissioner has explained to us , in an extremely coherent manner , that the erstwhile president - in - office of the council and his minister of state for europe UNK responsibility for the lack of coherence , perhaps you could help the commissioner and ourselves , so as to enable us to take this decision .    3.878881311528267
it would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the financial perspective up until 2004 and on heading b7 , or if you could at least confirm that the portuguese council presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence , which is something the commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the commission .    3.943558381253553
. ( pt ) mr president , i am sure that the issue raised by my friend elmar brok will be considered by the council .    3.1118513631507407
i feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate .    3.8980243877897016
i believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent , regardless of who was involved in that work .    3.3241888691115533
in any case , the question that this raises is an important one and the council will not fail to support the proposals that the commission has presented in this respect .    4.651674952041555
i would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us .    3.89600082750201
forgive me mr poos .    3.7139259107179607
there was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me .    3.510276933140994
this is how matters stand with regard to meda : malta and cyprus can take part in the national programmes , but not in the country - specific ones , because the incomes are too high .    4.388515013441756
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place on thursday .    1.945412249527279
question time ( council )    2.6418022395480705
question no 1 by ( h - 0022 / 00 ) :    2.440117267560729
subject : controlling access to community waters for oil tankers in connection with the accident involving the oil tanker erika off the french coast , which produced a large oil slick , what steps does the council intend to take to control access to community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet community safety standards ?    2.8192685676039884
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , on 24 january the council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker erika .    2.5538948639993237
at that time , bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident , the council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it .    3.284888005361862
the council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field .    4.252373382355812
it emphasised the importance of the council taking new measures within a community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations .    4.679706558688037
as you know , as currently framed , community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels , including those flying flags of convenience , and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards .    3.400767185334801
there is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject .    3.0695772598798685
with regard to the future , the council noted that work within the commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls , together with provisions on the qualifications of UNK agencies .    4.239774775372291
there are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting community ports .    3.2969786642155285
these dossiers will be progressed by the transport council and i can therefore assure you , on behalf of the council , that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals , which there is every indication the commission is due to present in this area , which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection .    5.053967125389616
this house will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals , given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure .    4.27312560291293
i am pleased that the council is considering this question .    3.405178890439934
the president of the council comes from a country , portugal , which is directly at risk from just this type of situation .    4.616852634611942
if we stretched our UNK , we could envisage a situation where , between now and next summer , an oil tanker may run UNK under similar circumstances off the UNK , wreck the portuguese summer tourist industry , with a bit of luck the sea UNK would carry the pollution towards the island of madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore , wreck tourism in the canary islands as well .    3.720721278981503
of course , the story of the erika seems UNK .    3.2840460342494104
a french - owned ship , under a maltese flag of convenience , an indian crew , a sea - worthiness certificate issued by italy , in sicily , with the last inspection carried out in bulgaria , i think .    3.4437751118508055
the ship was sinking and the UNK realised that it was sinking and that it was not even going to make it to the next port .    5.213185422492401
this kind of situation should not be allowed .    3.956068344913653
the damage to your country , mr president , and to mine , spain , could be horrendous .    4.925674955386353
mr medina ortega , i naturally share your concerns and i can assure you that a coastal country like my own , the country currently holding the presidency , is naturally very concerned about this issue , all the more so as it does not have any oil tankers of its own .    3.9032485125644825
however , we have to work within the existing legislative framework .    3.30324837826322
that legislative framework is the 1995 directive , which has a set of regulations with a degree of flexibility which should perhaps be implemented more rigorously .    3.7255061592351213
in this area we have to work with the world as it is , and that means reacting in accordance with the facts of the situation .    4.750876633409301
in view of the seriousness of such situations , we can congratulate ourselves on the fact that the authorities have at least reacted and undertaken to examine the legislative provisions already existing in this field .    3.694179955389168
the council is minded to give priority to this area , within the transport council , and we intend to follow this up as quickly as possible .    4.200167021204931
we also hope that the european parliament will be able to examine this issue with equal UNK when it comes before this house under the codecision procedure .    3.986937502530027
mr president , in UNK , in finland , there is currently a vessel carrying chemicals , which is sailing under a flag of convenience .    3.6890274957086597
the vessel is anchored outside the port , as the condition it is in is a safety UNK for the port and the surrounding areas , and because it cannot be inspected properly , as there is no one who will pay .    4.429048806651387
would it be possible for the eu to create a standardised inspection system that would also guarantee payment , out of community funds , for the inspection of ships that fly a flag of convenience and cannot themselves pay the cost ?    3.7046671788346703
- ( pt ) mrs UNK , as you will understand , i do not at the moment have the information i need to give you a concrete reply .    4.455332761850997
the information that i have is to do with the 1995 directive , which does not include any provisions of that kind .    4.20303889902997
question no 2 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.3004546900797207
subject : high infant mortality levels in kosovo according to the most recent un information forwarded to the world health organisation , kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in europe . about 50 % of premature babies do not survive and the war has resulted in a massive increase in the number of miscarriages .    2.967238511293804
even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped .    3.0298369254855197
in view of the humanitarian aid being given by the european union and the efforts being made by the head of the interim administration , mr bernard kouchner , what measures will the council take to defend the rights of the women of kosovo to motherhood and to protect the health of pregnant women , women in UNK and new - born children ?    3.464924083165903
mr president , mrs karamanou ' s question is an extremely serious one , and i would not wish to conceal that fact .    4.024235605323491
we are perfectly aware of the difficult and dramatic humanitarian situation in kosovo and of the problem of displaced people in that region - and i mean people who originate from kosovo - and of the particular effect of this on child health and on mortality rates .    4.599673217630382
i think it is well known that the european union has made a clear contribution to the humanitarian aid effort being made by the international community .    3.8209734607657
as you know , the european community has contributed a total of eur 378 million for the province of kosovo alone , and this has to be seen in conjunction with the contributions made by member states at national level .    3.7735644458655595
this contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and health systems and of water purification .    3.6043407065978976
furthermore , as you know , the european union makes a contribution to the united nations high commission for refugees , which came to eur 66 . 3 million in 1999 .    4.022641327508125
i think that mrs karamanou is aware that , because of the need for division of labour between the international donors , the task of restoring health care in kosovo has been entrusted to the world health organisation .    3.9003496466416814
the reports produced by the who indicate that it is fully aware of the alarming infant mortality situation , and it has focused its efforts on improving basic conditions in UNK and general hospitals .    4.153565369288637
nevertheless , we are aware that this situation is far from a satisfactory solution and that there are widespread repercussions in other areas of health care , apart from child health .    4.16512193478656
this is not just a technical situation , it is a political situation , and it goes hand in hand with the need to solve the political situation , because there are aspects to this , and we may as well be open about this , which are associated with the international community ' s inability up to now to make a multi - ethnic society function in kosovo , with tragic effects on attempts to improve health care in that region .    4.878164650922757
mr president - in - office of the council , i thank you for your answer which supplements what commissioner patten said yesterday on the subject .    2.691172463410226
yet , the sum of eur 378 million you mentioned had been given in 1999 , was proved by the facts to be quite insufficient to create even UNK civilised conditions in kosovo , especially where the provision of health services is concerned .    3.4724714271836756
mr president - in - office , do you not think that the very fact of increased child mortality is an UNK for the continent of europe , a shameful thing , which should motivate us all , so that the aid we provide becomes more effective and more generous ?    3.9863536802752044
of course , the situation was not UNK , even before the bombardments , anything but , i should say . however , since nato ' s intervention , there has been a very clear deterioration in the natural and human environment .    4.310684213430753
so , mr president - in - office of the council , is it not a moral obligation that we should try to create civilised conditions for the long - suffering inhabitants of kosovo , and above all , keep our promises to them ?    3.6577179978639163
mrs karamanou , i recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in kosovo in this field have not been enough .    5.613343551591732
i do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that .    2.6575626189976536
i do not want to link this question with your comments about the period " before " and " after " nato ' s intervention , as we will probably touch on that issue at another point during this question time .    3.293633749049745
nevertheless , i would like to say that the european union is aware that the resources it has devoted to kosovo reflect the financial limitations it has to work within .    3.7036104648008563
we have to remember that we share responsibility in that region with the international community .    3.2590191061331844
the european union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role , but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were , as you have said yourself , mrs karamanou , not the best before the military action in kosovo .    3.6513670114910153
what is more , i do not believe , mrs karamanou , that the military action in kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation .    4.140532425496976
this is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole .    3.14919828687786
and if we cannot solve the political problem , which must be done in accordance with the relevant united nations resolution , then we will not solve the problem of child health , nor the various other problems faced by this region .    4.098881212817301
i would like to widen the debate and include the situation in mitrovica .    3.7542902111763072
in cooperation with europe , the international community UNK the hospital there too , but it is located in the northern part of the city , thus prohibiting access to albanian kosovars .    4.048209413729102
this means that medical aid is still denied to the albanian kosovars .    2.892302678650998
this is also happening elsewhere in the country , causing tension between the albanian kosovars and serbs , making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where albanians do not want to be looked after by serbs and vice versa .    3.2203050907163093
i understand very well what you are saying and you are right : the european union should work in a wider context of international cooperation .    3.872691449057974
but where will you place the emphasis ?    3.5652565895715393
what will you do to ensure that albanian kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital , including that in mitrovica ?    3.4070452279693395
mr staes , the situation in mitrovica is well known .    3.765809603150973
this is a very special situation with a degree of inter - ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of kosovo .    2.7609247579886453
i perfectly understand mr staes ' s concerns .    2.972118349242575
nevertheless , i would like to say that bernard kouchner ' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant united nations resolution , in an attempt to create multi - ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities , including the various aspects of the administration .    3.9034281904376793
i believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible , because there are various protagonists involved .    3.157060730641809
the situation in mitrovica is appalling , and involves very special tensions , and i believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed .    3.8847631469675723
nevertheless , i have to say that , regrettably , we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the member states ' contributions - to guarantee the follow - up action we proposed to the military action , that is to say the establishment of inter - ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities , and , in particular , access to hospitals .    4.037553580820802
question no 3 by ( h - 0027 / 00 ) :    2.889343882359955
subject : indictment of nato before war crimes tribunal human rights organisations , such as the us human rights watch , have already collected significant evidence of nato crimes in connection with the bombing of kosovo and serbia with a view to bringing a case before the war crimes tribunal in the hague .    3.135436056281469
on the basis of this evidence , some of which has already been lodged with the tribunal , nato is accused of ' serious violations of international humanitarian law ' and ' UNK murder ' .    3.232822693956249
does the council consider that such accusations should be put before the war crimes tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation ?    3.0178111140655353
in the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against nato , what will be done in respect of the high representative for the cfsp , who was nato secretary - general during the crisis ?    3.73295596761747
is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed ?    3.0489111565664886
mr president , mr alavanos ' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues .    3.1174873388091573
the council has already , on various occasions , stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by nato were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the united nations security council resolutions .    3.1261628425951167
i am aware that there may be different views about nato ' s action and the legitimacy of that action .    3.194593947111663
everyone is free to hold such views .    2.8158817857086738
in my own country , the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter .    2.9877653803011475
that was how it was .    3.3860726093087283
in any case , the council ' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the north atlantic treaty organisation in the federal republic of yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in kosovo caused by the belgrade regime .    3.345168795710511
this objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the general affairs council in luxembourg on 8 april .    3.774347799260797
i must say that these nato measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all UNK for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the kosovo albanians from their land .    3.2540386554029523
i am sure you are aware , mr alavanos , that , during her recent visit to nato headquarters , prosecutor del ponte stressed that the international tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it , including those made against nato , in particular by pacifist groups from canada .    3.392052619232491
this compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted .    4.157863543291942
in any case , i have with me a statement made by prosecutor del ponte according to which nato is not at present under any investigation by the office of the prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning nato ' s actions in the kosovo conflict .    3.7915092038056755
all information received during the past six months , either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of nato ' s actions during the kosovo conflict , have been recorded by the prosecutor .    3.337137819151075
until that time prosecutor del ponte has decided not to examine any of the accusations of UNK made against nato .    3.3085290543807795
if the president - in - office has noticed , almost half the questions he has had to answer today relate to kosovo .    3.203936796219647
despite this , he too accepted that the inquisition procedure of the war crimes tribunal against nato after applications by canadian and other pacifist organisations is an open question .    2.996518121118389
my question , which the president - in - office did not answer , is this : if this inquisition procedure begins , in which the main or , if you will , one of the main people UNK and probably found guilty will be mr solana , who is today the high representative of the european union ' s common foreign and security policy , should it not be , if that happens , if the general prosecutor of the tribunal is determined to begin the process , that mr solana ' s status is suspended at least until it is shown that his hands are clean ?    4.044991509718024
mr alavanos , if an action of this kind should be brought against nato and if this action were to be brought against mr javier solana personally , we would have to bear in mind that mr javier solana held one post at that time and is holding a different one today .    3.933695031011859
in the absence of any corresponding indication from any international judicial body which could justify any personal UNK against mr javier solana - and there is no sign of this whatsoever - the european union will not of course make any statement at all on this matter .    3.2781427465165014
mr president , i believe mr alavanos is getting nato and mr milosevic mixed up .    2.9709354588756054
mr milosevic should be appearing before the war crimes tribunal and we should be awarding nato the UNK prize .    3.448927176573303
but i have a quite different question for the council .    3.970889157446956
how do matters stand in kosovo with regard to the rebuilding of the administration , the judiciary and , most importantly of all , the police force ?    4.097131476471331
you mentioned before that we are on the brink of catastrophe there and nothing is being done .    3.8647425145328227
rapid action is called for !    3.684630094219304
as you know , the first steps were taken some months ago .    3.14334346202369
we are all aware of the difficulties , and particularly the financial difficulties , that mr kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery , and , in particular , we are aware of the special difficulty involved in UNK police so as to ensure day - to - day public safety .    3.5547707341748835
this is a responsibility that the european union takes very seriously , mr posselt , and i would like to mention that , at the general affairs council held on monday , this issue was repeatedly stressed when we were discussing kosovo .    4.1185147988658
statements were made and pressure was brought to bear on the various member states who have undertaken to make police resources available to honour their commitments .    3.525525719934929
some member states are taking refuge in the fact that they have provided military forces and that they cannot send the police forces , to which they committed themselves , as quickly as they would like .    4.618242572053161
we are certainly very much aware that this factor is seriously compromising mr kouchner ' s work and the normalisation of administrative structures in kosovo , especially as regards judicial structures and police cover .    3.381764165678034
this is having unfortunate and obvious effects on the scope for controlling inter - ethnic coordination , and we are all conscious that , if measures are not taken in the short term , we may end up with situations involving the kind of tensions that we witnessed just a few hours ago , and that these tensions may be mirrored in other areas of kosovo .    4.228574985412477
this is obviously a question which really has to be seen in a nato context , but , as the european union shares nato ' s view of these issues , it is not difficult for us to associate ourselves with this . i would like to make this clear on behalf of the council , so that there can be no doubt .    5.105714255899581
mr marset campos , you will be aware , first of all , of how difficult it is to select targets during a military operation , particularly an air - based one , and you will also be aware that there is a category of targets that , whilst they are not military targets as such , are infrastructure targets selected with a view to hindering the smooth running of the military machine .    3.7799233097739533
we are of course entering a grey area here , and you may say , mr marset campos , that these are civilian targets , such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure , whilst others will tell me that they are military targets , because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by mr milosevic ' s forces in kosovo .    3.621987784239465
so we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets .    3.4606661076180227
unfortunately , and as everyone recognised during the military action in kosovo , there were civilian sectors , and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public , and even inhabited areas , which were directly affected by nato air attacks .    3.9309549940425192
this is generally recognised and this happens in all wars , and the kosovo war was not a clean war , nor a model war , but a war based on the art of the possible .    4.207197074969133
and , above all , it was a necessary war , and it was not only about what was possible , it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community .    4.193381604177475
mr marset campos , regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight , if you take no action yourself - i believe that , if we look at what happened in bosnia and herzegovina , and at the impunity that the situation in bosnia and herzegovina led to , and the continuation of that impunity , then we might perhaps see the nato military action in kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light .    4.068799866094805
question no 4 by ( h - 0028 / 00 ) :    2.946823309314704
subject : turkish blockade of armenia given that the european union is actively promoting social , economic and political relations with armenia through the partnership and cooperation agreement , signed on 12 october 1999 , what steps is the council taking to persuade the turkish government to lift the economic blockade of armenia ?    2.1439393134825293
has the time come for the turkish government to lift the economic blockade of armenia ?    2.385590269718091
mr president , i would like to thank the representative of the council presidency for his answer .    3.1525139411465064
nevertheless , i am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when , ultimately , there is in fact a major tripartite relationship .    4.277282741989177
we provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place , in order to help armenia , and still the aid cannot come into play because turkey has imposed an economic blockade , and so many things cannot get through to the armenians at all .    3.8633634115250866
we are negotiating with turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours .    4.235080566055192
- ( pt ) mrs schleicher , you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and , particularly , that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem .    4.607502292928061
we feel that precisely because turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the european union , and also because turkey now has to respond to the european union ' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues , we will , to be frank , be testing turkey ' s will as regards the european union ' s priorities in its foreign relations .    4.191715543230742
our relationship with armenia , as UNK by the agreement we signed with that country last year , is of course one element in these foreign relations .    4.104657627994638
we also feel that , if turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the european union and the general framework of the european union ' s relations , regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country , it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the european union in its foreign relations .    4.1374413093795965
we are , moreover , convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the european union and turkey in the near future .    3.754553093118217
question no 6 by ( h - 0122 / 00 ) :    2.523113644980411
subject : ethnic cleansing of serbs in kosovo since the end of the bombing of yugoslavia by nato and the eu aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of kosovar albanians by serbia , and since the arrival of kfor on 12 june 1999 , 200 000 serbs living in kosovo have been expelled and UNK murdered , UNK ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the serbs themselves .    3.0324019706422027
during the last few days we have seen serbs murdered by kosovar albanian mafia - type groups , also with impunity .    3.451188246923356
what decision will the council adopt to put an end , once and for all , to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of kosovo , irrespective of race or UNK ?    4.478968216923292
i thank the minister for his response , but i would also like to point out that , UNK , there is now more violence in kosovo than there was before the nato bombing .    4.330373988560095
it is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation , and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of nato and the european union to take such action .    4.203430485608665
i agree with what the minister very rightly said about the UNK of belgrade , but we should also remember that the secret services of the usa , germany , france , italy and the united kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the kla , a mafia , which has contributed to the problems in the area .    4.288321312476983
we are therefore all to blame .    2.94850872395731
i would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context .    2.8371436988233363
do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on serbia in order to UNK the area economically and also to benefit kosovo as a province of serbia ?    3.880546098022013
mr president , i am no friend of milosevic or his government .    2.5587146102876077
nevertheless i have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of nato ' s action against yugoslavia over kosovo , both in terms of the lack of authority from the un security council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on serbia ' s sovereignty at UNK .    3.7602505437307876
the current situation in kosovo , which is now ethnically UNK of serbs and roma , speaks for itself .    3.614277528867182
should nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the belgrade tv tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists , which remains a severe moral UNK on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our western leaders ?    3.194121680557062
mr UNK , with regard to the position adopted by the european union , we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives , and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were UNK up mr milosevic ' s political system and acting as propaganda for him .    4.025712640238686
i cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by nato , but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree .    3.8313654015705594
some of these actions might have been questionable , and some were regarded as unfortunate by nato itself , but others were justified for tactical reasons , with the aim of preventing mr milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former yugoslavia .    3.249436594286681
in any event , i , on behalf of the council , do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by nato .    3.830297014747824
mr president - in - office of the council , since i know the history of the balkans , i should like to remind you that , for many decades , the peoples of yugoslavia lived in peace .    3.3598652517124914
destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break - up of yugoslavia , in which the european union played a decisive part .    3.8720695597285646
yugoslavia ' s crime was that it was the only balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of nato or of the european union .    3.8050831940293937
so whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly UNK kla , under the very nose of kfor , whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent .    3.1711587292008616
every day , new crimes come to light against non - albanian speakers and against the cultural heritage of kosovo , and there are hundreds of violations of the un ' s resolution 1244 .    3.8521943164721164
in my opinion , the best thing the council could do would be to cease occupying that part of yugoslavia and search for a solution acceptable to all sides , with respect for the various national characteristics in the area and especially respect for the principle of non - intervention in the internal affairs of another , independent country .    3.8427541295560146
i respect your understanding and knowledge of the balkan region , mr alyssandrakis , but i find it difficult , quite frankly , to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can , in terms of political stability , be a solution to the problem .    4.21534810837351
if we look at the democratic stability of the region , it could perhaps be said that it was the break - up of yugoslavia that caused the current situation , but let us not get involved in interpreting an international development .    3.9875031883044985
nevertheless , i would like to say that yugoslavia was what it was , in the sense that the state managed to harmonise some of its people ' s ethnic differences to a degree . it must be pointed out that it did this at a time when its political framework was far from ideal in terms of being democratically representative .    4.136020027425598
the division of yugoslavia is probably a historical fact that we shall have to accept , regardless of the mistakes that may have been made along the way .    4.25789938394303
we do not feel that withdrawing international forces now would be any kind of solution . quite the contrary , it would be a solution leading to calamity .    3.222387462266653
mr president , i was a little disappointed with the answer given by the president - in - office to my colleague .    3.469467424065082
it is very important , if we stress that europe is to be a europe of values , that we do not go down the road of saying that means justify ends .    4.945026077975251
it should not be defended even by those of us who deeply deplore the milosevic regime .    2.923411522708034
that , however , is not my question .    4.456778266175229
my question is about political prisoners held in serbia now .    2.9431250089735945
there are , i believe , around 5 000 kosovar political prisoners held in serbia at the moment .    3.2349366364904393
my question to the president - in - office is twofold .    3.338084617388079
firstly , is the council fully aware of and concerned about the fate of these prisoners ?    4.225254831620879
secondly , what does it propose to do about them ?    3.417802500761412
mr maccormick , first of all , i would like to answer your comments .    3.1974494157015285
i did not defend attacks on civilians .    3.150478519377731
what is a legitimate target is obviously a grey area .    3.1377452566288864
as i said , we are not making value judgements about specific actions .    3.1658528802787766
we are making an overall value judgement about nato ' s action , and this overall value judgement is positive . we agree with the general view of nato ' s action .    3.82388604642924
with regard to political prisoners in serbia , mr maccormick , it is obvious that , when i say that in serbia today mr milosevic is not acting in accordance with the rules of a decent society at international level , i am referring specifically , not just to the way he acts towards his fellow citizens . i am also referring to the way mr milosevic UNK political prisoners , and the way he attacks democratic rights and the opposition ' s rights of access to the media , and to his attacks on the facilities that should be granted to non - governmental organisations , particularly those protecting human rights .    4.31143215621268
in spite of everything , all this represents only one of many kinds of highly pernicious action perpetrated by mr milosevic on UNK society , and the european union is of course inevitably concerned about this situation .    3.6927214353458475
this is precisely why the european union is maintaining all its sanctions until yugoslavia ' s behaviour on the international stage reflects the values that we have to defend .    3.970221819148323
question no 7 by ( h - 0035 / 00 ) :    2.8895453425356754
subject : drafting of the charter of fundamental rights the general public welcomes the fact that a charter of fundamental rights is to be drawn up . it is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of europe in the 21st century .    2.707969777593037
what are the council ' s views on the substance of the charter ? what type of rights will the charter set out ( economic , social and cultural ) ?    2.0768489097562655
which citizens will it cover ( those of the european union or the citizens of all european countries with a view to enlargement ? will it cover immigrants etc . ? ) ?    2.40337821289576
will it set out established social rights in the european union or will it set a broader agenda ?    2.4165968695374707
what means will the charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?    2.278789256186407
what are the council ' s views on incorporating the charter into the treaty on european union ?    3.1324105554808823
i thank the president - in - office for the concerns and certainties he has expressed about the progress of the work .    2.982301316019888
you will understand , mr president - in - office , that there was a point to my question , because the council is a political body of the european union and the citizens of europe , men and women , want to know how it views the democratic and social model of europe in the twenty - first century .    3.9015474828764045
as a supplementary question , i should like to ask you whether , as the portuguese presidency , you have made provision for the rights of children , as such , to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the charter .    4.741707717787192
as i said , mrs kratsa - tsagaropoulou , we are not in control of the procedure for drawing up the charter of fundamental rights .    2.9663307140981643
this procedure falls within the competence of the members of the group , and the matter will only be submitted to the council if and when consensus is reached on the terms of this charter .    4.81058058356236
i would nevertheless like to say , with regard to the rights of the child , that we consider this to be an extremely topical issue , particularly for the council of europe and in view of the existence of a set of relevant international texts to which we have signed up .    4.557384642951964
this matter should form part of the charter of fundamental rights .    3.1268270404588674
this will certainly be the guideline that my government for one will advocate for the charter of fundamental rights .    2.7378001066933133
furthermore , we will see if we can do this for a range of other proposals that we have on this issue .    4.640925087379162
i do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not .    2.971153016559804
i presume , however , that this is not a particularly controversial matter and we think that it would simply involve bringing together the currently agreed corpus of rights , which even the most elementary justice would suggest should be included in the charter and be shared by the union as a whole .    3.9175418490992406
i would remind members that , according to the guidelines for these sittings , questions must be concise and be worded in a way which will allow a brief answer .    3.538459784645293
you know that there is a parliamentary delegation chaired by mr UNK de UNK and a committee on constitutional affairs where these issues can be debated at great length .    3.737811079388308
i therefore ask that both questions and answers be very brief .    3.2030765952564564
otherwise , we would be in a way undermining the whole process of drawing up the charter of fundamental rights .    3.820419844403604
i am sure that the president - in - office of the council is prepared to answer everything , but i must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers .    3.3148959616770695
mr rübig has the floor .    3.790814791314614
mr president , fourteen member states have imposed bilateral sanctions on another member state , because a democratically elected government was formed there .    3.3752136754667776
both parties were once part of the government .    4.19805460327805
so far there have been no infringements of the law .    3.5543456609608635
are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the charter of human rights ?    4.002870867054579
is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the charter of fundamental rights ?    2.997193417388591
mr rübig , as president - in - office , i cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the portuguese prime minister on behalf of the fourteen heads of state and government of the member states of the european union was adopted UNK and not by him in his capacity as president - in - office of the council of the european union .    3.3964092354577775
nevertheless , i would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these member states was actually a set of actions of what i would call preventive political action at diplomatic level . we feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which , although it has become part of a european union government , does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the union ' s aims .    3.9321598259962562
mr president , i have the honour of being a member of the convention drafting the charter so i am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force .    3.498756439140704
what i would like to know is what will happen to the draft charter that the convention draws up ?    3.479188524663795
will the council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands , or will the council feel free to amend that document ?    4.084710132107886
will the council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then UNK that draft charter ?    3.3584074198779623
- ( pt ) the answer is neither yes nor no .    2.8612740856037027
i do not know , mr martin . it will depend on the decision taken by the council .    3.2827613334464876
question no 8 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    1.9370235727467726
subject : granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey the UNK meeting in cologne called on the oecd to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits .    3.159928806342026
these can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects .    3.686304159404284
will the eu take the lead in UNK this process ?    3.3044983804741284
the need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the british government that it is ' minded to grant ' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey .    3.399531443946689
the world bank has decided not to fund the project , which will UNK 20 000 UNK , potentially limit the fresh water supply to syria and iraq and cause ecological damage .    3.527083043413966
what is the council ' s view of the involvement of european governments and companies in this project ?    4.404692797809562
the process of agreeing these common standards may have started as long ago as UNK but clearly the fact that the british government appears to be going ahead with a massively environmentally damaging project suggests that it has not been very successful so far .    3.5190359489397975
i wonder if you would answer a question concerning investment by eu companies in the eu applicant countries .    3.3971283622761823
i ask this because of the issue of coherence , the subject of this morning ' s discussion .    4.611578100898946
on the one hand we ask applicant countries to take on board the environmental acquis and yet , at the very same time , the eu member states are supporting and encouraging investment in those countries which is itself hugely environmentally damaging .    3.7835736982561077
can you say whether or not the specific issue of investment in applicant countries has featured in any of the discussions to date to which you have been referring ?    3.5369149317068187
- ( pt ) mrs lucas , i was not present at the debate you are referring to .    3.023782821186124
i would like to say that the council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing , at a later date .    3.554589852649937
question no 9 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    1.9445862029259378
subject : environmental problems caused by the drogheda port company development project , and the role of the court of auditors a major conflict between environmental conservation and structural development interests has arisen in the area of the boyne estuary , ireland , following a development project of the drogheda port company .    3.6003419699885457
the affected area is designated a special protection area ( spa ) under the wild birds directive and is under consideration for a special area of conservation under the habitats directive , as it is an area of international importance . many local and european associations have strongly criticised the project .    2.3315745008787765
similar cases occur in other regions of the union , where eu development funding conflicts with environmental unsustainability of the beneficiary measures .    3.431583568020359
what kind of measures does the council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the european institutions in similar cases ?    3.9161606601209744
. ( pt ) in response to your question , mrs mckenna , i would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the court of auditors was laid down in the treaty establishing the european community .    3.771090173652385
in accordance with article UNK of the treaty , the auditing of accounts is carried out by the court of auditors which , to this end , studies the accounts of all revenue and expenditure of the community as well as the regularity and the legality of the underlying transactions . the court also guarantees proper financial management .    3.5303781828233296
this is indeed also stipulated in article 248 .    3.278447478503093
the court of auditors , therefore , already has all the instruments necessary to carry out its role .    3.7200512510846693
with regard to your suggestion for increasing the court ' s resources , the council considers that all of the union ' s institutions have , under the community budget , the necessary financial means for them to be able to properly carry out their respective UNK .    4.532134283539236
in some cases , it would probably be desirable for their financial resources to be increased , but there are budgetary restraints of which i am sure you are aware .    3.842225547637677
i would like to take this opportunity to remind you that the budget of the european union is approved by common agreement between the council and this parliament .    3.300282858377612
the council therefore , has no means of changing the role conferred on the court of auditors by the treaty .    3.1870333056418567
if extra resources were given to the court of auditors it would be money well spent , because it would ensure that eu funding was not going to something that UNK with environmental concerns .    4.529295335198874
for years the council has been blocking the strategic development impact assessment of plans and programmes .    3.226208275683706
i would ask you , now that you are president of the council , will you push forward with this extremely important proposal .    4.101340711681356
secondly , as there is no mention of structural funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ?    4.5619559706271255
i would like to know what you could do about this as president - in - office of the council at the moment because it is the council that has been blocking this for a long time .    3.629158445537546
it is extremely important .    2.4498058222521264
if the court of auditors were able to assess regularly the potential conflicts between environmental concerns and structural development , it would be very important because the court of auditors could do an extremely good job .    3.583737882662873
their reports are extremely detailed and very important .    3.4751083973072228
this is the way to ensure that such conflicts are avoided in the future .    3.6936762879727936
- ( pt ) mrs mckenna , a large part of the problem you have raised relates to issues which are the responsibility of the commission .    3.7458233423498326
it is therefore the commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions .    3.4305980027267395
the commission will have to provide specific answers to these questions .    3.2213716532745185
i do not think that i can give a more complete answer on the specific case that you quoted .    3.23521124203422
question no 10 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    2.3042659781943584
subject : statute for members of the european parliament the council and parliament are going to try to reach agreement on a statute for the members of the european parliament .    4.251937495363649
one of the matters to be settled is whether members are to receive equal pay , and where they are to pay tax .    4.003861810163739
according to media reports the portuguese presidency considers that all members should pay the same tax , to the eu . this is in conflict with the view taken by some member states who wish to have the right to tax their members in their home countries .    4.823185739855612
will the portuguese presidency clarify its position on this matter ?    4.175900948693653
. ( pt ) the portuguese presidency is particularly interested in this issue , as i suppose that this is the first time a presidency has made resolving the problem of a statute for members of the european parliament a priority in its programme .    4.282250031131916
the portuguese presidency made reaching an agreement on this statute one of its priorities , as furthermore , did the president of the european parliament , when she stated this at the helsinki european council .    3.716776411443825
we are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter .    3.223973158594029
we are therefore taking advantage of this political will in an attempt to define the outlines of a compromise , and we have already begun work on this matter .    3.7930216841353905
it is worth pointing out once more that this compromise will require the unanimous support of the council , in accordance with article 190 , and the assent of this parliament , to which it falls to approve this statute .    4.361106418699071
the presidency has engaged in intensive discussions with a range of members of this parliament and with the group to which parliament entrusted the task of negotiating with the council .    4.051373586623823
i myself had an opportunity to meet this group , for the first time , in parallel with the january part - session , and i am trying to arrange to do so again soon in order to continue these discussions .    4.423169462474025
these discussions have also UNK more intensively in the relevant bodies of the council , and i think that i can say , in a spirit of openness and greater flexibility , and because we all recognise the importance that this has , particularly for the general public , that drawing up this statute is a vital factor in ensuring both the dignity of the functions of members of the european parliament and the necessary transparency and good management of public funds .    4.041061191745244
this has , from the outset , been the position of the portuguese presidency .    3.8110734789359233
nevertheless , our role as UNK means that we must take account of all current attitudes in the council and i am sure you are aware , mr sjöstedt , that the tax issue poses problems for certain delegations .    4.420216941042153
as this is the case , whatever solution is found , i think that it will have to respect both democratic law and be acceptable to all member states , regardless of their national positions on the matter .    4.481773340427025
what i can promise with regard to this issue is that the presidency has the utmost commitment to working , for as long as it is involved with this matter , in an atmosphere of total transparency and openness towards members of the european parliament . we will also make the utmost effort with members of the council , particularly with those who had most difficulty in accepting the proposal suggested last year , so as to reach a reasonable compromise solution , and one which would at the same time guarantee the dignity appropriate for a statute for the members of this house .    4.477167779486097
my basic view is that one ought to pay tax in the country in which one lives , in which one ' s family lives and in which one benefits from public services .    4.205588140897895
i intended to ask the presidency if there really is an argument for saying that we should not pay tax in our own countries just as other people do .    4.062098057869839
that is my first question .    3.139429085144091
my second question is about whether the portuguese presidency can accept a solution which involves the tax issue ' s being solved in different ways for members of different nationalities , or whether you want a solution which is identical for members of all nationalities .    3.5897721105028517
- ( pt ) without wishing to show any lack of respect towards this house and particularly because of the respect that your questions deserve , i would rather not answer the questions you have raised immediately .    4.185379267738076
we are in the midst of rather sensitive negotiations .    2.8716908613240797
this sensitivity is reflected in the way in which the presidency of the council of the european union expresses itself in a specific context in relation to particular situations .    4.672233727599093
this has an impact of course , because it is read by other members of the council .    4.263225314334789
at this stage in the discussion , please forgive me if i cannot give a direct answer to the specific questions that have been put to me . i would ask that we be judged on our results , when we endeavour to reach a more concrete solution in the near future .    3.9659805097749645
i will be happy to come back to parliament to respond to and clarify the problems which may conceivably occur if a result is not reached , or to congratulate all of you if this result is achieved .    3.7683358268334
i would like to ask the president - in - office of the council , after his few hours working in this chamber with these members of the european parliament , whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay ?    3.758219421195036
mr purvis , as this discussion of salaries in the european parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country , i have a precise idea of what the salaries of the members of the european parliament are worth .    4.60956882439631
i am therefore perfectly aware of this problem .    3.3776228536885684
mr president , i want to thank you for your answer . i want to ask a follow - up question which bears some resemblance to the one mr sjöstedt asked .    2.888017871476098
we both come from sweden . in our country , we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local .    3.701564780649891
we have extensive services , too . we have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and , not least , in european politicians here in parliament .    3.610987478061265
how do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education , health care etc - but , at the same time , did not pay any tax and did not contribute ?    3.1753552178514375
how do you think a system like that would affect people ' s confidence in ourselves as politicians ?    3.200926480948899
mr president - in - office of the council , i do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question .    2.990099697742931
however , if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy , go ahead !    2.714188527744824
. mr president , i have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy .    3.0371920467058033
these are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the statute for members and of its role in the context of political society .    3.798661525660134
i would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter .    2.822969452745184
since the time allotted to questions to the council has elapsed , questions nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing .    2.5811666476665027
that concludes questions to the council .    2.535807542533868
( the sitting was suspended at 7 . 05 p . m . and resumed at 9 . 00 p . m . )    1.751135693003665
address by mr vaclav havel , president of the czech republic    3.4784231501685126
mr president in office , ladies and gentlemen , i have great honour in extending a warm welcome , on behalf of the house , to the president of the czech republic , mr vaclav havel .    3.7254062159525745
i should also like to welcome mrs havel , who is sitting in the gallery .    3.3757487238160797
you are most welcome .    3.2444136271184796
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
this is not your first visit to our parliament , mr president .    3.3640101793860744
you addressed plenary in strasbourg nearly six years ago , in march 1994 , and many of us , who were already european members of parliament at that time , still have a vivid UNK of your speech .    3.9796485804709154
in fact , shortly after the maastricht treaty was ratified , you spoke in favour of strengthening european values , creating a european ethical dimension and opening the union to the countries of central and eastern europe .    3.1737720424194547
in other words , for many citizens , and not just in your country , you UNK the european values to which we constantly voice our attachment .    3.91052700274425
there have been extremely dynamic developments in relations between the union and the czech republic following two european elections and a major new reform of the european treaties .    4.295518476586641
an association agreement has been signed and a joint parliamentary committee has been set up by the european parliament and the czech parliament .    4.081302877735599
your country filed an official application to join the union in 1996 and accession negotiations were finally officially opened in 1998 .    3.3102235583765167
the process of european integration and enlargement has UNK up impressively since the fall of the iron curtain .    3.000144266201722
the end of this artificial separation of europe marked the start of a new era .    3.632490579117306
we now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of europe .    2.861352542275181
mr president , you are a symbol of these changes .    3.3099816500825305
you founded and signed charter 77 , the human rights movement which represented and called for fundamental values during a dark period in the history of your people .    3.3298039300973166
a communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity .    2.998469183816306
but you never lost hope and history proved you right .    2.7558853562697077
ten years ago , the " UNK revolution " proclaimed havel UNK UNK .    3.5566482258369727
for ten years you represented democratic UNK and , later , the czech republic , as its president .    3.5499404259067684
reconciliation with your neighbours was , and still is , a basic objective which you have defended with vigour and perseverance .    3.9288925240661903
today , the czech republic is preparing to join our union .    3.20831111951443
i am sure that you will agree , mr president , and experience has shown us , that the process of enlargement of the union is not without its UNK for both parties and the czech republic will need to make a great deal of effort in order to meet the accession criteria .    4.452811382429422
the european union , for its part , will need to adapt its institutions and policies in order to prepare for enlargement .    3.7417317976357984
the next step , i . e . institutional reform , will be taken following the inauguration of the new intergovernmental conference , in which the european parliament will be fully involved .    4.730921643287077
our responsibility as members of the european parliament is to ensure that the process of enlargement takes place in an climate of optimum openness and transparency so that , when the time comes , the citizens of the european union and the citizens of the czech republic will approve the accession of the czech republic to the european union through their elected representatives .    4.0945107037351605
mr president , it gives me great pleasure to give you the floor .    3.185896487053583
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
mr president , allow me , on behalf of the european parliament , to extend our UNK thanks for the clear message which you have brought and of which the members have already shown their appreciation .    4.045768115413872
thank you . you are right to remind us that a national identity is perfectly compatible with a european identity .    3.579569701342989
and you have used your personal experience to show us that your european identity was not UNK ; it was a spontaneous and natural move .    3.658839972855456
i have taken note of your words ; this is something which we all feel very deeply .    3.3846282965515857
you reminded us of your speech in 1994 , which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative , but there is such a thing as creative UNK and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come .    4.109231288341905
and you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society , the importance of the civil society , not just in the candidate countries , but in all the countries in the european union , in restoring our citizens ' confidence , in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need .    4.449224087007851
to summarise , perhaps what struck me most in your speech ; above all , you wished to remind us that , beyond its economic aspects , the task of constructing europe is a spiritual one .    3.466326745398933
we of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you .    3.111670599189301
thank you , mr president .    2.4711788802845525
( the formal sitting was closed at 12 . 40 p . m . )    2.6430652671951966
acp - eu joint assembly    3.987965457292359
the next item is the annual report ( a5 - 0032 / 2000 ) by mr corrie , on behalf of the committee on development and cooperation , on the results of the activities of the UNK - eu joint assembly in 1999 .    2.99750610237784
, rapporteur . - mr president , i had hoped to be rising at 9 a . m . , not 9 p . m . , to present this report .    3.5075425359370844
i hope the number of members in this chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work .    3.911943194367629
however , it is normal practice that the report on the work of the acp - eu joint assembly is put before members of this parliament and i have the pleasant task of doing that tonight .    3.799237716705339
once again , i can report two highly successful assemblies having taken place , one in strasbourg and one in nassau .    3.7146346342393697
in many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one .    4.029086529467499
the acp - eu joint assembly is a unique organisation in world politics .    2.668676834884665
where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern ?    3.2091682146542038
the strasbourg assembly was the last chaired by lord plumb .    3.179290854332095
in honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the joint bureau in nassau made him an honorary president , and we wish him well in his retirement .    3.3451266807322795
the two assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the lomé convention and i look forward to the signature of a new convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned .    3.6229395770577075
i remember that at the last mid - term review , when i was rapporteur , the then commissioner UNK said that review would be the last .    3.8283379405893863
well , he was wrong , and i pay tribute to UNK UNK and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new convention in very difficult circumstances .    4.199272305218808
i was also delighted to hear the report this morning from commissioner nielson who has worked UNK to get the right outcome to the negotiations .    3.586936580491123
i pay special tribute to him for his success .    3.34872757423399
i also pay tribute to mrs kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of lomé .    3.7726410522851084
i am quite sure that mrs kinnock ' s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations .    3.9176191251378634
i also thank the working groups on the small island states and climate change and the follow - up group on fisheries for their excellent reports .    3.2390244606536216
we have had question times to the council and the commission and to the acp council , and i would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work .    4.063720676741649
the main thrust of our work in both assemblies was poverty eradication .    3.3026303485370296
the resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights .    3.680092736512076
it also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as i travel through africa and see the work done by women i only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts .    3.1487958585832114
we might then see an end to some of the fraud , corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped .    4.079122918192191
we had , as usual , many debates on countries where there are war situations .    3.334020053439065
i visited ethiopia and eritrea to gain first - hand knowledge .    3.06413534117105
the oau is doing its best to UNK a peace deal there .    3.861734758063356
we were delighted to hear in nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with south africa after four years of negotiations .    3.2108244172862404
this highlights the problems of coherence between the eu and the developing nations , which came to a head at the wto talks in seattle .    3.7499013612998646
much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free - trade agreements .    3.899039489133338
in nassau , we had two interesting debates on east timor and cuba .    3.6989076152582
cuba has observer status but i understand has now shown a wish to join the acp .    3.3646957392157524
all nations from within the confines of the acp territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy , human rights , governance and an independent judiciary are , i am sure , welcome .    4.359848352975203
when mr dalmau , the cuban UNK minister for foreign affairs addressed the assembly , he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known .    2.974006682514328
on east timor , mr da costa , from the timorese national resistance council , gave a very moving address indicating that east timor would also like to join the acp when it becomes a state with a government .    3.4314237507938183
we must give them all our support to reach that goal .    3.1892516731041187
i had the honour of being elected the european co - president at the beginning of this fifth term and mr UNK from UNK is the new acp co - president .    3.8954074678511637
i would like to see a number of changes to our assembly , particularly after the signing of the new convention in may .    3.6890450479464807
firstly , i would like to see a joint parliamentary assembly of elected members from acp countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates .    2.857185454946772
this i think is the new convention .    4.335123528866338
secondly , the new convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions , which would allow us to be much more specific in our work .    3.735701578267019
these assemblies would report back to the joint assembly .    3.9548706290716584
we had a regional debate in nassau in the caribbean and this was extremely productive .    3.681128587720137
we are going to have one in UNK in west africa too .    3.492062125453137
i want the assembly to stop being just a talk - shop and become a work - shop for the UNK of all the people in developing countries .    3.6746118761083846
i want to see civil society given a UNK voice .    3.2503762854522784
but to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head - on .    4.563016651283269
we must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance .    3.5450776336332224
equally , we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose UNK do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand .    3.884038638708871
i am delighted to see the result in zimbabwe .    3.081281767289802
european taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used .    3.255932184040572
a new wind of change must blow through africa and new standards must be set and lived up to .    3.049748012547636
the joint assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance , human rights and democracy in cooperation with the commission .    3.4203333029534253
i beg to move acceptance of this report .    3.2515747939966086
mr president , let me begin by congratulating mr corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report .    3.0112187042740652
our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty .    4.02132884684754
but there is a UNK contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many member states and in the eu .    3.603157401121738
with regard to financing , we must look to the future and provide the joint assembly with additional funds so that , for instance , we can send delegations to the acp states to UNK electoral processes , at their invitation .    4.274610401778334
in future , the eu must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and , furthermore , must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively .    3.967560642332394
an example here could be the field of education , which will deserve and need special support in the acp states in future .    4.330163499068671
for instance , the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries , which at present still have modest resources , to move towards a global approach , as opposed to globalisation .    3.5003136252204294
i see it as a future task of the eu to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium - sized enterprises in the acp states , which can promote self - help .    4.505397329995679
an example here is the problem in nigeria , which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers .    3.301784456239709
it will be easier to take account of the developing countries ' very diverse problems , and eu aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if , as the report makes quite clear , we take the urgently needed step of UNK our working methods , by introducing the proposed regional assemblies .    3.6508855143505676
thank you , mr UNK : if i am informed correctly , this is the first time you are addressing this house .    3.9244657595165697
congratulations on your maiden speech : it went really well .    3.231252557586046
mr president , it cannot be repeated often enough : since 1975 , the lomé convention has constituted an important pillar of european development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects .    3.3117450495954355
based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality , and on parliamentary control by the joint assembly , it is an example to the world .    5.522376706287915
most appropriately , given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under lomé , we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement , which also UNK the joint assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides .    3.984439013825767
so i do not want to look back only to the year 1999 .    4.317675545147176
much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s .    3.7080551067684135
they also had strong repercussions in the developing countries .    3.0036012454502616
the after - shocks can still be felt .    3.3401860274625594
acp cooperation is a dynamic process .    3.422880759817018
the content of the agreements has progressed steadily between lomé i and lomé vi .    3.0534869788424333
at the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably , now standing at 71 .    3.044657103660734
all those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to namibia and south africa .    3.085579316931561
cuba has just knocked at the door , and , if cuba is also accepted into the acp - eu community , that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in cuba itself .    3.9470183905600327
so acp cooperation remains very exciting , and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new convention .    4.8709205034928695
the history of the joint assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction .    3.628557011756016
in the past , the representatives of the acp countries tended to be government members , government officials or ambassadors ; but today at least three quarters of the acp delegates are elected members of parliament .    3.451588137953714
we ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100 % in the near future , which is indeed what the new convention is aiming at .    3.8557021811312313
unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which , unlike the various crises that arise , largely pass unnoticed .    3.123711537867251
one special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the acp states is regional cooperation and integration .    3.961206002152624
for the same reason the european parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision - making processes and in cooperation management , and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation .    3.6872476787433026
the enhanced contacts between the joint assembly and the social partners provided for in the new convention are another step in the right direction .    3.4766416771361217
but i am a little sad that the european development fund has still not been incorporated in the community budget .    3.9875323354923244
i hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too .    3.2235013845728204
mr president , i congratulate mr corrie on his report .    2.4328333540929754
the lomé convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the eu and the acp countries for over 25 years .    3.5000296284258816
that it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters , including the wto , is a triumph of sorts .    4.160252486474811
but of course the new convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the eu commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets .    4.424883812893371
measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements . for example , the agreement is particularly disappointing for those acp countries suffering from short - term fluctuations in export earnings .    3.959802779922657
during a UNK negotiating session in december a compromise was reached which provided that , in respect of least - developed , landlocked and island states , assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2 % loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10 % for the other acp states .    3.7932986784629548
but at the final negotiating session the eu claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2 % threshold .    3.479864212568007
this change has been devastating for the windward islands in particular which may be the only acp state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements .    3.3809184728526906
this seems a particularly perverse outcome since the windward islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the acp states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new lomé arrangement .    3.9815235534617406
non - least - developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements .    3.33561850148988
yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the UNK winds of free trade without UNK their own domestic economy .    3.692969344830107
we need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the acp are pursued in their own right .    3.1859373616838553
finally , during any new trade round the eu and the acp states should press jointly for a reform of gatt article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non - reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically UNK groups of countries .    3.1775723722712685
the lomé convention is a unique partnership ; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of lomé and involve a participation of the wto and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora .    3.9399922312500593
mr president , what i want to do in this debate is condemn the fate reserved for the poor countries of africa , the caribbean and the pacific .    3.444292656535268
people have the UNK to say they benefit from the lomé convention , but even looking at trading relations alone , the lomé convention has done nothing to protect those countries ; their already UNK share in trade with europe has been UNK .    3.670043077537111
that reflects the growth of inequality between eu and acp countries .    3.0891004191104217
the lomé convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial UNK , which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence , notably on the former colonial powers .    3.2948041856543453
when it comes to so - called development aid , given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better , development is clearly not what the aid is for , even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for european manufacturers .    4.100488211077563
the aid is primarily a UNK for incumbent regimes , and the poor majority does not benefit at all .    4.258149192169985
even if it were properly UNK this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care , education or drinking water supply .    3.870967309251848
for some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid , and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption .    4.067676242164557
after all , who protects these deeply corrupt regimes , if not the governments of the rich countries ?    3.4770542691323
they turn a blind eye to the UNK of corruption , the big groups controlling oil , water supply , or public works . they could UNK down on them since their head offices are here in europe .    3.554643061939103
the debate about either extending the lomé convention with its quotas and protectionism , or , instead , gradually UNK down the special relationship between the european union and the acp countries in the name of free trade , is a UNK debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and UNK of those countries .    3.7933989107467556
i protest against an UNK and UNK organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a UNK death to enrich a minority .    3.861494569699679
a mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty , but , until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups , we are just covering up the real problems .    3.7886594998822525
mr president , i want to thank the co - president of the joint acp - eu assembly , mr corrie . it was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the acp - eu assembly .    3.552309417080381
in this speech , i will confine myself to addressing certain points i consider fundamental .    3.429933529909993
i believe the european parliament should call for the assembly to become truly parliamentary , urging all acp countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives , so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric .    3.747898616119472
my next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the wto , which is seen by the acp countries as an enormous danger to their development .    4.431249865714614
i do believe the acp countries need a transition period , but they also need support in the context of the new logic of UNK of aid , not only in agriculture and fisheries , but also in the exploitation of UNK and underground resources , some of which are being exploited , with slim economic returns to the acp countries themselves .    4.73225203045421
thirdly , the european parliament - through a joint working group within the joint assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in acp countries ' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and , above all , social development , and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the acp countries .    3.8131191953897785
we must put the people of the acp countries first in our relationship with their rulers , who need to be fully aware that development aid from the european union is intended for the people and not for the UNK that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries .    4.49188187000526
fourthly , and finally , the prevention of inter - ethnic conflicts between states must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals i have set out .    3.736252799745589
mr president , i agree with the positive evaluation mrs UNK has just made and i want to add that mr corrie has started his term as co - president of the acp - eu joint assembly with effective and UNK work deserving of our full appreciation .    3.195476151328551
i shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago , partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here .    3.5683254342556894
i refer to cuba ' s expression of intent , of 2 february , to become a full member of the acp group of countries .    3.8084852137205014
a cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the acp - eu joint assembly in nassau , and vice - chancellor dalmau spoke in the plenary session , engaging in a lively debate , and afterwards held conversations with many of us .    3.164839643511667
following nassau , a delegation from parliament led by mr corrie and the chairman of the committee on development and cooperation , UNK UNK , visited havana and a series of very UNK exchanges of opinion took place .    3.5242572257773883
it is my impression that this mission from the european parliament was the final push which convinced our cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the european union .    3.49878521098598
we are witnessing events of great political significance and i hope that we in the european parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the union , so that cuba ' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible .    3.9239011554941303
that is important , for at least three reasons .    3.336403926416401
first , it is important for cuba , to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the united states blockade , which has been repeatedly condemned by the european parliament and the united nations .    4.581144074840556
secondly , we must bear in mind that cuba ' s application has the support of all the acp countries .    3.6986085987178017
if the european union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates , we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them .    3.933322429941853
nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the european union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter .    3.9305791572593587
by accepting cuba into the acp community we will be demonstrating that our europe is not involved in the shameful process of ' playing but not paying ' , and that , when we get indignant about UNK like the UNK - UNK act , we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences .    4.414273216097438
the acp - eu joint assembly meets again in a few weeks time and i am sure this subject will be dealt with there .    3.8983830476051673
ideally the european parliament ' s representatives should be able to support cuba ' s intent at those proceedings , as our parliamentary colleagues from the acp countries will no doubt be doing .    4.01895499769066
of course , cuba must meet all the standard conditions , just like any other member .    3.4580250345158445
the cubans know that and i am sure they accept it .    4.0125692959313914
it must also be made clear that cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners .    3.80160550766461
cuba ' s wish to join is welcome and cuba will be welcome in our circle .    3.450083165469085
i say that wholeheartedly , but also with the deep conviction that , just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and , as a consequence of that , extreme tension and a UNK of the cuban position , the integration we are supporting here , and the prosperity it will produce , will translate into the UNK and openness we all seek and from which all of us , especially the cuban people , will benefit .    4.256431527835559
mr president , i also want to begin by thanking and congratulating the rapporteur , mr corrie , for an excellent report which i think very well describes and UNK the work which has been done in the acp - eu joint assembly in the course of 1999 .    4.066023823053272
i do not have very long in which to speak , and i really only want to take up two questions .    4.434402006249038
the first is about the fight against poverty , which i think is becoming an embarrassment both for the eu and the member states .    4.011572795309185
in spite of the fact that , both in the treaty and at the un ' s meetings in rio and copenhagen , there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world , the budget for development aid is , in actual fact , being cut back , when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen .    4.083031481466621
we must put a stop to this trend .    2.712764098642795
we must begin by writing off debts . we must follow up words with action .    3.170593418910708
i should like us to take a leading role in this work .    3.4007017559797523
my second question concerns the fact that , in many contexts , we talk about the acp countries having to learn the principles of democracy .    3.7414745798464244
the acp countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion .    4.287064671292253
i think that is a very good idea indeed , and i fully subscribe to it .    4.48829881915349
however , we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements .    2.947196021116746
how do these operate within the european parliament ' s delegation to the acp - eu ' s joint assembly ?    4.821933630863602
in contrast to how things are done here in the european parliament and in parliament ' s committees , where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports , there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the joint assembly . the two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves .    3.589844783106594
in order to change this undemocratic arrangement , we , the group of the greens / european free alliance , have tabled amendment no 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents , together with the members of working parties , should be appointed in accordance with clear , democratic rules .    3.6879956309367707
in this context , account ought to be taken of the smaller groups , and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements .    3.3012276279500288
mr president , commissioner , firstly , i too would like to congratulate mr corrie on the quality of his report , which appropriately reflects the UNK of the debates in the joint assembly he so effectively co - chaired .    3.4608855516505024
the eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim , to whit , preferential agreements between the european union and the acp countries within the framework of the lomé conventions .    3.610376512426378
the challenge was immense .    3.113235440970387
globalisation , free trade , and the UNK of the wto with its UNK philosophy , were UNK the very essence of the north - south dialogue .    4.365326630028339
so we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development , and personally i am convinced that the work of the last joint assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations , as did the new climate created by the events at seattle .    3.919920759324265
however , while i welcome the renewal of the agreements , what i find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close .    3.662341014563034
the european union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old UNK , or frankly neo - UNK , logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons , following a formula our friend michel rocard is so keen on .    3.3009936240661286
the union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners .    3.6094903600054997
by refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool , in the hands of technocrats , for imposing new sets of conditions , the european union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty .    4.65843273615525
we have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events .    3.078802481115754
what right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history , values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own ?    3.350537899846101
personally , i prefer the willingness that is clearly UNK up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents - local authorities , non - governmental organisations - which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can UNK achieve ownership cooperation .    3.7093074633114274
in short , this is the only way they can emerge from UNK and UNK dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves , the proof of success .    3.937652785615055
the european parliament ' s opinion on the activities of the acp - european union joint assembly has always had a major impact , undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the european union in development and cooperation .    3.8612462821504083
the important role of the increasingly parliamentary joint assembly in strengthening relations between the european union and the acp countries needs to be stressed .    4.090561286954785
in view of this positive action , there is every advantage to be gained from according the joint assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work .    3.7718750226369835
we back the rapporteur ' s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies , under the aegis of the joint assembly , in the six regions of the convention : the caribbean , the pacific and four african regions .    4.046674648599115
these regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas .    3.4798123068669096
poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the joint assembly and its eradication is the priority for the european union ' s development policy .    3.656891456258893
in line with the resolution at the nassau meeting , we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community .    3.5728739932262727
consistency and action are needed .    3.889019657413082
the next lomé convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies .    3.122921358225475
the participation of local bodies is absolutely essential .    3.2139756859232267
in a wider context , the priorities , as i see it , are to UNK poor countries ' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development , as well as control of fraud and corruption .    3.740041184576344
we need to make progress with concrete and consistent action .    3.077920536197697
people in the poor countries are beginning to despair .    3.9956985632991224
i call on the commission to act on the rapid accession of east timor to the lomé convention as one means , amongst others , of promoting the eradication of poverty and UNK its economic , cultural and social development , in order to strengthen its internal democratisation .    3.73321624946251
finally , i must congratulate the council presidency on the coming europe - africa summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace , democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of africa .    3.830156177997651
. ( da ) mr president , i should like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report and also to thank the joint assembly for its work in 1999 .    3.6174743066592985
i am also delighted to be able to confirm that i shall be participating in the joint assembly ' s next meeting , which takes place in march in nigeria .    3.7062068494366196
the commission is pleased to see the joint assembly playing a larger role , especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development .    4.02305207467752
in order to be able to develop , the countries concerned must , however , become actively involved in the global economic system .    4.200118450403979
with regard to trade with our partners in development , the commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the acp countries ' special economic and social limitations .    4.563853623708009
mrs lucas mentioned that the UNK and UNK system ought to be continued with .    4.6051933744384925
i do not agree .    2.9778614273250876
that system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is , in actual fact , of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned .    3.575048296260548
it operates too slowly , and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future , because this will operate more flexibly .    4.74151898037243
regarding the future accession of countries such as east timor to the lomé convention , i can only repeat what i recently said to the european parliament ' s committee on development and cooperation , namely , that the door is open .    3.8387901840914216
it is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door .    3.375439174351109
once they have done so , we shall adopt a position on the matter .    4.385531751573965
with regard to cuba ' s application for accession to the lomé convention , the commission notes that , according to their recent declaration , the acp states support cuba ' s application .    3.824362498147832
the eu has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards cuba , as outlined in the eu ' s common position , but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex .    3.98031927148599
with regard to the UNK d ' UNK , i can inform you that the whole of the eur 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities .    4.428230513243823
with regard to financing the european development fund by an amount in excess of the budget , i can say that this is being considered .    4.037345227830428
for its part , the commission supports this , but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the UNK and UNK .    4.387991638668286
concerning article UNK , i can say that , during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement , a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed .    4.137167981019187
it is now the case , following adoption of the amsterdam treaty , that parliament wishes , on the basis of article 300 , to be kept fully informed of all decisions , and the commission will continue to take account of parliament ' s decisions on this subject .    4.756814486824737
there are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in parliament in connection with such decisions .    3.4652120045562
this would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted amsterdam treaty .    3.288017878033787
finally , i would refer to the south africa agreement , which the rapporteur also touched upon .    4.078100854053767
in this regard , i am simply pleased - delighted , in fact - here this evening , as a conclusion to this debate , to be able , very appropriately , to inform you that south africa ' s president has today said yes to the solution which the eu ' s council of foreign ministers last monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding south africa .    4.124929520806141
so the " UNK war " is over .    3.348496252860137
peace has broken out , and we can now look forward to cooperation with south africa in accordance with the common UNK and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start .    4.317851433053847
i think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has , on the whole , been quite positive , and i would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the third world on precisely the work in question .    3.9412428793101997
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p . m .    1.5924185258399082
stabilisation and association agreement with fyrom    3.954482614509325
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0031 / 2000 ) by mr swoboda , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the recommendation for a council decision authorising the commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with fyrom ( sec ( 1999 ) 1279 - c5 - 0166 / 1999 - 1999 / 2121 ( cos ) .    2.1448566781778595
mr president , commissioner patten , today we are discussing a country that really has suffered hard times , a country that is , however , moving in a very promising direction , thanks to its own efforts and resolve and certainly also thanks to the support of the international community .    4.0637774300019265
so if the european union , the council and the commission are proposing - and i assume that parliament will support that proposal tomorrow - the first stabilisation and association agreement in south - eastern europe , in the balkan region - i am quite happy to use that term - it is primarily in gratitude for or acknowledgement of the fact that fyrom itself has worked its way into a good position , in economic and , of course , mainly in political terms , in face of the war in the neighbouring region and also in relation to its own minority .    4.503463140211743
for it is no small thing to have a minority of 33 % or even 35 % in one ' s own country .    4.01287780825696
that country and its politicians - no doubt with some differences here and there - have always done very good work , and we should recognise that .    3.85566943309656
the commission is proposing that we should conclude an agreement jointly with the council .    3.5343077147032957
firstly , there is the regional approach .    3.437888495486665
i believe that if it is understood properly , the regional approach is both important and necessary .    3.343186786987409
there has to be a willingness to cooperate .    4.273540096485725
provided it is not seen as some kind of constraint but as a willingness to cooperate , as an opportunity that each country should grasp , then this is the right approach .    4.6869375503402555
the problem is that , when we look at fyrom , we can see how very difficult it is to cooperate economically with some neighbouring countries , such as kosovo and albania , or to cooperate politically with , for instance , yugoslavia .    3.9428028875342007
on the other hand , cooperation with bulgaria , and in particular with greece , has made good progress and i think we should acknowledge that too .    3.407292824973858
in this context , the european union must consider , as it began to do early this week , how to include the neighbouring yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything , i . e . without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime .    3.8576263255159655
tomorrow morning i will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while UNK them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation .    3.8045638547825655
in that regard allow me to say , since i come from a country through which the danube flows , that i am grateful that the commission , i . e . commissioner patten and also vice - president palacio , with whom i was recently in budapest , is considering opening the danube to shipping again . that would provide for a UNK of economic recovery in this region too , which , of course , would be of particular importance to romania .    4.483084693379591
in my view , this regional approach , provided it is understood correctly , i . e . as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself , is in fact the right one to adopt .    3.707007816005238
as i said , it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition .    3.2394736065984255
secondly , let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer fyrom accession to the european union .    3.699587743187588
in our view , it would be an illusion to think there was any point in fyrom applying for accession right now , but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date .    3.512797531699962
fyrom wants to be told here and now that , in principle , accession will be possible when the time is right .    4.681653345710359
this country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined .    4.888046172975354
it sees , in the whole UNK of aid instruments , a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards europe but that this train will continue through europe while leaving fyrom on a UNK .    4.1213451108855494
i think commissioner patten understands that too .    2.990602570737299
so i very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks .    3.9600577212357617
thirdly , i believe that , so far at least , fyrom has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly .    4.380023767726862
even though there will of course be UNK here , fyrom will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in brussels today can in future be handled in skopje , in the country itself .    4.181247196308348
i hope that the honourable members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards fyrom .    3.7190058256071064
mr president , since the start of the yugoslav wars , the republic of macedonia - i prefer to use this UNK - has behaved as a constructive peace - keeper .    3.319619530291427
we would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of macedonia and bosnia and herzegovina at the time , which had non - violent liberalisation and a non - violent separation from the yugoslav federal structure in view .    3.8047320386670718
as you can see , our macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that macedonia is not just a UNK in our so - called strive towards stability , but actually took the initiative .    4.0208199980401025
the former president , mr UNK , can take special credit for this , and the current president too has already adopted the profile of president of all macedonian citizens , so much so that the european union should only be grateful to have him as UNK in the balkans .    4.28379711724744
despite the obvious reasons for any internal tension , both population groups have struck a reasonable modus vivendi and the outlook for reaching a sound solution to the remaining problems is good .    3.1014902605750336
i was UNK to hearing this type of comment about the roma in europe .    3.5122094704067024
with regard to the problems afflicting macedonia , higher education for the albanian - speaking citizens deserves our special attention .    3.0877687772096616
accessible higher education , with which you have a certain affinity , is an important instrument in the UNK of population groups . i am speaking from personal experience as someone who attended the protestant university in amsterdam .    4.563799141160581
i might never have studied otherwise .    3.118283633928723
such an affinity and this type of higher education is also important in the development of the constitutional state and for the aptly termed mainstream society which needs to be strengthened in countries like this .    4.209656266988198
the agreement with macedonia should partly compensate for the damage which this country incurred following the boycott we instituted against serbia , which is at no cost to us but costs serbia ' s neighbouring states all the more .    3.4252936899659883
it would be beneficial if we could UNK this , especially vis - à - vis the neighbouring states .    2.9067936511211165
it is only fair that we should regulate aid to macedonia properly now .    3.4469726290088496
we are therefore quite prepared to support the liberals ' amendment to keep aid independent from the donor states ' interests , for we need to give industry in macedonia and the region the best possible opportunities with the aid money available for reconstruction .    3.546166255421755
i am more than happy to include bulgaria and romania in this , as it seems to me a tactical and psychological error only to talk about the five countries of former yugoslavia , plus albania .    3.310703671486959
it is important to us that the economies in the region can stand on their own two feet again , which can quite easily be done with the aid money .    3.679272008041007
the agreement with macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the european union , allowing this country to join , even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future .    4.016322850929777
i would quote the phare programme as an example .    3.0610561792262114
mr president , the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the greek UNK surrounding it .    3.8647819311213207
i assume that the member states will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic .    3.8773639562058095
if certain countries wish to use the words " former yugoslavia " , then that is their business ; others need not feel obliged to copy them .    3.3214163832293644
hence my support for the sound report by mr swoboda ; we have come to expect nothing less of him , and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected republic of macedonia .    3.71271724271551
mr president , let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of mr swoboda ' s work as rapporteur .    3.38139310473632
today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the european union and the republic of macedonia .    3.5017096019220366
we do so in the awareness that this decision , the very first relating to that area , is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the balkans .    4.080610036308512
this new phase , or rather policy , identifies the prospect of integrating the region into europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully .    3.3726834193447113
our agreement to the negotiations , as set out in the rapporteur ' s explanatory statement , is born of the conviction that it is right for union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire .    3.6018819772686403
this is the dual objective which i believe should be pursued . on the one hand , we must maintain programmes on , for example , infrastructure , preparations - still premature - for free trade , and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area , and on the other , it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia as an example of the policy .    4.279074419117325
and there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive .    3.8561679104599778
as we were able to ascertain during our missions to skopje , there has been considerable progress in the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , as regards the economy , movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the balkans - multi - ethnic coexistence .    3.6785906705821314
on the other hand , the price macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring kosovo is very high , both in terms of UNK availability of nato forces and in terms of reduced exports to northern europe .    3.5560681308568833
mr president , commissioner , i rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .    2.7356712222118786
we are extremely UNK that , along the lines set out by the rapporteur , mr swoboda , this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries , especially albania , bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , montenegro and kosovo and , as soon as possible , serbia .    3.6208365634616335
we are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence , with all the consequences of that in terms of continental , if not world , instability .    3.783965709516664
if the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the union to the countries of eastern europe , that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with albania and the countries of former yugoslavia . and that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south - east europe that the agreements we are discussing represent .    3.883382954023979
it is in that quasi - provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south - east europe from foreign affairs to enlargement .    3.467471225398626
very rapid and direct involvement of south - east europe in the life of the european institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the european parliament , and that staff from those countries could work in the court of justice and the commission .    4.346110002296911
but if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market - based economy is to be encouraged , we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development .    4.157164238159883
with this in mind , we have presented some amendments which i hope parliament will accept .    4.135437341531348
first , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the european union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by macedonia to european products , on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of macedonia is accepted .    3.291778810716594
thirdly , world aid and assistance coming into the region , and hence into macedonia as well , should be clearly multilateral , and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country .    3.6936699722417603
i am referring to the future constitutional state of kosovo , the need to involve serbia in the region ' s reconciliation process and - why not ? - new discussions on relations between the european union , nato and the un , in the light of the new balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty , which i think calls for a change in the existing un charter .    4.132491527730653
mr president , commissioner , the war in kosovo has knocked everything off balance .    2.676776804413119
this is certainly true for the relations between the european union and the western balkans .    3.190079954530561
since then , expectations have been high .    2.925269584718498
this applies to them and us .    3.2699958777457336
this is true on their part because - whether we like it or not - they are asking us for direct aid and they are wondering what europe wants from them at the end of the day ?    3.287318154893352
is there any prospect of membership ?    3.151498225256167
this is very much on their minds .    2.99195622572713
but here too , within the european union , expectations are high .    4.307886587095309
if we do things properly , this may well be a first UNK of a genuine common foreign and security policy .    3.353042268923544
will the union manage to display a united front and develop a common policy , for the first time , concerning such a difficult regulation ?    3.354916448264802
it also remains to be seen whether the european union has learnt any lessons from the bad experiences in bosnia when it comes to providing aid and the slightly better experiences in kosovo .    3.246516396385713
against this background of extremely high expectations , i do not think that i am UNK if i say that this first step , namely the stability and association agreement with macedonia , is vitally important .    3.883753777929867
this is not the union ' s only contribution .    3.7728521455500528
the debate on the stability pact , the debate on the UNK programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending .    4.378251896230886
we are now dealing with the stabilisation and association agreements , that is to say a medium - term issue .    3.608566048621946
i am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen .    3.403584809938967
what does the european union intend to do with macedonia ?    5.141964807531373
will it do the same to us ?    3.6096472534719313
this first step is so important because of this model function .    4.340982066657211
macedonia also serves as a model for another reason .    3.0710614305729416
the rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms , namely , the issue of UNK relations .    3.472848498217789
there is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture .    2.8690005451540768
during the presidential elections , it appeared that things were not running too smoothly , but compared to the rest of the region , macedonia could serve as a model .    3.4081480377353963
we would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western balkans with the help of the macedonians .    3.3797055175992927
this model function also applies to regional cooperation .    3.8269639421364614
i could not agree more with the rapporteur : a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards bulgaria and greece , and not cutting them off on the other .    3.623223936138755
mr president , commissioner , if we manage this first step successfully , we will have gained a great deal .    3.8904700761925586
if we mess it up , then we will have lost a great deal more .    3.76477737770537
i just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to macedonia and the effectiveness of eu financial and other support .    4.437018109946477
i am referring to the sanctions against yugoslavia .    2.6923361140754807
do not misunderstand me : i too believe that we need to take effective action against the milosevic regime .    3.5416157359561034
but firstly , these sanctions have a far - reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too , including macedonia , which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is .    3.909873991257628
secondly , the entire population of yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of milosevic and his circle , which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive .    3.7892791757661044
so i believe that we should take today ' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions , as stated in amendment no 10 .    4.094691859654868
mr president , we did not need to witness the end the kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that , after various wars in the territory of the former yugoslavia , with their UNK negative effects on the stability of the balkans , a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed , aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south - east europe .    3.6649390844972345
the european union ' s contribution under the stability pact , now converted into what is called the " stabilisation and association process " , represents a development in the regional concept the european community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region : bosnia and herzegovina , croatia , the federal republic of yugoslavia , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and albania . its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the dayton peace agreement , and it should therefore contribute to regional stability .    3.507870308348736
so establishing relations between the european union and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia on a completely new basis , and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the european union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process , constitutes an important contribution to stability in the balkans .    3.2293907354276565
the expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day , maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course .    4.255068039050596
we are not UNK ourselves by believing that , once agreement is obtained , the mandate we are giving the commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long - suffering region , where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development .    3.8128791516460163
they have suffered enough , first under the soviet UNK and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc .    3.322750308430808
the evidence is that the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the european union , going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 june 1998 , which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire , especially in key areas of the internal market .    3.74311528063256
it is true that the former yugoslav republic of macedonia still has a long way to go , but , given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement , and with transitional periods accepted for certain UNK , the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement .    3.9273161530112564
we share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region , we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed , emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the european union , and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south - east europe , and that the issue is how the balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability .    4.25972567083572
the various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context .    3.6266889483548796
this agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region .    3.8808364707978034
that is why it is so important .    2.4686620433181448
the point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the european union to draw closer to these countries .    3.690876505546603
we are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation , that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments , and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone , but they are all countries which now know that , once they have overcome their difficulties , a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the european union .    3.8890576308191704
mr president , commissioner , i am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow members .    2.8435495366717443
i think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy .    3.5070760466443636
paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example .    3.4804663757416052
we know there are 13 applicant countries , from lithuania to turkey , and just one black hole in europe , the balkans , but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants , we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle .    4.571454266620725
paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status .    2.837773446616758
but this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy , it is also an UNK , because , if negotiations begin tomorrow , this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years .    4.268734332047725
and i UNK you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from croatia , macedonia and bosnia , amongst the balkan countries , three years hence .    3.328429459177322
a few days ago mr UNK announced that croatia ' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000 .    3.0438570426823155
there are bound to be other applications and this great work , this fine intellectual architecture , will UNK , left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former yugoslavia for the past 20 years .    3.6043975086272013
this would not be so serious if this region of europe were not so UNK by the problems we are all aware of , problems which are being addressed , but which have not yet been resolved , by the new government of macedonia . there are the problems of coexistence between the macedonian majority and the albanian minority , the connected problems of kosovo , the notorious economic problems , the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in serbia , and then there is the problem of the greek veto which must be condemned for what it is .    4.424476337272576
after nearly 10 years , greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name , and i hope the interpreters have not used the term fyrom when i have been saying macedonia .    4.060262016339051
it is absolutely absurd . apart from anything else it is offensive , in my opinion , to the greek meps and the citizens of greece .    3.7759581990180804
this question needs to be resolved urgently .    4.30751675555903
finally , by happy chance , a letter from mr georgievski , president of macedonia to mr fischler , dated 8 march , has come into my hands . in it , referring to article o , now article 49 of the treaty , he asks if macedonia can join the european union .    3.436230311293547
why has the council not informed us of this ?    2.9521317980097455
why has the commission not informed us of this formal request from macedonia ?    3.090766960740483
mr president , commissioner , the balkans are not purely a dark UNK , politically speaking .    2.867184941795324
the decidedly positive developments in the republic of macedonia over the past critical years speak for themselves .    3.6410661640923117
the gruesome UNK of ethnic violence in neighbouring kosovo did not reach its territory .    3.2011017110213884
paradoxically , but truly , the war in kosovo UNK generated exactly the opposite effect : the UNK gap of confidence between the macedonian majority and the albanian minority became decidedly smaller .    3.086431980968227
from the point of view of the macedonian majority , the albanian minority behaved UNK towards the common state during the international explosion of the kosovo conflict .    3.0206029118765274
in the eyes of the albanian minority , the macedonians and the macedonian state have more than met their neighbourly obligations in respect of kosovo ' s albanian majority who were persecuted to the extreme .    3.051239252696242
this remarkable upshot of the kosovar war negotiations can therefore justifiably be seen as the internal , political establishment of the republic of macedonia the second time round .    3.433746407885561
mr swoboda ' s well - balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level .    3.020979768906231
in brief , the european union knows what to do in macedonia : to help this local port of refuge - recently used by scores of war refugees - to fulfil its role properly as a catalyst for the planned stability pact in the balkans .    3.5031569322843894
mr president , as one who has been concerned with macedonia for eight years , i have to contradict mr dupuis .    3.3063120285453222
what we are doing here is not hypocritical .    2.7750734985329735
we have reached a UNK moment and i think the macedonians are glad about it .    3.6035232703449798
please stop being so unpleasant and UNK cold water on everything .    3.033076576851277
i think we should take a more positive approach here .    3.1699327715237158
macedonia did not go through a war .    3.6183727572008406
but it suffered from the war in its vicinity and from the sanctions , as it is still suffering from the sanctions that were rightly imposed on the neighbouring countries .    3.7933522439862264
so we must admit that developments in macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines .    2.8366650639579865
this is a country that has difficult inter - ethnic problems to deal with at home , and is resolving them with increasing success .    3.7502822050577636
let me emphasise that we can congratulate macedonia on its exemplary legislation on ethnic minorities and the way it applies it and that the consistent policy of integrating the 30 % of ethnic albanians in government activity , in government policy and in society , is a precondition for peaceful coexistence in macedonia .    3.90585038116418
i am glad to see that the hope mr swoboda expressed in his report will be fulfilled early in march , i . e . that we will finally have an eu delegation there and that we , as the european union , will finally have a greater role to play there .    4.073415180736661
i believe that the opening of these negotiations on the stability and association process is the logical conclusion of a salutary and positive trend in that country .    3.707311620706678
as a sign of our political commitment , we must finally show macedonia in practice that we are indeed UNK its own welcome regional cooperation by genuinely embarking on regional projects .    3.9754529205027653
let me name just two small ones : the rapid resolution of the problem of the frontier crossing with kosovo in UNK and the creation of UNK 8 , from albania via macedonia to bulgaria .    3.5526196381862523
i think mr swoboda has drafted an excellent report , and it has my wholehearted support .    3.661306645632112
mr president , i too would like to compliment mr swoboda on his report .    2.4334328726560983
the report UNK stability in the region in a structural manner . this is also the purpose of the pending agreement with the republic of macedonia which we are debating today .    4.276370440622252
although the actual implementation of the stability pact has not yet started , the commission has already developed the new instrument , entitled the stabilisation and association agreement .    3.899180355194652
this marks the beginning of the treaty - based stabilising process for the countries of the former yugoslavia .    4.255905533869047
these countries do not yet qualify for a pre - accession agreement .    3.4357879756944234
the present agreement is a kind of pre - pre - agreement , but with a view to joining in future .    3.888558981292476
the instrument of joining countries together by means of active treaties is excellent , provided that the agreements stipulated in them are implemented UNK , so that the required stabilisation can actually be attained .    3.824307758552898
macedonia remains a potential minefield and has a history to match .    3.4686521670234445
it does , however , have the ambition to break free from this image .    3.4969631708297517
this requires internal stability .    3.1140481847544965
the new government would like to tackle this matter and the agreement could be an agenda for reforms , including a direct role and equality for the albanian minority .    4.045293203686167
more than anything , the country needs peace and quiet now , in order to put its internal house in order and to find the road to greater prosperity .    4.23475120121017
we , the social democrats , would urge the opposition to back these ideas .    3.593195042138757
they need to help support the much - praised macedonian model .    3.165048351819002
but the country also - and especially - needs external stability .    3.191002962935044
what is the point of having internal stability if the surrounding environment is unstable ?    2.9683312008645926
this stability is required in the relations with yugoslavia , kosovo , albania and bulgaria .    3.3179865538723186
the region should recognise that macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist .    4.195212400605477
minorities and majorities need to be given room for human and cultural exchange .    4.136234496612066
macedonia ' s stability is very much linked with the developments in the neighbouring countries .    3.51245865487656
the kosovo problem is well - known and the international community is present there on a massive scale .    3.670997739497078
it seems that the albania factor is being underestimated .    2.7207497429114187
the union considers it untimely to reach a stability and association agreement with this country .    3.4428616488350365
but what then instead ?    3.1069605602476877
it is the very argument to conclude an agreement with macedonia and not yet with albania that cause us so much concern , so much so that a passive stance from the union vis - à - vis albania is really not acceptable .    3.189515648295257
what does the commission intend to do regarding this issue ?    2.9169549697035952
yugoslavia is just as much a weak link in the stability process and , as such , a threat to macedonia ' s stability .    3.4948039761862684
we need to wait and see what happens there .    3.392682357447814
we , however , second the council ' s decision to give the sanctions a different focus .    4.498279295028206
in this way , at least a serious attempt is being made to give the opposition , which is preparing for a new round of demonstrations , a shot in the arm .    4.072248068501067
what else will the union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met ?    3.750975306588788
what else can we do to support this opposition ?    3.972198211541158
mr president , commissioner , kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could UNK minorities in the most UNK way on the grounds that " it is happening within their own nation " .    3.256335735249337
when the usa and nato and , finally , also the eu , reacted , it was already late , in fact very late .    4.710314864297266
a great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the eu , among others , has acted earlier and more decisively .    3.6246528400509406
our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south - east europe to be integrated with other countries in the eu - economically , politically and in terms of trade .    4.302307766156327
fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war - UNK part of europe is best provided through trade and economic integration .    3.7323823985038365
we liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly , just as UNK costa reported .    4.4371864048583305
it is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with macedonia , and we thank mr swoboda for a very good report .    3.9913906736788665
macedonia deserves our support , especially in view of the self - UNK , UNK work which the people and leaders of macedonia undertook during the kosovo war .    4.3747975168145645
now that macedonia is UNK itself loose from the crushing embrace of communism and nationalism , it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms .    3.3100330751628584
we should do exactly the same for the other countries in the balkans .    3.714664851543955
this is an urgent duty for the eu .    3.0731019247018225
mr president , allow me in this context to remind meps - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war , human degradation , murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of yugoslavia , namely serbia .    3.483054114224542
the man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the hague still goes free .    3.001868614653297
i am talking about milosevic .    2.902949394114493
as long as milosevic is still there and serbia is not pursuing a democratic path , serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the balkans , including in macedonia .    3.208026406618849
mr president , the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the stability pact in south - eastern europe ,    3.9044066266253648
its terms , which the swoboda report accepts , are certainly not directed towards peace , but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country , and towards controlling its natural wealth , UNK its workforce and continuing to use that country as a UNK against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order .    3.936049578247159
all this , in exchange for the promise of future accession to the european union .    2.829920348184528
the report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the european union on south - eastern europe .    3.7333151995832212
it is characteristic that the report congratulates fyrom on the constructive stance it maintained during the nato attack , UNK its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for nato forces , but , of course , remains silent about the indignation of its people , which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the nato bombardments .    3.6166388026072447
finally , because we consider that both the stability pact and the stabilisation and association process the european union is implementing in countries in that area , will create new problems there , new UNK for their peoples , and will reinforce the dominant role of the american and european UNK , we will be voting against the report in an expression of our solidarity with the people of fyrom .    4.4494258785170135
mr president , commissioner , one of the most basic aims of the european union ' s stability and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is to establish stability and peace in the area , and this , of course , presupposes developing and maintaining good neighbourly relations between the countries involved .    4.070740147460804
i shall not bother you with details of the problem concerning the name fyrom , which as you must know , is the subject of a difference of opinion with greece and of negotiations between the two countries lasting over four years , under the aegis of the secretary general of the un in the context of related security council resolutions , but also the conventional obligation of the respective parties pursuant to article 5 of the so - termed intermediate agreement of 1995 .    3.888563241909988
i do , however , think it appropriate to say that , at the forthcoming negotiations and with the conclusion of the association agreement , the european side must point out to the skopje government the need for it to show appropriate constructive political will , so that it may contribute positively to a successful outcome of the talks in new york .    4.66071760126301
i should like to hope that such an appeal from europe , with parallel emphasis on the difficulties that any further indecision would create for completing and implementing the association agreement , would be duly heeded and appraised accordingly by the skopje government , so that it can respond appropriately , on the one hand , to greece ' s UNK conciliatory attitude concerning the specific issue , and , on the other hand , to the more general practical , declared intention and UNK of all the partners in the european union , including greece , to facilitate and support fyrom ' s progress towards a united europe .    3.891041589131466
mr president , this is because i do not think that the harmonious day to day relations , contacts and communication between fyrom and greece that have actually been achieved at both UNK and UNK level , and this mainly thanks to the practical arrangements of the intermediate agreement , i repeat , i do not think these sufficiently cover the conditions and criteria of good UNK necessary , inter alia , for negotiating and concluding an association agreement .    3.5073111663745618
on the contrary , i think that this demand can only be considered satisfied by a de UNK full normalisation of fyrom ' s relations with all its neighbours .    3.273150166792191
that , combined with the essential improvement of certain aspects of the internal situation in that country , in the area of minorities and democratic institutions , would round off the image of political maturity which fyrom has , in fact , presented in other respects and which has made our european family welcome closer relations with it .    4.183781318888464
mr president , the agreement we are debating today , as analysed by mr swoboda , which i hope we will adopt tomorrow , constitutes the second politically positive step , after the stability pact for the area .    3.6787168632647793
there is another small step , which is related to the recent partial lifting of the embargo decided by our 15 governments for yugoslavia .    3.479767991505218
for about 10 years , the situation in the area has been fluid .    5.148514893541229
both as an historical period and , in particular , as a political period , 10 years is a very long time .    4.418665311670992
under those conditions , then , there has been a real failure .    4.017781729308455
in that sense , the agreement we will be voting on tomorrow , which contributes towards stability in the area , is de facto a move in the right direction .    3.5898476022151358
in essence , fyrom is a UNK version of the former yugoslavia , regardless of where one or another minority holds UNK .    3.7223118150415186
from that standpoint , the fact that so far it has resisted any UNK from its wider environment is a very positive element and under no circumstances should any of us , any state , any policy or any view , UNK that small republic towards external , disruptive movements in an effort to solve other problems , granted - let it be noted - that it has institutions which it can build upon still further and so become a real democracy .    3.5847568054011636
in that area , there have been various policies from time to time , and what the european union should guard against is the risk that , for ultimately superficial reasons , it may help to create banana republics elsewhere .    4.150519693414584
we must be sure that , in seeking allies in the area , we must not always choose anyone who offers .    4.394285688525476
we must choose those which are moderate , which have breadth of vision and which have a perception of peace and stability in the area .    3.7434882580097604
i hope and wish , and am indeed certain , that the european union , with maturity and with the measures it has begun to adopt , will little by little construct , in the wider area , the necessary environment which it needs itself .    4.237077666606711
let us not deceive ourselves : a europe , one part of which is being held back because of UNK , UNK and conflicts , and because of nationalistic clashes , will never be a europe that has brought its own house to the level it wants .    4.348055142732295
in any event , speaking now as a greek , i want to tell some of the speakers i listened to earlier that much of what was said is UNK on other times and places .    3.6765368296855625
they have quite failed to grasp the new conditions created in the area ; the new and positive conditions which have been created , in very many cases on greece ' s initiative .    3.9773056202133303
you should know that the country which cooperates most with fyrom and has the best relations with it , in the entire area , is greece , and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area .    4.461376183211975
i say this just so that we know where we stand .    3.928859206644468
. this has been a very interesting general debate about the balkans as a whole .    4.2892042400813315
it was none the worse for that , but perhaps i will be forgiven for concentrating very largely on the report because there are some extremely important issues that i want to touch on .    4.41562031581053
i am delighted to be able to be able to set out the commission ' s position on the report .    4.1217160383652125
it is very helpful .    3.182771195862345
it is an excellent contribution by mr swoboda and his colleagues .    3.5361104125553835
we are very grateful for his leadership on this issue and for that of some of his colleagues , a number of whom are in the house this evening - mrs pack , mr lagendijk and others .    4.3153976277938195
i am very pleased that at our overall relations with fyrom are in such a good state .    3.217541220286473
perhaps mr dupuis will forgive me for using that expression - both he and his interpreter - in the spirit of UNK UNK .    3.3114223684676323
that has been helped by our excellent european union representative in the country .    3.389692639460834
he has been a great friend to parliament and a great servant of the commission .    4.055982763814014
so to is the cooperation of fyrom in the rebuilding of kosovo .    3.674106781316559
i am grateful to the authorities in macedonia for their assistance in recent weeks in helping to cope with the considerable difficulties with the power supply in kosovo .    3.230345718065524
like honourable members i recognise the stabilising role that this country has played during the balkan tragedy , in particular when it comes to integrating the albanian minority into the political and social life of the country .    3.9931433632402435
i saw the newly - elected president georgievski a few weeks ago and i was extremely impressed , as others have been , by his commitment to multi - ethnicity and UNK .    3.0874745705819877
let me set out where matters now stand on these negotiations to which - as mr lagendijk said - other countries in the region are looking with very considerable interest .    3.3714053394213686
this represents the most important step forward in the stabilisation and association process of the western balkans region initiated by the commission in may 1999 .    4.315764887293259
let me make clear the main elements of those draft directives .    2.875182700046315
they cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with fyrom .    3.1732843387573175
they cover provisions for enhanced regional cooperation including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region , though i must make it clear that there is no question of any attempt to recreate the state of yugoslavia .    3.454373732311841
they cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the european union and them within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement .    3.3696343798613255
they cover provisions on the movement of workers , freedom of establishment , supply of services , current payments and movement of capital .    3.076281947945419
they cover a commitment by fyrom to approximate its legislation to that of the european community , notably in key areas of the internal market ; and they cover provisions on cooperation with fyrom in a wide range of fields , including justice and home affairs .    3.601104316666973
we are now making in the commission the necessary preparations so that negotiations can start in march .    3.721591743810992
i am due to visit fyrom in the second week in march .    3.376115254276206
at the time of that visit i will also , as recommended by honourable members and others , be upgrading our representation in fyrom .    3.484340743200223
the target date for concluding the negotiations is december this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators .    3.143929899232015
the agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now , given the time needed for ratification in member states ' parliaments .    3.433499483907935
i should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution .    3.5666021595445834
we accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements , although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries , each of which has its own identity and its own concerns .    3.8955245204579887
i share the wide - spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not UNK everyone to the pace of the UNK in the development of relations with the union .    4.123848575771777
that has never been the intention .    3.475010772398514
the very fact that negotiations are beginning first with fyrom , before all the others , is evidence that we can and do differentiate .    3.7199775281536924
on the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross - border or regional dimension .    3.7353099377358294
we agree that there should be an UNK clause on the prospect of eu membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement .    3.2469023317563
it will reflect the european union ' s position on its relations with the countries of the western balkans as set out in the cologne european council conclusions .    3.8544902126371916
we strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent .    3.6381251747258276
as for the arrangements covering european union assistance to the western balkans , members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and UNK their management and to put everything under one regulation .    3.8049186236633243
i am aware that there is concern in fyrom and elsewhere at the end of the phare programme in these countries and , especially , at the loss of association with the phare name .    4.100059864193162
i note with considerable concern what members say on this score .    3.005538556890144
i will take another look at the issue , although i should point out that having two phare programmes up and running risks real confusion .    3.827558847923451
in general i trust that members of this house will share my pleasure that macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly .    3.336499741795841
i hope that the other countries of the region will UNK their efforts to make similar progress .    3.8869541354713117
i look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking , i hope , the success of what we are trying to do in the balkans which , for me , remains the single most important litmus - test of what europe is able to do on its own doorstep .    4.119622230210664
thank you very much , commissioner patten .    2.033338651678401
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.5929767225492002
agreement on comitology    4.38762489143055
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0021 / 2000 ) by mrs frassoni , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the agreement between the european parliament and the commission on the implementation of the new council decision of 28 june 1999 on comitology ( 1999 / 468 / ec ) .    2.5487129910045145
. ( it ) mr president , the approval of this agreement with the commission on procedures for implementing the council decision on comitology marks the end of a UNK which has kept parliament busy for two years , along with a few enthusiasts scattered among the various institutions of the union , whom many people do not hesitate to call UNK .    3.910193514392363
until 1993 , the way the commission exercised its executive powers , and in particular the mysterious and even suspect committee arrangements , was creating conflict and mistrust between the institutions , and threatening to have serious consequences on the legislative procedure .    3.4978466221434172
that is why , in accordance with declaration no 31 , annexed to the treaty of amsterdam , the union institutions have undertaken a complex task of negotiation and consultation , resulting in the new council decision , which UNK the old system quite substantially , although we are not entirely satisfied with it .    3.6870601317026352
in particular , the decision outlines a form of parliamentary control whereby parliament can sound the alarm if an implementing measure , deriving from an act adopted under the codecision procedure , UNK the implementing powers delegated to the commission .    3.249957382156913
during the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw parliament actively involved , thanks to the work of the rapporteur , UNK UNK - it was understood that the european parliament and commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision . on the one hand , certain points which the council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and , on the other , the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely .    4.429822772119184
during the UNK held on 6 october 1999 in strasbourg , the presidents of the european parliament and the commission approved the idea of concluding this agreement soon .    3.7674223946440755
we believe we have respected that commitment , and indeed this was made relatively easy by the climate of trust and mutual respect evident throughout the negotiations with the commission .    3.378372666129769
essentially , the agreement deals with two points : one is the right of the european parliament to be informed , which is the sine qua non for the genuine exercise of its right to intervene pursuant to article 8 of the decision .    3.9210951378502785
hitherto , such information had been UNK on paper and UNK , and was of no use to our services ; and indeed this was often the fault of parliament itself .    3.9258777474938484
from now on , the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called UNK , to which the european parliament will have access . this represents a real innovation , not only for us , but also - i am sure - for the commission .    5.068567204551881
the other point is that article 8 of the council decision does not specify either the method by which the european parliament is to sound the alarm , or the time limit within which it must exercise its restricted power of control .    3.7580356272027102
paragraphs 6 and 7 of the agreement confirm that , as a general rule , the european parliament will adopt its resolution , stating its reasons , at a plenary sitting and has one month to exercise its right of intervention before the commission adopts the draft implementing measure .    4.153272350780512
but we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure .    3.826900836431079
therefore , the agreement contains explicit provisions on urgent procedure , including possible action by the committee responsible .    3.779081301757998
i want to end by stressing that we cannot assess whether this is a good agreement or not , we must wait and see how it works in practice .    4.204958624605095
the european parliament needs to acquire the resources , which it currently lacks , to ensure efficient monitoring of implementing measures , and the commission must accept that some of its practices need reorganising to provide proper information to parliament and ensure that control can be effective .    4.416605963234645
finally , it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the european parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the treaties , and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an UNK that severely restricts the commission ' s executive power and may prejudice the european parliament ' s legislative powers .    4.025157536710408
mr president , comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means .    3.3083650977368912
it makes them think of secret societies and UNK , which is the way things used to be .    4.337309672702543
in fact , it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the commission .    2.5804197563045443
up until the amsterdam treaty , there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures , which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens .    3.568475403401942
on the contrary , for a long time even the european parliament was not informed .    4.045466837640158
for the european parliament , the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed , at least , of all that the european commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees .    4.881408203778351
agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between lord plumb and mr delors .    3.3838783004284902
a further step towards transparency and the involvement of the european parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 september 1994 , which granted parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases .    4.138315540944849
it also gave it the possibility of scrutiny .    3.6753470177932797
with the amsterdam treaty , the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the european parliament had long wanted - to three procedures , the administrative procedure , the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure .    3.874939810234411
now , following the amsterdam treaty , the rights of information and control granted to the european parliament in the past need to be enshrined UNK in an interinstitutional agreement .    5.42306266221981
mrs frassoni , our rapporteur , has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within parliament .    4.37846230348401
a key problem is the time factor .    4.169339872469205
when the european parliament is informed , it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks , should it so wish .    3.5326027944372154
in matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the european union , the european commission , as guardian of the treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative , must be in a position to react very rapidly , if necessary within a few hours or days .    4.471461197862017
nevertheless , the european parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react .    3.8237061827793055
our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties , which i and my group can only support in full .    3.7405875719273887
i just have one more request .    3.089969969712972
in the german version , paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather UNK and i urgently ask for clarification , which i would also like to see in the UNK version later .    4.500276818474692
in my view , instead of " UNK werden müssen " the wording should be " UNK UNK müssen " .    3.1120414366064924
the german version is not very clear here .    3.6509739083980155
i would ask for that to be checked again .    3.1672594849887306
for the rest , i warmly thank our rapporteur .    3.31658300122376
it is a difficult subject and i hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now .    4.660891074527103
mr president , i congratulate the rapporteur on her report .    2.335945582190616
when it comes to the igc , she is one of what the french call " UNK UNK et UNK " : no compromise , no deals with the other institutions ; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions .    3.6101355754912094
yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved , which are far from UNK parliament ' s original position on the issue of comitology .    5.297762986241729
let us remember what is at stake here .    2.979698834083832
parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement .    3.4255256307438997
firstly , the whole system is obscure .    3.6317264894194405
it is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees .    3.060309023077503
here is a real step forward , in the new system that has been agreed .    6.668336774908196
we are to know who is on each committee .    3.4164606692255766
we are to know when they meet .    3.125928537104378
we are to get the agendas .    3.0523213862470415
we are to get the documents that are sent to them .    3.1291813652899294
the whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex .    3.5856592192637606
our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the commission .    3.977398206099828
we adopt legislation in the european union .    3.390537630042301
we expect the commission to implement it .    3.3814780373026734
and then we have a system designed to hinder the commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the " contre - UNK " system , under which the council could block the commission by a simple majority even when the council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned .    3.844929488159971
here too there is at least some progress .    3.2976006079883184
the council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three - month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it , in other words , unless there is substantial opposition among the member states represented in the council .    3.9538283805717236
that is a more reasonable system .    3.131485435598191
that , too , is a step forward .    4.564543667481126
but on our other two criticisms , we are less satisfied .    4.129575083319844
the first criticism is of the system whereby the commission is monitored , scrutinised , controlled if you like , only by a committee appointed by member states or the council not by parliament .    4.284428178980675
the legislative authority , council and parliament , should be equal .    3.9987838423108606
we confer implementing powers on the commission , but then it is only a council or member state appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the commission and stop the implementing measure .    4.155706245396982
parliament has no equivalent power .    3.206094486050587
true , we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system .    5.416909031888198
we are to receive all the draft implementing measures forwarded to a committee at the same time as it is sent to the committee .    4.000226599033096
we will have the chance to scrutinise , to debate , to question .    3.574091440528018
but we will only have the right to formally challenge the commission if we think it has gone beyond the delegation that we have given to the commission in the legislation .    4.809390128402823
in other words , we can challenge the measure for being ultra - UNK but not on its content .    3.153810529990823
and in a democracy , parliament should be able to challenge the content .    5.059270331082207
not that we do so every week .    4.713380631516307
we are not seeking to UNK ourselves in implementing decisions , but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary .    4.199405567619005
that is lacking in this new system , or at least is only there in embryonic form .    3.4724602303409795
finally , our fourth criticism is that if an implementing measure is blocked through the comitology system it is referred back , not to both branches of the legislative authority , but to the council alone , which has the right possibly to take an alternative measure .    3.942409923171864
that is not correct .    3.0447549499009505
both branches adopt the legislation - council and parliament - that confers implementing powers on the commission .    3.3024097883340846
if such implementing measures are referred back , it should be to both branches , not to one branch alone .    4.212916151243485
overall we have a system which has made some progress .    4.678064055019646
the supplementary aspects that arise from the interinstitutional agreement with the commission are welcome , but that could not change the basic decision of the council .    4.348571992342187
even here , we have renounced voluntarily - because this did not happen automatically - the plumb - delors agreement as part of the overall compromise .    4.06821415506071
we have been willing to UNK the provisions in that .    3.7764137086774676
we shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision .    4.336729700751096
we must be very vigilant .    3.088127443967904
so it is a step forward .    3.4533106249654115
my group reluctantly accepts it as a step forward .    3.4641404521411943
we are not as UNK about compromising as mrs frassoni .    3.1932529959137694
we recognise that there are limitations and the issue will no doubt come back in a few years ' time .    3.6321168992711113
if we want a union that is democratic and transparent to the fullest degree we will have to revisit this subject .    3.3867265522615844
mr president , first i want to thank the rapporteur , mrs frassoni , for her work .    2.854099855398544
it is never easy working on comitology .    3.1766748336291784
mrs schleicher referred to a kind of committee magic , something we have long talked about .    3.5073770858024873
certainly the process has always been very complex , as a result of historical decisions , and these must eventually be rationalised .    4.056995316122622
in my opinion , the agreement reached between commission and parliament is a clear rationalisation of the process .    3.5601069718449048
from our point of view , it satisfies the fundamental interests of parliament .    3.675467398052244
mr corbett set out parliament ' s concerns .    3.683042057799144
he says some of them have been satisfied and others have not .    3.6853544931921083
i would say the ones the commission was able to satisfy have been satisfied .    3.677075568615521
mr corbett is raising issues the council decision does not cover , and unfortunately we can go no further on those .    3.3765079043831543
so how far have we come ?    3.3677358557222177
there is no doubt that we have reached a fundamental point , highlighted by mrs frassoni , given that we now have an automatic information system .    3.5066595765944153
this will facilitate two activities parliament is especially interested in .    2.8482794026523472
one is knowing how the committees operate , about their composition , agendas , descriptions , and so on , and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions .    3.6569715025724205
i think this is a good agreement .    2.988021169280393
it is a good agreement which undoubtedly improves the transparency of the process .    2.8262897631340262
from here on things are going to be easier .    4.2047588048268345
but the agreement we are reaching today should not be regarded as a backward step compared with the plumb / delors agreement .    3.307987746563092
mr corbett referred to that , but the new model is certainly much more complex , different because the situation is now different , and , in our opinion , much more coherent .    4.299972002856569
we have made a start , and we hope the work will produce some excellent results .    3.769111594417916
we think there are other positive advances too .    3.4717539678877074
to a certain extent we have gone beyond agreements which are already dated and , by UNK old procedures with the new situation , we aim to clear up everything still outstanding from the past .    3.716431945370665
from the commission ' s point of view , our conclusion is that this is a good agreement , and we want to thank the members of parliament who worked on it - especially mrs frassoni .    4.452928386044852
thank you very much , commissioner solbes mira .    1.9642360086491992
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.5929767225492002
protocol on the excessive deficit procedure    3.7090493624537784
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0013 / 2000 ) by mr knörr borràs , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on a proposal for a council regulation amending regulation ( ec ) no 3605 / 93 on the application of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure annexed to the treaty establishing the european community ( com ( 1999 ) 444 - c5 - 0174 / 1999 - 1999 / 0196 ( cns )    1.8300311085777996
mr president , i am also pleased to welcome the spanish commissioner , mr solbes mira , whom i have congratulated more than once , inside and outside this parliament , on the excellent work he did in spain on the subject of european convergence .    3.875110102158563
the proposal for an amendment to this regulation on the application of the protocol on the excessive deficit procedure , annexed to the treaty of maastricht , raises fundamental issues concerning the switch to the 1995 european system of accounts , which , as you know , replaced the previous system of accounts adopted in 1979 , and in particular the emergence of new financial product categories , consistency in the calculation of the UNK of government deficit to gross domestic product on the basis of esa 95 and , finally , recognising the importance of calculating interest expenditure and the consistency of the latter with this new methodology .    3.343756336214816
in our view , the main purpose of the proposal for a regulation is to update the definitions and the assessments of some of the economic operations involved in the calculation of deficits , as reflected in the treaty establishing the european community , the treaty of maastricht , which lays down the maximum percentages which the government deficit must not exceed as a ratio of gdp at market prices in the various member states .    3.3793122340809973
to date , the member states have calculated this gdp in accordance with the criteria laid down in esa 79 .    3.812230140706416
the most recent estimate of the deficit was submitted in september 1999 and it relates to the 1998 financial year .    3.193044321816165
therefore , if the regulation is adopted , the estimate which is due to appear in march 2000 , the first estimate of the deficit for the 1999 accounting year , will be made using the new system .    3.8856468423909942
we know the member states have done their duty - if i can use that expression - doing their calculations and preparing their national accounts in line with esa 95 , and they have already published their corresponding estimates .    3.5787535116543356
in addition to incorporating a new methodology , this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations , on account of the aforesaid methodological changes , and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates .    3.5489564383551224
these changes may of course alter the government deficits in terms of the member states ' national accounting .    3.701966605809758
i will now describe , very briefly , the five areas where the most important changes may occur .    3.787642610384461
first , the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by ' government institutional sector ' under esa 95 .    3.37446934104369
this is important , since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government .    3.2094964780817583
the non - availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the member states ' government deficits .    3.8475049771052863
secondly , the deficit - or , if applicable , the surplus - means the esa 95 government sector ' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively    3.016032737779229
thirdly , government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector , as defined in esa 95 .    3.4869939989136043
fourthly , government debt is defined in accordance with esa 95 , as are the flows or interest stemming from assets / UNK .    3.154999542715061
fifthly and finally , the UNK to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices , estimated in accordance with the 1995 european system of accounts ' definitions .    3.433622704277501
to summarise , i consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 european system of accounts , and i therefore approve it in full , as did the committee .    3.5082029337905776
we have already heard about the various aspects involved .    3.3961730742911937
what i think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable .    3.3058688565346834
we need that because the various european union bodies and all the member states within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another .    4.453123293383897
it is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons .    2.993013857634614
firstly , for the single market .    4.42211889194598
it is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends .    3.4277537863806575
secondly , for economic and monetary union .    2.9818023771693833
the regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the european system of accounts at national and regional level .    3.5634897224978865
that is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits .    2.994679195241024
this adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the member states more precisely .    3.8817524867099023
these technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries , since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit .    5.331280786187965
i also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in march 2000 are already based on the new esa , i . e . the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant .    3.478848796350074
let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit .    3.737655767262449
it is good that the procedure exists .    2.671076361958955
we need it because it UNK our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility .    3.504651790023289
the citizens ask what happens if the criteria are not met .    3.2712853131392765
thanks to these procedures and other measures we can prove that we are taking the criteria and ourselves seriously .    3.9799435691274065
another important point is that we must do all we can , not just to prevent excessive deficits , but also to further reduce public deficits .    4.306743229382007
in my country , austria , new elections had to be held in 1995 in order to meet the maastricht criteria and persuade our political partner to rethink his approach .    3.3182433351477507
i must also tell you that in the year 2000 , when there is so much talk about us , the coalition talks with the spö failed - and unfortunately so - because the socialist party brought down the negotiated austerity and consolidation programme .    3.8404396209676985
that is a prime reason why the new government had to be formed in austria ; for the austrian people ' s party , the övp , wants to continue to act as guarantor of economic stability . the övp wants to ensure that we continue to meet the maastricht criteria and reduce the public deficit , as we have agreed here .    3.7850930495730073
mr president , the beauty of statistical data is that it is not only reliable but also comparable .    3.2965879994848146
this is of great importance , especially in the light of european unification and the completion of the internal market .    3.2233585464357026
this is why this report is also so politically charged : a report , by the way , on which we would like to congratulate the rapporteur warmly .    4.475828387277455
all countries participating in the euro have committed themselves , in the medium term , to striving towards a budget which is either balanced or shows up a slight surplus .    3.7804537818453614
this , of course , does not mean that , if the economic climate is less than favourable , the budget could not UNK up or down slightly . it means that , in the long and medium term , there should be a balance or surplus .    4.420499699305586
the stronger the position of the participating countries , the stronger the euro will be .    3.6678477592989025
as a result , the three percent standard will rarely be exceeded , not even in a bad economic climate .    3.0556235266620537
this is the theory behind it , anyway .    2.9879826590816725
we have always been of the opinion that these criteria should be UNK met .    3.5502638263192487
that is of great importance in order to turn the emu into a success , now and in the future .    4.137145511211779
various member states have taken one - off measures to be able to meet the criteria .    4.39956150061608
we are of the opinion that the member states ' budget policy should be strictly supervised , to ensure that the measures continue to be taken in the spirit of the prescribed criteria at all times .    3.981263687295071
a drop in standards should not be allowed .    3.2287203366393267
we are also of the opinion that a further reduction in the burden and reducing the national debt should be prioritised .    3.0827114305296504
indeed , we still have not managed to stop passing on the burden to future generations .    3.0955326486318215
. ( es ) mr president , many thanks , first of all , to the rapporteur for his splendid work .    3.637176598311659
it was a subject which called for a large dose of technical skill and i think mr knörr has handled it with great precision and professionalism .    3.37782669899997
i would not presume to be able to summarise the content of our proposal better than he has done ; i would just like to add one small point : in addition to adaptation to esa 95 , there are two small technical changes which mr knörr knows all about , relating to interest and the valuation of debt in foreign currency .    3.729006505833489
i just mention that to complete the view of the process .    3.99877816528432
secondly , i would like to thank mr knörr for his UNK .    3.1118475791852607
he has done really good work in a very short time .    3.6204641269093014
this is an important subject for certain references which we have heard subsequently .    3.6767357396351543
what we are seeking with this legislation is not to make the statistics reliable and comparable - they already are - but to make them more reliable and more comparable .    3.7801889817875747
obviously , the fact that parliament has taken its decision so quickly will mean that the march figures can already be calculated on the basis of these new criteria .    3.662723794434717
that being so , i believe the final result will be better .    4.596178453961677
this regulation is purely instrumental .    3.3365754143986646
it does deal with the substance of the problem some of you have raised .    3.4918259885629146
but we do need to think about how we deal with the substance of the problem .    3.4413374210853642
the stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various member states , despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the member states where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit .    4.883107034669411
but we see no reason to lower our guard .    3.2074526851320666
we must press on in that direction because we know it is vital .    4.158124408129888
so , once again - and finally - i want to thank you for your help in allowing us to measure stability with greater technical certainty and better UNK .    3.2377278513021217
thank you very much , commissioner solbes mira .    1.9642360086491992
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.5929767225492002
increasing penal sanctions against counterfeiting of the euro    4.111151858686186
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0020 / 2000 ) by mrs cederschiöld , on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , on a draft framework decision of the council on increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro ( 5116 / 1999 - c5 - 0332 / 1999 - 1999 / 0821 ( cns ) .    2.11538544987871
.    2.4274255028413507
( sv ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen ( all the more welcome for being so few in number ) , one might have thought that it was an UNK subject which was to be discussed at this hour , but that is not the case .    3.5108366790350494
it is a definite and concrete issue . it is about our common currency .    3.9508411960171346
how many people here know that this currency is being counterfeited and that we have a quite unacceptable state of affairs ?    4.264158420077732
we cannot permit our common currency to become weaker through its being counterfeited .    3.0760465981443574
the ecb , ecofin , europol , olaf and the commissioner responsible for legal questions have therefore realised that common countermeasures must be taken quickly in order to close the loopholes left by the legislation .    3.8592654481688435
it is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced .    3.2006115815828347
it is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions .    3.395911551156366
this is something which parliament has said it wants to see added .    3.2139580344871614
any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency , and that country would be accountable , both UNK and economically , if its actions were to contribute to a delay .    3.978066040997525
a country which acted in that way would bring a lot of ill will upon itself .    4.034240037535924
on 1 january 2002 the euro will be in circulation .    3.3122694693522474
the whole of the union must have the same protection , a type of protection which prohibits counterfeiting , not only of currencies in circulation but also of currencies which will be in circulation .    4.614757016497117
it is important that , in time , there should be a more or less similar - looking form of protection under criminal law in all countries .    3.9286673193141546
the commission has proposed measures aimed at providing information , together with penal sanctions , preventive measures and the pooling of experience .    3.202264009504368
these measures do , in fact , entail a certain necessary harmonisation in as much as the lowest acceptable maximum penalty for currency counterfeiting is to be eight years ' imprisonment .    3.711100223390102
trading with counterfeit currencies and the possession of counterfeiting equipment will also become criminal offences .    3.2205273114193593
quite simply , we are to have a minimum level for the maximum penalty .    4.188649646757176
the UNK of the euro are well known .    3.481077463216558
modern computer equipment can be used to cause a very great deal of damage if we do not protect ourselves .    4.366605637090932
parliament has tabled a number of amendments to the present proposal , for example in regard to jurisdiction , the idea being that a person may only be prosecuted and sentenced in the one country for the same crime .    4.329876872465863
there are also proposed sanctions against companies which are involved in counterfeiting , this being a measure which we would encourage .    3.7342932666888546
the new applicant states are also encouraged to adapt to these regulations .    3.357292706832293
it has taken two years for the council and the commission to produce this proposal .    4.081611173086318
it is essential that the decision should now be taken in march .    3.308204116822311
to delay , or perhaps even risk damage to the euro , would be UNK .    4.243237602108648
it would also be a UNK of the people who will be handling the new , UNK notes .    4.087024192996028
in particular , it is believed that counterfeiters will turn their attention to countries outside the euro zone , where people are less familiar with the new currency .    3.841442567451066
the protective measures cover these countries too , and the views expressed by these countries have carried a lot of weight .    4.253197938241213
the present proposal is therefore staunchly inclusive and reciprocal in character , accepting responsibility for a variety of interests in a way which imposes obligations upon others .    3.1557534895011097
the council must now UNK in march and make the relevant decision .    3.5307582152807213
thank you for listening .    3.1605626920672742
thank you , too , those who contributed to this matter ' s being dealt with swiftly . i am thinking in particular of the group of the party of european socialists .    3.4873122248174386
mr president , first i want to compliment the rapporteur , charlotte cederschiöld , on drawing up this report , which is an excellent point of departure for increasing protection by penal sanctions against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro .    3.014399852630802
the euro will enter into circulation on 1 january 2002 and will become one of the world ' s most important reserve currencies .    3.425722264867957
due to its importance on a world scale , the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and forgery .    3.6262158286821187
this draft decision therefore lays down a set of minimum standards intended to harmonise criminal law in this field and make its application by each member state simpler and more effective .    3.5101745015367776
it also provides for the euro to be protected even prior to its circulation , which will fill a gap in legislation in some member states .    3.4724701381675827
i expressly support the rapporteur as regards the need to extend this protection to national currencies which can continue to be exchanged after they have been withdrawn from circulation .    3.8824523443203067
this means that every member state must guarantee the establishment of effective , adequate penal sanctions , which act as a deterrent against the offences covered by the draft framework decision .    3.7559117714476726
as to the proposal to establish a maximum UNK sentence of not less than eight years , i do not think that this will raise any problems as far as my country is concerned , even though the maximum sentence for counterfeiting under its criminal code is currently five years in prison , as it has already expressed willingness to make this amendment .    4.239558838304091
i also call on those few member states still UNK reservations to resolve them so that a decision can rapidly be reached on this matter , for the reasons our rapporteur set out earlier when she called for this to be done .    3.7250690575170116
mr president , this draft framework decision represents the first time a common proposal on crime has been put forward , with legislation to be applied by all fifteen member states at the same time .    3.726119908042513
we are therefore making progress towards the aim of developing and confirming the status of the european union as an area of freedom , security and justice , as expressed at tampere .    2.986011524346554
mr president , i need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points mr UNK made . all that is indeed very true and correct .    3.375657317286137
it is easy to counterfeit the euro .    2.7016752781920905
we are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history .    3.2640301738206836
it is that a currency that does not even exist yet , that is not in circulation , but exists only as bank deposit money , can nevertheless be counterfeited already . yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such , counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence .    3.779385691315186
it is a highly complex problem .    3.1969189079483815
if we do not act promptly - as mrs cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation .    3.0050394176330966
let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people .    3.61238646318058
so what is the european union doing about it ?    4.366649122303625
it is doing a number of things that are right , as mrs cederschiöld has described ; but , in the context of these things she described , parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision , not so much at the report drawn up by mrs cederschiöld , but more at the procedures that are being applied .    4.035068734639479
the manner in which the council , which is by far the most undemocratic institution in europe , consulted the european parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy .    4.9538882752800815
we received a text for consultation which the council had been working on for a very long time , incidentally with only partial success - i will come to that in a moment .    4.1149108907488126
now the european parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex , difficult and , at times , contradictory council document in the space of three months .    4.020550151672777
it is only thanks to the immense efforts of mrs cederschiöld and to parliament ' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages , that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the council , so that the decision scheduled for march can indeed be taken .    4.2433131428396695
on a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the council is demanding of us .    3.2494319002634215
so let me state quite clearly here , on behalf of my group , that we discussed at length with mrs cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this .    3.654906811854431
we concluded that it is not , but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure .    4.406235310179366
this framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress .    3.2979350204704647
only , as mrs cederschiöld pointed out , in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with . they relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish , the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all member states , including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited .    4.035534701770805
one reason they have not been dealt with is that as ever the UNK cannot change its spots , i . e . in the case of this framework decision , which specifically relates to judicial cooperation , the council once again prefers to adhere to the level of government cooperation .    3.8493832895942393
that is why , and i quote , this framework decision " is confined to supplementing the provisions of the international convention of 20 april 1929 for the suppression of counterfeiting and its protocol " , i . e . the provisions of a UNK international convention that is a good 71 years old .    3.407213774550606
that means that the legal basis we are now seeking to establish to protect the euro does not derive from community legislation , as it should , but merely takes the form of provisions supplementing an international convention dating back 71 years .    4.059055334004452
i leave it to the assembled company in this chamber to decide whether that can be the future of a european union based on judicial cooperation .    4.6832158976441205
thank you for your attention during our night sitting together .    2.677583152882548
mr president , the launch of the euro could well be a heaven - sent opportunity for counterfeiters .    3.0403800589880556
the fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references , and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article .    3.6727063884671196
so the council is naturally worried and is seeking to establish sanctions , primarily criminal , applicable in all the countries of europe , against offences of this kind .    3.708673731483235
no doubt the council could have been satisfied with a simple resolution recommending that member states adopt national legislation to that effect .    3.598595423656859
that is what i would have preferred , personally .    3.585480986537077
but , probably through lack of confidence in the UNK of certain members , the council has preferred to implement a legal instrument which is more binding at european level : a framework decision .    4.557270289877193
now that is where the difficulties begin , because criminal law comes under national sovereignty and the treaty of maastricht contains no specific provision covering this situation for the euro - so as not to UNK the voters by over - UNK the UNK .    3.7070636238945482
the draft framework decision before us today tries to cover up this UNK by referring to articles 31 and 34 ( 2 ) ( b ) of the treaty .    3.396481583597755
however , i find these UNK inadequate .    3.2268700144897378
article 31 only envisages minimum common rules for criminal acts in certain cases , specifically restricted to organised crime , terrorism and drug trafficking .    3.041503069096939
counterfeiting is not on the list .    3.8741524804541196
article 34 , a product of the treaty of amsterdam , only lays down the new form of a framework decision , and clearly this only applies to the existing powers of the european union .    3.8229396297435896
so we come back to the previous problem .    3.695051556466071
in other words , the council has not succeeded in giving this text a credible legal basis .    2.9967805632789917
in a way , this is deferred punishment for its lack of honesty , at the time , in presenting the maastricht treaty to the voters .    4.303663789879749
i would also like to make a more general point .    3.2366086713205875
not so long ago we were dealing with one or more reports on questions of principle relating to the euro in virtually every part - session .    3.6825510770293084
but there has been nothing for a year .    4.05741758920061
just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting .    3.197190566215598
the commission ' s communication on its strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 , which we have debated this week , contained absolutely nothing on this vast subject , except the reminder , in a single line , that the euro coins and notes are due to come into circulation on 1 january 2002 .    3.39588581275341
however , there are many underlying problems yet to be resolved .    3.2683775856250037
let us mention , for example , the disturbing lack of public interest , the definition of monetary policy objectives UNK reduced to the mere fight against inflation , the strange UNK of monetary federalism to a lack budgetary or fiscal federalism , the status of the present applicant countries , when they become members , vis - à - vis the euro zone , the confused reaction of the international markets to this currency with no UNK popular foundation , and so on . do i also need to mention that investors who sold dollars to buy euros have lost 20 % since 1 january 1999 , 40 % if they bought bonds , and no less than 55 % if they sold yen to buy euros ?    3.3267663936720435
mr president , for those unfortunate investors even real euros are false money .    2.7351465258328447
these are gigantic problems but they seem to be UNK here .    3.8212867221415565
i should like to take over the UNK from the previous speaker .    3.8911386980208746
there are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions , because the point of departure is , of course , that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern .    4.090435838205512
criminal law is part of each individual nation ' s own cultural tradition , and it is very difficult to arrive at common definitions of what is to be understood by these basic legal concepts .    4.473908184905525
i appreciate mrs cederschiöld ' s work , and my point of departure will be her search - in connection with the tampere summit - for common definitions and common regulations regarding what is punishable and what common sanctions can be applied .    3.6083628924673863
she would like to devise these sanctions jointly so as to arrive at a coherent criminal justice system for offences which have particular relevance for the eu .    3.844409232618427
but the problem is that there is no legal basis for this , and with good reason , because the regulation of criminal law belongs to the sphere of national jurisdiction .    4.326707703691838
in that context , i want to ask the following question of the commission ' s and the council ' s representatives : is the legal basis which has been UNK adequate ?    5.307219750170857
in my view , it is clearly in conflict with , and far exceeds the scope of , article 34 , paragraph 2 , point b where a legal basis is established for so - called framework decisions which are binding upon the member states in regard to the desired objectives , but in which it is left to the national authorities to determine the form and methods of implementation .    4.377766894635791
what of course characterises the present draft framework decision is the fact that the member states ' obligations are laid down in detail . there is no freedom of choice regarding methods and implementation .    4.040470964760107
in my view , this exceeds the parameters of the legal basis .    2.8291993032173575
mr president , commissioner , let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that , in her report , she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes , which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now , to supplement and improve the text .    3.670607409802844
it is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to UNK this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made .    4.155496578174492
we have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it .    2.8024699211470288
so , in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting , to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions , the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do .    4.5687947001315194
we are also concerned with the question of cooperation .    3.8575586109168722
we need to define the precise responsibilities of the ecb , the national central banks , the commission and europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro .    3.6911936396042346
i also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or eu body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work .    3.0693874985432767
in the same context , we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock , together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities .    3.5009949469007613
aside from the report , which we welcome , many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved .    4.3002877656565905
i hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification .    3.0537041604970154
mr president , mrs cederschiöld , ladies and gentlemen , how safe is the euro ?    3.238643855543733
that is , after all , a question the people often ask .    3.4349374372382133
and that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 january 2002 , the date when they will have euros in their pockets .    3.3959787943956825
for the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but , in fact , also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting .    4.277005277248957
that too is a concern of the people , for , as has rightly been said , this will be a new currency for them , new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used .    4.859862335504214
of course all the citizens of the eu member states will also be faced with the UNK of a currency that is valid over such a wider area , and even beyond europe , as a reserve currency .    5.077834429923476
they will need time to get used to that too .    3.2863959486260685
so it is clearly necessary to ask what the eu is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting .    3.5565883245778123
and that is what we are discussing at this late hour .    3.288809386379785
this really is a subject that is close to the citizen , so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour .    4.104899556471092
but that cannot be helped .    3.3403344146679603
of course , the european central bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time .    3.395842502740931
after all , it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting .    3.962324999966047
as has also been pointed out , in summer 1998 the commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken , such as information , further training - an important area , cooperation between the euro - states and of course even beyond them , and measures under criminal law .    4.066529269652678
that is what this framework decision is about .    3.270742367940243
mrs cederschiöld , let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the commission and , above all , let me also thank parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time .    4.356782558738847
i certainly appreciate that .    2.992823610210883
the framework decision aims to ensure that the member states apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences .    3.9009115593514276
of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and , as was emphasised , what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced .    3.859948502354004
naturally , the commission is also glad that the european parliament ' s prompt decision - and i hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now , so that we can begin to transpose it .    4.899683674895499
for the commission has been asked to report , as it will in the first half of next year , on the progress in transposing it in the member states , on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action .    5.3872386143823325
it has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law .    3.9638155560539325
in that respect we must recognise this innovation , this step , even if , as mr schulz just pointed out , simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step .    3.77311366243405
in reply to the question whether the commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the treaty , the commission believes that the right basis is being applied here .    4.638987272687622
the framework decision will , however , have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future .    3.897903223136759
the commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with europol .    3.049587297184153
that proposal will establish a duty to cooperate , and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the european central bank for identification and classification , so that effective measures can then be taken .    4.11150360909661
on the question of coordinating the various measures , since early 1998 , the commission , followed now by olaf , has been working with experts on the subject from the member states , the european central bank and europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance .    4.235374892682056
as mr karas just pointed out , a few weeks ago the commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro , to which it proposed allocating as much as eur 32 million .    3.810382979384322
that is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use , a large amount ; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting .    3.295867422377003
i believe that this debate shortly before midnight will also UNK a salutary lesson to all those counterfeiters who believe their hour has come , because they think the eu is no longer awake at this late hour !    3.7819097481599613
thank you very much , commissioner schreyer .    2.202863926915938
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 12 . 00 p . m .    1.5929767225492002
( the sitting was closed at 11 . 50 p . m . )    1.8399185121860644
resumption of the sitting    3.8890489486024604
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .    1.9245484651696183
are there any comments ?    2.070454319710833
( the minutes were approved )    1.9577163372853157
mr president , i should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various members of parliament from all groups .    3.373660839481849
the purpose of the meeting , which was attended by several vice - presidents and quaestors , together with the UNK who designed this building , was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions .    3.7077514206609496
we discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you , mr president , in fact conceals a huge window which , if the curtain were drawn back , would afford a wonderful view over the river .    3.8422380045179425
we were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the UNK during debates .    3.784686427367107
but what is to prevent us , before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting , opening the UNK and UNK the apparently magnificent view behind you ?    3.854302237520271
i am more than happy for our house to be UNK by the UNK of our debates but a little real UNK on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss .    3.433969299742873
i think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the UNK .    3.222482482562043
thank you very much mr onesta , i am grateful for any suggestions that will make our chamber more conducive to human comfort .    3.240524351134673
i would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being .    3.457155003785394
in the meantime , i will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter , technically speaking .    3.792998232724425
if so , then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the president sits with his back to the light !    3.5372077496820493
ucits    5.28170705968177
.    2.4274255028413507
as a new member of the european parliament , it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter .    4.657342642413206
i should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises ; the president and the bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue ; the commission , and especially the commissioner , for being such worthwhile contacts ; the council ; and also the division responsible for UNK the committee , for its UNK work .    4.111003246728099
there was a good deal of agreement within the committee , apart from on a matter which , too , i hope it will be possible to solve .    4.7167575500394365
the issue of ucits may appear difficult , technical and a political minefield .    3.4534489189319033
i believe that some people do not even know what ucits stands for .    3.3242691264799777
it is a question of weighing demands for liberalisation in the interests of a better market and higher yield against investors ' need for protection and security .    3.002438583893269
in the course of the 1980s , most markets in europe UNK drastic deregulation . as a result , the national money and UNK markets in particular developed very quickly over a period of a few years .    3.368467769269942
collective investment undertakings became an alternative to saving with a bank .    3.1634643100655975
in my own country , more than 60 per cent of swedes save with a variety of funds .    3.1951508738763175
the security afforded by this type of saving is attributable to the broad range of investment vehicles in which the funds are placed .    3.8110347536768354
the current directive on ucits has become UNK and outdated .    2.9486260516604914
new types of funds have been introduced in the various member states which are not permitted to market their units in other member states .    4.053687406963736
obviously , this UNK competition and innovation and restricts the public ' s range of savings options .    3.224041801534588
the commission ' s proposal with which we are dealing today is in two parts .    3.7397296288790307
the first concerns the product , that is to say the funds .    3.2416979364139533
the other concerns the collective investment undertakings .    3.23503581153271
the main purpose of the first proposal is to extend the investment opportunities of collective investment undertakings by allowing them to invest in units in other collective investment undertakings , for example units in funds , standardised options and futures contracts and deposits in credit institutions and in certain types of money market instruments .    3.5696502072863705
special risk - spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments , involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria .    3.0748765152042568
in addition , the commission ' s proposal puts forward special risk - spreading rules for funds whose aim is to replicate a particular stock index , a so - called index fund .    3.059527246433106
the committee wishes to make the requirements in relation to the commission ' s proposal more stringent .    4.021800775523267
to guarantee transparency and prudence , investments in non - harmonised funds should only be allowed on condition that qualitative criteria , for example a transparency requirement and investor protection , are introduced .    2.990838273002933
in addition , quantitative criteria ( risk exposure ) should be introduced .    2.720052617534126
moving on now , then , to the point where there is ( or , i hope , was ) a lack of agreement , namely otc derivatives .    4.751179833342216
the commission ' s proposal makes a distinction between derivatives dealt in on regulated markets and derivative instruments not dealt in on regulated markets ( so - called otc derivatives ) .    2.6130141323268345
the commission ' s proposal takes it as read that otc derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that ucits deal in , but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange - rate risks .    3.739145946116248
in recent years , the derivatives market has grown very rapidly in almost all the member states .    2.8926084204521145
it is therefore important that regulation of derivatives is flexible so that the market is not tied down ahead of future developments .    2.9731582850676515
the definitions ' standardised futures contracts ' and ' standardised options ' should therefore be combined to form a new definition , ' financial derivative instruments ' , which also covers otc derivatives .    3.397987353103299
investment in otc derivatives , however , should only be allowed on condition that both quantitative and qualitative criteria are introduced .    3.259647478374347
they must be introduced to guarantee the protection of investors .    3.5547067366506675
the commission ' s second proposal focuses on the bodies which manage ucits , that is to say management companies .    3.308734959146683
the rules for management companies , for example the conditions for starting up and conducting business , are brought into line with the existing rules and regulations .    3.8375575149508583
a crucial point is that rules are proposed for so - called simplified prospectuses .    3.904973495914424
relevant information must be given to UNK unit - holders in a fund in a language which is readily understandable to investors in the host country .    3.2547065752115847
a question which has also been discussed in the committee is that of the capital contribution to be required from management companies .    4.9078157249945695
there are different views on this .    3.150888530812497
one of the most important things , for me , personally , is that the common regulations should not cause smaller companies to go under .    3.793964022827577
the current situation is not good .    3.5726927077962958
both savers and the industry need modernised regulations for the whole of europe .    3.3115738936090833
i believe that today ' s proposal strikes a good balance between liberalisation of the market and the desire for effective protection for investors .    4.130070022106684
i just want to conclude by saying that a number of members of parliament think that the present proposal goes too far , while others think that i am not sufficiently liberal .    4.574282450590463
to them i just want to say , as the english expression goes , ' you can ' t have it all . '    4.072144763936843
.    2.4274255028413507
mr president , at the outset i wish to place on the official record of the house my thanks for the tremendous work undertaken by mr schmidt , our rapporteur .    3.7901017123184446
i was in fact the surrogate father of these reports during the previous parliament .    3.165454694079722
we failed over the last six years to get any compromise or agreement with regard to this matter .    3.470014092264233
in a short space of time mr schmidt has managed to bring it forward to this final stage within parliament . i thank him for that .    3.1457070955595814
as the draftsperson for the opinion of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , i also wish to place on record my thanks to the secretariat of both the legal affairs committee and the economic affairs committee for their cooperation on this matter .    3.3147954872372445
i am speaking today wearing a number of hats : firstly , as the surrogate father of this report ; secondly , as the draftsperson of the opinion ; and most importantly , as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the european union from a harmonised system of ucits investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in europe but invested outside the european union and not put to the benefit of the union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship , employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights .    4.498112496094724
there is little disagreement amongst members with regard to the first proposal .    3.054853406306161
it puts into place a certain number of controls and mechanisms to ensure that we can have this kind of harmonised regulatory authorities .    3.9381936590892264
however , it is in relation to the second proposal that there is most concern .    4.634011002960391
i have a number of ideas which should be put across .    4.477074651848326
firstly , the idea of an eu passport for management companies is to be welcomed ; and the home - state approval rule is also to be welcomed .    3.617610070796909
however , instead of imposing a new regime , we could have used the investment services directive as the UNK for this regime .    3.9052290078862364
it seems unusual that we failed to grasp that opportunity .    3.179828559374025
we will have to revisit this issue again in the near future .    3.007619004022614
i call on members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put europe on a sound footing for the short term , if not for the long term .    3.8356940782446003
mr president , i must firstly thank the rapporteur , mr schmidt , my colleague , mr goebbels , and mrs villiers and mrs lulling from my group . despite their differing opinions on some points , they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner .    3.5330610346233247
as indicated by the rapporteur , we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this parliament .    4.512672172795412
collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens , without any specialist knowledge , have invested their life savings .    3.1582505871187814
i say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution .    3.07923795264046
however , the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political , social and personal problem with UNK consequences .    3.4632252582676792
there is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings .    3.381465330153032
i believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest . specifically , at the moment , this means the protection of investors .    4.090638323605664
this basic principle of liberalisation , increased competition and greater investment opportunities , together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve , has determined and inspired my group ' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen .    3.9072577652484206
firstly , there is the problem of investment in non - harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive .    3.328217663523625
it is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion , the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments , those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high - risk funds .    3.0073403656589446
it would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments .    3.064359798208911
secondly , the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions , both within my group and between the groups .    4.13244752251856
we have achieved a compromise solution .    2.9074035685640798
everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high - risk products .    3.3969709823972285
it is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market , namely the famous otc derivatives .    2.867083091170008
we have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this , or so we believe , which i welcome .    3.844182282614012
as this issue will be returning to this house at some stage , i must highlight the working method used between the commission and this parliament .    3.976009601427075
the texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this house . this was because they were substantially amended during the finnish presidency .    3.8962212376882497
we are therefore faced with two options . we can either return the proposals to the commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process .    3.619642666029985
this second option has won the day and i am pleased about this . however , in the future i hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive .    4.81737357849811
mr president , the socialist group supports the commission ' s efforts to implement the action plan for financial services .    3.4837138464085817
obviously , in the wake of the introduction of the euro , we need to create an integrated european financial market which is similar to the american and japanese markets .    3.7718128713956407
the debates on ucits gave rise to speeches on behalf of all sorts of lobbies and heated debate in the relevant committee .    3.713258887037631
i should like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr olle schmidt , and also mr garcía - margallo y marfil , for their constructive approach .    2.5824496117783404
but the world of international finance is a dangerous one .    3.837243366663689
the capital markets are still at the mercy of their excesses .    3.265354538727873
there is at present a UNK of cash looking for a home .    4.228210392083058
in 1999 , the increase in the means of payment in the world resulted in over - stimulated stock exchanges and an explosion in the volume of transactions , pushing up the prices of long - term financial and real assets .    3.5397396619668675
and as international financial activity speeds up , the risks increase .    3.270531647288158
you do not need a nobel prize in economics to realise that the current working hypothesis of the financial markets , which anticipate annual growth in profits of the order of 15 to 25 % is quite simply unrealistic in the medium term .    3.3173213229451517
i UNK believe that the main risk to the world economy in the foreseeable future is not inflation , but deflation generated as the speculative bubbles , created by what UNK UNK calls UNK UNK markets , burst .    3.7792760260548013
the legislature has a duty to contain the risk inherent in the continuing deregulation of the european financial markets .    4.147432416827216
by definition , investment funds use other people ' s money .    3.961024961571988
the legislator should protect the general interest and introduce safeguard clauses .    3.32077373630945
there is no freedom without rules .    2.8323722000854983
these feeder funds exist in the united states , which is an area with a single supervisory authority and a single legal system .    4.119272244481842
the european market is still fragmented and such structures would doubtless cause problems .    3.083523897975191
the socialists , like the commission , question the UNK of allowing investment funds to invest in so - called over - the - counter derivatives , i . e . products negotiated between professionals by private contract .    4.4673411751797385
as these transactions are generally not subject to UNK control , the risks are all the more obvious .    3.557940260176204
the socialist group has tabled amendments proposing both quantitative and qualitative safeguard clauses in order to contain the risks to investors .    3.458852063263444
by adopting these amendments , parliament will allow recourse to otc derivatives but will also limit the risk to private investors .    3.2061786772612986
mr president , there is much talk at present of the principle of good governance .    3.637563707743124
this principle should not only guide the public sector , it should also guide the private sector , especially financial undertakings .    4.175981588240279
mr president , our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UNK is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers , which is why i want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today .    3.8086305574167754
i firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure , safer , higher returns .    3.393468480664996
despite their image of danger , derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance .    3.013303791310521
a contract that , for example , pays a substantial sum if , say , the nasdaq or the cac 40 share index falls , causes an extra payment by the investor if the nasdaq or the cac 40 share index rises .    2.6827277393921367
is this speculative ?    3.263431372518807
not at all .    3.574977150839017
then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse , as it did in 1987 .    4.214544799864477
you have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash , but that would be to waste your research into the winners .    3.4801139335563542
it would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall .    2.7970246720992193
the solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the nasdaq or cac 40 falls .    3.0364945358291155
but even with a tailor - made derivative or otc derivative which would be cheaper , perhaps UNK you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index , you would still have the portfolio and the shares , but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse .    3.18543837600238
in exchange , you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets .    3.838149203844581
in this case , which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers , you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk .    3.54182364325516
that is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund .    2.931144637095889
history demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light - handed approach to regulation .    3.1311242182483876
heavy - UNK - a UNK of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers .    3.6685985568556254
these are of course the returns after UNK all losses .    3.414009484848162
do not UNK a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off .    3.965369590104201
this is what we should be concerned about here today .    3.2564184836341803
mr president , the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in europe , including the most sophisticated forms of investment .    3.567676996855818
we do not , in principle , oppose this industry .    3.5479460372622817
however , unlike mr UNK huhne , we feel that a continent which has proved incapable of controlling its oil industry properly should not overly deregulate an industry which may , in time , provoke the same type of crisis .    3.0621134635578358
we shall therefore vote cautiously on all amendments limiting recourse to excessively derivative instruments and we shall vote in favour of all amendments which limit the excessive concentration of assets within a single financial group .    3.0979846399786353
but we make no UNK about the fact that we shall vote against the text as a whole .    3.8541885438136907
we shall also vote in the future against any proposals to deregulate the financial markets and we call on all the other political groups to do likewise until such time as taxation on investment income is finally harmonised .    3.5788050488339374
for years certain countries , including great britain , have been blocking harmonisation and turning their financial centres into tax havens .    3.2692519377979625
they even reject the strict minimum , i . e . the monti package proposed by the commission in brussels .    3.3859576353348615
this attitude is turning europe into a machine which UNK investment income from tax and shifts the whole tax burden to commercial income , with all the social and even moral consequences which that implies .    3.226219126059293
we must put an end to this .    2.5834141386871985
by blocking the demands of the financial industry , the european parliament has the means to ensure that countries which have been turned into tax havens end up with their back against the wall .    4.751840503867329
mr president , the UNK directive introduced a sort of european visa for certain types of ucits which could be marketed throughout the union .    3.3547542657108265
since then , the capital market and transferable securities have not just continued to evolve ; thanks to unbridled financial globalisation , they have UNK UNK and without restraint .    3.299970176553025
this brings us to the two proposals for directives .    3.441457862855601
the second proposal , on which the report is excellent , does not require any particular comment .    3.675173753588149
it aims to strengthen consumer protection and security .    3.541157262898499
it is a step in the right direction , even if one wonders why in heaven , with what right and with what respect for our citizens , we are further UNK the monopoly of the english language in all documents distributed throughout europe .    3.4511732748381356
that is the thrust of an amendment which we have tabled ; it favours all the languages of the community and our agreement to the second directive will depend on it .    3.9592115587682097
the same cannot be said of the first proposal .    2.896704328602619
we might have been able to agree to the original text insofar as it was informed by a legitimate concern to update current legislation .    3.758088094596686
however , we are unable to agree to the text of the report , although i welcome the work carried out by mr schmidt , for several reasons .    4.141027991909551
secondly , like him , i think that we should not promote excessive concentration in funds which , in the final analysis , will prove to be a trojan horse for american pension funds .    3.824203673750941
there is , of course , no UNK in favour of european ucits .    3.544998215331193
we shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the member states to increase to 35 % .    3.3169719144242533
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
mr president , this is a vital issue for europe .    3.0743957487591316
a europe that faces an UNK pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of europe can obtain on their savings .    3.1079360183730738
i welcome many of the developments which mr schmidt ' s report brings us .    3.974457400384656
ucits are a success story within the european union .    3.3342285353570245
they are a safe product , traded cross - border .    3.261070782917247
but it is time for the legislation to be updated .    3.873500417247378
mr schmidt has done an excellent job here .    3.206265639799073
it is no secret that i would have much preferred mr schmidt ' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through parliament .    4.140477758078228
but i appeal to this house to take a balanced and common - sense approach on this issue .    3.822388995975609
the radical step taken by this report is to allow ucits to use over - the - counter derivatives .    3.303380108143487
i appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by ucits .    3.9437779278649825
we are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation . we are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary europeans .    3.630614363881832
mr schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of parliament for over - the - counter derivatives .    3.378764935485324
we must not be afraid to go forward , to react to changes in the market .    3.382888947867466
yes , we need to continue to ensure that ucits provide a balanced and protected product for consumers .    4.344659667853028
the report gives very adequate protection for consumers .    3.0785531833463597
but a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over - the - counter derivatives .    3.173842956727456
i feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts , which can only help individual people around europe obtain a high return on their savings .    3.3575229732066822
i salute mr schmidt .    3.3299079096729587
thank you very much mr UNK .    2.5568962067204457
ladies and gentlemen , i have an update for you on the curtain and window situation .    3.158610175733989
if we open this curtain , then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away .    3.595443099816929
we will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting . however , i will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies .    3.9518601081530846
mr president , the ucits directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 october 1989 , mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors .    3.139951065519515
the directive and the reputation which ucits enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the european union fivefold .    3.393350063445262
there has been a strong increase in cross - border marketing of investments within the european union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world .    3.668187925931088
however , the directive is ten years old and , now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available , it is somewhat outdated .    4.1531520069331025
the commission proposals being debated here will give it the face - lift it needs .    3.15764503512696
i share some of the concerns expressed here , especially by mr garcía - margallo y marfil , but this face - lift would be even more successful if the funds which simply reproduce a stock exchange index , and which are therefore managed either UNK or not at all , and the funds which use an index as a benchmark for an actively - managed fund were treated in the same way , if only to allow medium - sized undertakings listed on the stock exchange but not included in the stock exchange index better access to the capital market .    3.6265824760707024
in addition , investors often have better protection with an actively - managed fund .    2.5630703677416777
my amendment no 47 is therefore a warning for UNK .    3.6614902377453635
as far as the proposal for a new provision limiting investments in the same group to 15 % is concerned , i would like to stress that , apart from the fact that this limit is too low , the text does not define the concept of a group . this concept does not exist under european law because it is impossible to implement and equally impossible to control in practice .    3.7371264177897787
i shall therefore vote against this proposed amendment .    3.2726720488380128
to conclude , mr president , allow me to remind the house that the directive needs a UNK which will make ucits even more attractive , but it does not need to be UNK into a european UNK which will UNK the life out of it .    4.379929500069224
- ( de ) mr president , the introduction of the euro and the further liberalisation of capital markets has already produced a larger and deeper european financial area , which is helping to open up markets and create price transparency , but also to increase competition .    3.6087642941983327
at the same time , it is important to appreciate the economic importance of financial business dealings , particularly those we are concerned with today .    3.3288317758168886
at the end of 1999 there were almost 15 000 investment funds registered as ucits with a total value of in excess of eur 2 billion , thereby accounting for roughly 75 % of all funds assets .    3.0859148574453124
hence the commission rightly cited the economic importance thereof in its proposals for draft directives , and i must say that i actually have every confidence in the commission ' s proposal .    3.6527668751823117
we are all aware how difficult it is to improve a legal framework for investment funds , and how difficult it is to construct the european passport for management companies around particular standards which are to apply even - UNK across the board .    3.210778236386461
this therefore represents a step forward in respect of the legal and supervisory stipulations for financial markets and financial products .    3.8180410072246476
it is also my primary concern to optimise consumer protection in this way and i think it is very important for this to be reflected in the commission ' s proposal and that of the european parliament , as well as in the compromise motions .    4.245217270177722
however , i do not believe that we can assess the risk associated with the otc derivatives , and i also think that as a european parliament it is our duty to inform and UNK again and again on consumers - who expect investment funds to be comparable with a traditional savings agreement when it comes to long - term security , and indeed that is why they were known as investment savings - that these products do not bear comparison and that is why we need a minimum level of protection .    3.999471318334325
why do we not take our UNK from the minimum level of protection afforded by the trade in transferable securities directive , article 11 for example , which relates to good practice ?    3.842119931162224
i therefore believe that this is another step forward we can take and i think it would also be a positive move if consumers and investors could be made aware of a fund ' s name so as to be able to learn something about its risk profile .    3.9410890774322542
mr president , commissioner , the proposal for a directive now under discussion brings with it several welcome reforms to the current legal provisions .    2.8734963468924724
the preparatory work has largely consisted of a viable balance between increasing the efficacy and growth of the european investment markets and preserving a sufficient level of protection for consumers who buy fund units .    3.4261752385169495
the greater the trust consumers have in investment market operations , the more consumers will be prepared to invest on the open market .    3.5967044701825075
and the more consumers invest , the UNK the prospects will be in the european business money markets .    4.855724216264586
it is quite clear that when businesses can more easily have access to their own capital - based finances their financial structure will be more firmly based , and , thus , opportunities for growth and investment will also improve .    3.5978260263786526
although in the committee on economic and monetary affairs we were very much in agreement with the aims of the legislative amendment , the debate we had was not the easiest one .    3.763288225606312
for me personally at least , difficulties were caused by the directive ' s technical division into two different proposals , which certainly did not make it easier to UNK oneself with this very difficult technical subject .    3.615974175280291
however , i would like to express my position with regard to a few detailed proposals .    3.398096144017605
firstly , i am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments .    3.9983779737736205
as regards derivatives , i consider the position adopted by the committee justified - unlike mrs randzio - plath , for example .    3.5555389998707487
the directive should not treat over - the - counter derivatives differently from standard derivatives because they are used in many member states and were also used before .    3.585880421004429
with regard to article UNK of the other proposal for a directive , the so - called article on delegation , i think the commission ' s original proposal on rules concerning authorisation was better than the one now approved in the committee , so i would support some of mrs villiers ' amendments to this point .    4.423304846223265
mr president , i see two problems with this morning ' s debate .    2.7504079381200763
firstly , when i came to this parliament many years ago i was told that if you had a difficult job you gave it to a liberal .    3.7621000031904503
now i have been told that if you have a difficult debate you know you are in trouble if half the luxembourg members are in the chamber at one time - and they are .    4.102982608155606
firstly , i welcome proposal no 1 .    3.722084978426494
it UNK things and brings things up to date .    3.152866898499951
i think many of the british members will be voting against a large number of the amendments in the report .    4.2076071427786506
we support the schmidt report on proposal no 1 , but we regret the fact that the directive sets a lot of quantity limits that restrict the ability to spread risks .    3.801092723708133
we believe that a more liberal market is the best way forward .    3.330584946691343
secondly , we consider proposal no 2 to be very confused .    3.8222070645355615
it is difficult to understand , and we think the commission would be well advised to look at it again .    4.190995391619323
if further regulation is needed , we feel that it could be better achieved by other means than those proposed in the directive .    3.6804968020251536
in particular , we disagree with the proposal on capital requirements because if they are put too high they could actually drive some businesses out of the industry altogether .    3.518866139739032
we ask the commission to look again at these proposals .    3.4448567804772554
finally , we would urge members to vote in particular against amendment no 41 on capital requirements , because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry .    4.04817068180803
mr president , money does not smell , as the UNK would say .    3.7670200268859713
the important thing is for money to generate more money .    3.041946537663583
in this we are combining the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want to live life in UNK .    4.172083805860269
for example , my brother - in - law , who lives in rome , started drawing his pension a year ago and every day since - from seven in the morning when he UNK until midnight - he has checked the tv screen to see how the pensions funds and the securities in which he has invested are performing .    3.160103713257754
pensioners will , in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal .    4.230382058512095
indeed , whilst the young are UNK , the elderly have accumulated money and , since they are keen to turn it to good advantage , harbour great hopes for this directive .    3.77580328520585
if national governments had in their hearts - as the european union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life , the pensions time bomb would already have been UNK .    3.749274721320552
you too , in your role , commissioner bolkestein , have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners , a future that i hope will improve once we have finalised this directive , by which i mean very soon , as has been proposed by mrs villiers and mrs kauppi .    4.5373297803242805
. ( nl ) mr president , could i first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur , mr olle schmidt , and the members of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , which has principal authority , as well as the rapporteur , mr UNK crowley and the members of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , whom i would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the UNK and extension of the proposals .    4.00030928699498
since the approval of directive 85 / 611 , the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules .    3.6570661444727333
the aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors , which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro .    3.940448035733543
since the average european family puts its savings in investment funds , the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and i would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk - spreading are concerned .    3.5438478437479266
the two proposals form a coherent whole .    3.3756435936911204
the first proposal UNK the number of instruments in which an ' undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities ' ( ucits ) can invest .    3.257834482515187
as already remarked in this session , ucits are key players within the modern capital markets .    2.8843267793443363
their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets , in which the principle of risk - spreading is taken into consideration , protected by appropriate supervision .    3.995904829153518
since diverse types of investment are permitted , private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques .    3.27403486110061
by allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross - border basis , these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the treaty of rome , which they have been denied for all these years .    4.208837341451626
the commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the committee on economic and monetary affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas .    3.5420594602809494
the commission will adopt amendments nos - and i am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 13 , 19 and 21 for the first proposal , and 23 , 28 and 32 for the second proposal , since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements .    3.74182969903243
i also value the ideas put forward in amendments nos 1 , 10 , 11 , 14 , 18 and 20 , although the wording needs to be adapted .    3.483682702435981
i also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in amendments nos 17 , 36 and 45 .    2.5673197612241236
i can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of amendment no 47 .    3.644275698409176
all the amendments i have listed so far pertain to the first proposal .    3.186452083441137
as far as the second proposal is concerned , the ideas of amendments nos 24 , 25 , 29 , 30 , 41 and some parts of 27 , which contain sensible suggestions , can be adopted , again formulated appropriately .    3.031937098042988
the commission has suggested adopting the content of these , with certain changes in the wording .    3.8313657569457655
moreover , i have taken note of the request made by the committee on economic and monetary affairs to UNK the entire text , once it has been approved - amendment no 7 of the first proposal and amendment no 22 of the second proposal .    4.09334971553004
the commission is in favour of UNK and will , in the foreseeable future , once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative , concentrate its efforts on drafting a UNK version .    4.010700066240691
however , i cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands .    2.929877671719416
the commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the committee on economic and monetary affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal .    3.1948339970599644
this is why the commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal :    4.270730167714689
amendment no 8 because the proposed , general reference to assets ' covered by this directive ' , instead of the more precise reference to assets ' mentioned in article 19 of this directive ' , hinders implementation .    3.354749456965962
this amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the member states , which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive .    3.492179237033866
amendment no 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms .    2.8122837020350455
neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions .    2.789931534461886
we cannot , therefore , adopt the proposed amendment for this reason .    3.681864584691845
amendment no 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive .    3.622840122896715
i therefore cannot see any reason why article 22 , paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason .    3.090496679909547
amendment no 44 cannot be accepted because , if it is prescribed that non - harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been ' imposed by the directive ' concerning lending , borrowing , selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian , this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds , for example swiss funds , would be eligible for investment .    3.9036306362382165
this goes against the commission ' s intention to widen the scope of investments , and the wording thereof could contravene UNK agreements .    4.040769260528076
amendment no 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of article UNK are concerned , because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of article 22 , especially when the ucits are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses , as discussed in the council .    3.965678504088223
the key issue regarding the first proposal , however , is parliament ' s amendment which allows the use of over - the - counter instruments for general investment purposes .    3.6310693853837916
the commission points out that , according to the national legislation of some member states , the use of otc derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised .    4.051957772074953
however , the commission will be suspending its position , given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments .    3.508653797011634
i believe that otc instruments could lead to problems , because they are not UNK , the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks .    3.839137064651664
it seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non - harmonised funds or deposits and , at the same time , freely to allow investments in clearly more risky otc instruments .    3.1366042572345787
by rejecting the rapporteur ' s amendment no 39 , the committee on economic and monetary affairs has aligned itself with the council .    3.3751732334874283
the upshot of this amendment by parliament would be that funds are allowed , in theory , to invest in otc instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market .    3.3398187100229775
in practice , access to other eu markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in otc instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against otc investments . this would contravene the fact that eu legislation applies to all funds which invest in otc instruments .    3.0452711994414816
given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in otc instruments , the commission cannot accept amendments nos 12 , 15 , 37 , 38 , 39 , 43 , 46 and 48 and parts of amendments nos 17 , 36 and 45 which pertain to otc instruments .    3.0434276236584674
as far as the second proposal is concerned , i already mentioned that the commission will take into consideration many amendments .    3.3216170689818036
despite this , there are some amendments which the commission cannot adopt : amendment no 26 , which does not seem to observe the order in which licences are granted and activities start ; parts of amendment no 27 , especially the part where the prevention of conflicts of interests is deleted , the delegation of tasks is restricted to components of management decisions and the general decision - taking of member states concerning delegation is repealed ; amendment no 31 because the commission is of the opinion that the application of article 44 of the directive in unchanged form has proved adequate for the trading in rights of participation in ucits .    3.559235556405506
the application of the provisions of the directive concerning the performance of services in the field of investments in securities , better known as isd , is therefore unnecessary and could lead to difficulties or confusion .    3.7208988214773293
amendment no 33 is ambiguous regarding ' the language ' of the guest member state , especially when there are various official languages , and it is questionable what will be gained from translations in two other languages .    3.792603370278248
amendment no 34 is unacceptable because a simple deletion of the reference to pension funds can create ambiguity as to whether or not a management company can carry out these activities .    3.4425006993997287
i think that pension funds could also benefit from this possibility , provided that management companies are not lumped together with pension funds , but may only carry out part of the management per delegation .    3.5431013777177673
amendment no 35 cannot be accepted because legally , it cannot UNK any authority .    3.2747552455105584
management companies which are denied access to a member state would need to re - incorporate as a different legal entity in order to be permitted in another member state .    4.222372452511718
amendments nos 49 , 50 and 51 , which share the same basis , are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation , and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors .    3.736588686372357
i would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few members this morning and , mr president , with your permission , i will do this in english .    3.3956342852579406
first of all , regarding the remarks of mr crowley , who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure isd approach ; the objections of the commission to that proposal would be the following : such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non - consistent sets of rules ; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest .    3.520609796058853
for example , a management company might be doing UNK business and , if not able to sell , it would put the securities in the fund it would manage , or else there might be difficulties in which order business should be executed if the management company did UNK business .    3.4652409486595364
furthermore the proposal put forward by mr crowley would require a change of the isd which at present - as i am sure he already knows - does not cover collective management business .    3.7649891639290853
lastly , his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render isd activities .    3.4929800206219883
as regards the question put by mr huhne , his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations .    2.916640491531676
but hedging operations are already allowed in the existing article 21 ( 1 ) of directive 611 / 85 on ucits .    3.103219382697099
so what mr huhne wants is already possible .    3.030688542390452
a question has been put by mrs villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management .    3.3230594518727097
that is also something which is allowed under present legislation . i refer to the same article 21 i referred to in relation to mr huhne ' s question .    4.286941051789367
in her question mrs kauppi asks why the commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals . the reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product , while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider , and on prospectuses for ucits .    3.970902064416457
the separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the council .    3.7195215553129835
the commission has not only to listen to parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but , as is well - known , must also deal with the council .    4.403096500225702
that is the reason why the commission has put forward these two separate proposals .    3.2781241880042584
lastly , mr balfe has complained that there are , in his opinion , too many limits in the whole proposal the commission has put forward .    3.9114433115809177
it seems to us that these limits are justified : firstly , by the need to diversify investments ; secondly , because of the UNK to the need to UNK investment at any time ; thirdly , in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds .    5.040036410068305
these are the reasons why the commission believes , because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field , that these various limits are necessary .    4.155293404795842
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place at 12 noon .    2.330697219082893
mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states    4.115968013022143
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0019 / 2000 ) by mr di pietro on behalf of the committee on citizens ' freedoms , and rights , justice and home affairs on the draft council act establishing the convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states of the european union .    2.0899187914528237
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , in letters dated 3 august 1999 and 3 december 1999 , the council called on the european parliament , pursuant to article 39 of the treaty , to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the member states aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters .    3.6207511989247774
it is thus , as you can see , a very important draft , that will effectively serve to provide the member states of the union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance .    4.344214376345265
in actual fact , there are still certain differences of opinion within the council over the type of convention , and over certain provisions contained therein .    3.8446432586932757
some of these differences have already been UNK out , but others persist .    3.9162879825597727
the spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary , but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime , which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights .    3.471030171711619
it is for this reason that , despite the many omissions in the text , the provisions set out therein could - and i say could , mr president - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens .    4.053207238129611
the commission has proposed various amendments to this end , all of which aim to systematically restructure the council proposal by suggesting a series of technical adjustments that will render the text harmonious and consistent as regards the amendments proposed .    3.468961897421494
the amendments can be UNK as follows : they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence , introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible , and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications , an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various member states of the union .    3.7378884406222075
the proposal , as formulated by the council and subsequently amended by the commission , provides for a convention based on three UNK : the first lays down guidelines for ensuring the consistency of procedures and formalities for letters UNK ; the second lists a whole series of specific requests for mutual assistance and defines the formalities and procedures which must be followed in relation to these specific types of mutual assistance ; the third and last provides for and UNK the procedures via which telephone conversations conducted by citizens in a state other than the one instigating proceedings can and must be UNK .    3.7123225375058015
mr president , international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross - border crime and crimes which are committed in one state , but the evidence for which is to be found in another .    4.324220852391467
it is nevertheless necessary to reach agreement as soon as possible on a new convention which will also take other , even more delicate issues into account : the whole issue of double jeopardy , that of UNK , and that of the credibility of one member state of the union in respect of the judicial authorities of other member states of the union .    4.139576577155773
these are thus extremely important questions , which we hope that the council will see fit to take up when formulating a new opinion .    3.942535394526304
as regards other aspects of this subject , mr president , i would refer you to my written report .    4.043543884922295
- ( es ) mr president , i want to start by saying that i am speaking on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party which i represent on this issue .    2.938713241569216
i should like to draw attention to the fact that the council is not present today .    3.2547057495769147
by contrast , i welcome the attentive presence of commissioner vitorino , as has consistently been the case since his appointment . this leads me to another point .    3.920734245877074
this house has only prepared one report on this convention . it was in fact consulted on a text which was not the text being worked on by the council and which did not contain points which had already been agreed .    3.8348275668212106
i condemn this , as well as the council ' s absence .    4.305113107146761
these are serious matters on which this house must act .    3.3229012626805297
we are about to advance into new territory where attitudes and symbols are of great significance .    2.601265160572023
a political community is reflected in the justice which it hands out .    3.523026075146923
this is why this report is so important .    3.057820714963346
it represents a step towards the area of freedom , security and , particularly , justice to which we all aspire .    3.9296979971965866
it is also an important step towards european natural justice . this will be built on mutual confidence between the member states and their respective legal systems and on the confidence of the european people in any european court .    4.13136799511952
it will also be built on scrupulous respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and on the guarantee of fair trials in particular .    3.626929658864962
it is in this respect that this house has significantly - and in my opinion rightly - altered the balance proposed by the council by firmly and decidedly supporting a reinforcement of these guarantees of fair trials in all the amendments .    4.097158279411806
mr president , as the rapporteur said , this house has concentrated on the particular issue of phone tapping in order to remove this from the convention .    3.6071685894846324
on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party , i have tabled an amendment to the motion for a resolution which asks the council to produce a text on this issue as soon as possible .    3.0251987918445358
the regulation of phone tapping in the council document was incomplete and therefore inadequate .    3.3700438326791273
yet a lack of regulation is also inappropriate and may lead to abuses in the telecommunications field . in fact , we are aware that these are already happening widely .    4.132855113076757
the other point which i must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video UNK with regard to accused persons .    4.371386213145569
again on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party , i have asked the council to produce a convention as soon as possible in order to clarify and supplement the regulation of this issue , which is frankly unsatisfactory .    4.128800059572459
apart from a few exceptions , the members of the group of the european people ' s party will vote in favour of the committee ' s amendments , and of course our own .    3.7900480982866656
the convention on mutual assistance and criminal matters , which we are examining today , is but a UNK in the great fabric of the corpus iuris of europe , which has its natural foundation in fundamental human rights and freedoms .    4.28778767323221
thus it is that legal cooperation and cooperation on criminal matters must also strictly respect fundamental rights , principles which lie at very root of our culture and our civilisation : i am thinking of fair trials , and more particularly of the rights of the defence , of the impartiality and integrity of judges , of the length of legal proceedings , for which my country , italy , unfortunately has the worst record in terms of the number of sentences handed down , of the cases pending before the european court of human rights .    4.014955031567233
restrictions on fundamental rights cannot and must not be applied to the field of law unless they are justified in that they are associated with an actual or presumed violation of criminal law .    3.9018917225638
the report that the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights has substantially amended with regard to its original formula , taking up many of the amendments we have presented , still leaves room for a certain confusion , in relation to the way in which the interception of telecommunications and video conferences are to be regulated .    3.576891086622729
the news received in recent weeks on the way in which modern technologies facilitate interceptions mean that greater attention must be paid to this issue : we would not want our reality to be even more harsh and UNK than the dark scenes UNK by UNK .    3.6708372058189656
this is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law , which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of europe we want to see .    3.654070232110297
mr president , committee amendments and political group amendments may be tabled in plenary , but not amendments from individual members .    3.275229049558918
mr schulz should be aware of this .    3.2984187837953844
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i fully understand the frustration of mr di pietro who , in a short space of time , has had to carry out an extraordinary amount of work in order to be able to submit this report to us today .    3.3641823584769512
crime in the european union has increased to such an extent that we cannot and must not content ourselves any longer with a step - by - step approach of mutual legal assistance in criminal affairs .    3.985931238705862
the european parliament is certainly not to blame for this .    3.436207896339719
it is the governments of the member states who have restricted the amount of leeway to this degree .    3.5276520710952766
as a result , the european parliament is faced with an almost impossible task .    3.433892074723915
one has to content oneself with the idea that all means , however slight , must be seized upon in order to set up better legal assistance .    4.065848102649212
by way of paradox , i could say that it would be best if as little as possible was said about this report , for the clearer we make it that only very small steps are being taken , the more the world of crime will UNK and the more the acute imbalance between organised crime and the desperate lack of judicial cooperation will become obvious .    4.167702254392799
i would therefore make an urgent appeal to the council of ministers to finally face reality , that is to say the fact that crime is developing faster than the law .    3.7313967568987643
if not , we will be fighting a running battle .    3.384281579903505
i therefore advocate further harmonisation of criminal law in the eu member states in the first instance .    4.539670281985985
in my opinion , this is the only way to fight crime effectively across all member states .    2.834833256083332
as long as this harmonisation has not been achieved , however , we need to be consistent if we want to bring about mutual legal assistance .    4.483180334101332
to this end , i had submitted an amendment stipulating that legal assistance can only be granted in the event of criminal prosecution instituted by the authorities based on facts which are punishable according to the national law of the UNK party and the member state petitioned .    4.092788610077838
the content of my amendment is , in fact , echoed in amendment no 43 , which also stipulates this condition of accrual .    3.5852027489681126
this condition of accrual is essential since , in my opinion , the principle of UNK UNK sine UNK , legality in criminal law , must be observed .    4.181378251651501
if , however , we would like to give european citizens a greater sense of security , we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation .    4.598049580594243
mr president , my group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day - to - day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs .    3.60728807530742
the aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of states or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government .    3.4969395538274974
it is precisely in the field of legal protection that the council ' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired .    3.5723702766686944
in the words of rapporteur mr di pietro , the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings .    3.3606894512665337
thanks to the agreement , it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests , whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different member states .    4.161003383142886
the chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court .    3.9047217265773924
additional measures are hence required , such as the obligation on the part of criminal UNK to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used .    3.881820282987977
the fact that the council ' s proposal UNK roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my group .    4.019638716208875
there are certainly no restrictions in its scope .    3.068048742399777
as such , the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime .    3.229571523466612
in fact , it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law .    4.0440986991135945
it is , therefore , conceivable that the european union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will UNK in the dust .    4.376103960752152
mr president , the convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned .    3.038024064033614
it pertains , among other things , to notifications , information exchanges , the temporary transfer of detainees , the UNK of property , UNK via video conferences , investigative activities and ' undercover ' activities , and the interception of telephone calls .    3.471620547006704
this is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached , and it should immediately be said that if any amendments , such as amendments nos 32 or 81 , or the revised amendments nos 70 or 71 , were to be passed , the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped , and we would vote against it .    4.136892659034012
i hope that the common sense of our fellow meps in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments .    3.429564152125348
the fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this parliament .    3.804084402223986
as commissioner vitorino will have noted in all the various speeches , the need has emerged to draw up a framework of common rules , which is to say that we cannot continue in this manner , with this disparate agenda , with these piecemeal agreements which relate to diverse sectors such as that of investigation .    4.391921930489547
what is , on the other hand , absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the community , and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible , and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement .    4.09629226829545
my thoughts turn to what may become of this community , of these conventions and judicial relations if , for example , a fascist country such as turkey became a member of the union . it would truly UNK me .    4.162702965763623
it is clear that this is primarily an issue for the igc and one that addresses an aspiration to which this parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the council and the commission .    3.6917453170581553
i believe that this first half of the year , in which we have a commissioner from portugal and portuguese presidency of the council , provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration .    4.024291434129713
it is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting amendments nos 78 and 79 , which already UNK a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences .    3.0487000508871245
on the one hand , we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote , precisely so that this convention - which , i repeat , already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning , while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum community law .    3.6427535997969374
mr president , confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level , the member states must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible .    3.1184898570877655
indeed , they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national UNK in the field of justice , over which member states have sovereign powers , and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights .    3.5927792543195456
we must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the council which , as the rapporteur himself has underlined , now claims , after years of discussion , to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months .    4.066001059589298
furthermore - and i agree with the assessment made by mr di pietro - the council ' s text would appear to be UNK with contradictions , inconsistent UNK and omissions .    4.321735956524243
it is clear that the justice sector , more than any other , cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner .    3.191726568834837
it is the opinion of our group that even the report , considered as a whole , would be the subject of much debate , notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties .    4.226623158234037
the report contains arguments that are too disparate , which do not link together smoothly , and everything thus hinges on approximations .    3.1298403595590156
we must first establish general rules and institutional certainties . only then will we be able to institute actual conventions .    3.1703366374599478
mr president , on behalf of the members of parliament on the bonino list , i intend to confirm the position that we adopted in the committee on civil liberties and am thus also announcing our vote on their behalf . it is a vote against this report , or more precisely a vote against the convention on which the report is based .    4.039580096152021
i would nevertheless like to thank the rapporteur and congratulate him on his work . he listened very closely to our arguments at the committee stage , and particularly those on the issue of respecting the rights of the defence , both at national level and at the level of cooperation on criminal law as part of european mutual assistance .    3.600674481217345
the committee and the rapporteur have incorporated nine of the eleven amendments that we presented , and these centred precisely on the rights of the defence .    3.369983222768203
this UNK us to maintain that the european parliament would have done sterling work in guaranteeing that civil rights and freedoms were safeguarded , if this were a UNK parliament and if we were , as part of this procedure , in fact co - legislators - which we are not .    4.8703485422368065
this is the problem , and it is for this reason that we are critical of the position adopted by the council , which is one we find completely unsatisfactory .    4.257438269463711
this is a task that has lasted three years , and on which we have been consulted , so to speak , as a matter of course , when this issue , as has already been stressed , comprises highly important formal and substantive facets , which called for a range of assessments , consultations , concerted actions and codecisions .    3.868793862408957
it would seem to us that the council has taken the various issues - those of legitimate interceptions , the rights of the defence , the rights of detainees and of the authorities legally UNK to request mutual assistance - a little too lightly .    4.013291089069314
we should have requested and rejected the first version of the convention , and then requested another : the majority on the committee did not want this and it is for this reason that we will vote against it , even if we hope that the amendments , which nevertheless improve the text , can be incorporated by the council - we doubt that they will be , but hope all the same that they are .    5.057383946192957
in my group , there are undoubtedly different views of mr di pietro ' s report .    4.046502743840284
i agree that it is - as has been said - a good and competent piece of work , which has been carried out under difficult conditions .    4.433646091785748
the danish members of the group cannot vote in favour of the proposal but will , on the contrary , be supporting a number of amendments , especially those tabled by the greens .    4.408530333506108
there are two reasons why we are saying no .    3.398819554151909
firstly , these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and , to my mind , the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty , which have not been fully realised . this is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support .    4.304711205373459
the other main reason , however , is that , even though we are concerned here with a convention ( and therefore with international cooperation ) , there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal . and the trend is towards creating , in the longer term , a common european area of jurisdiction , common eu criminal law and common eu administration of justice .    4.026056628678327
we would warn against that trend . we have this afsj mantra - area of freedom , security and justice - the full UNK of which lies in its establishment of eu systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character .    3.0502754036364372
mr president , i too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom , security and justice which europe will hopefully one day become .    3.520610439313204
it is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons , in which there are no frontiers to crime , but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime .    3.843975078381054
a small step - i say - but nonetheless a welcome one , for which the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the member states and in the union itself , even if these are not yet enshrined in a european union charter of rights , which we hope will soon come into being : just restrictions and guarantees because , unfortunately , existing rights are , in practice , not always respected by every public authority in every member state .    3.8393747570700953
i personally find it unacceptable , for example , for mr pinochet to be given the option to move to spain for a confrontation .    3.7386743893790335
or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link .    3.3357821892321255
these are nevertheless minor flaws , which the rapporteur did not want and which - i hope - will be remedied when this chamber comes to vote .    3.7343254873907834
the rapporteur has made laudable efforts , which should not go UNK and for which i would like to thank him .    4.138048072396136
the overall result is remarkable and i hope that the council will fully take it into account .    3.5975623542853343
there is , as has already been said , one point still to resolved , which is also the most delicate one : it concerns article 18 of the convention , which relates to the interception of communications originating in one member state , but which are directly performed by another member state , without the assistance being requested of the state in which the interception is being carried out , something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology .    4.242921794602722
this is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse .    2.8012980713088016
it could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing , but to the commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring .    3.5064176552411688
it thus merits further reflection which , at a time in which the ambivalent reports on echelon are UNK UNK of big brother , should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used , on the one hand , to safeguard the rights of the individual , and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime .    3.921378011324797
the objective is thus to achieve , as closely as possible , a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual : an objective which now specifically applies not only to the member states , but also to the union , which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom , justice and security .    3.89863315812725
this is a distant goal , but is one that can be attained in stages .    3.4899457337069193
the most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the member states , but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward , as it is a step in the right direction .    3.5342846549210596
mr president , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement .    2.301195742973002
it points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal .    3.9580642289860566
the lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty .    3.498755181876478
legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters .    3.4828234765591497
because of shoddy drafting the convention can be interpreted very widely , and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the european convention on human rights .    3.3458688268495993
article 18 allows interception in another member state without its involvement .    3.1300812952752572
not only should this be deleted , the whole interception title should be scrapped .    3.1886464723910075
an initiative of the fbi drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation .    3.55784866002506
the council proposal containing those requirements , UNK 98 was approved by this parliament last may in the schmid report .    3.408637418046389
now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception , and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at .    4.7328593887341475
the requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers , that is , telephones , mobile UNK , internet , etc . ; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting , this is open to abuse . i would also like to ask : given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception , does this include parliament ' s in - house service ?    3.9079240378495625
are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very , very shoddy grounds ?    3.4698340201246105
furthermore , in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences .    4.665050911602567
this leaves it wide open to abuse .    3.04198996457632
again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof , something which is recognised in international , fundamental law , the UNK of UNK is essential .    4.227035027758032
that is not guaranteed .    3.1454392731827676
neither the UNK nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence , a basic principle of international fundamental rights .    3.5774634936092404
this issue is extremely serious .    2.9342923693603495
we are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout europe which are extremely concerned about these developments .    3.6122991811868292
mr president , i am neither a member of the legal affairs committee nor a lawyer , but like almost all of us , i understand the need for this single economic area of europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom , security and justice .    3.462214736548877
in that sense , the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important .    3.7331233255065115
what did i understand on reading the related texts ?    3.198453355753884
that it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the council .    3.7777193836222973
the many contradictions and conflicting views over what europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations .    3.108866435125313
for example , the situation proposed by article 18 , to which many speakers have drawn attention , where each country , each large country if you will , each country with the technical ability , can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country ' s approval .    3.5027191573187273
it is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by mr di pietro could not be conveyed in the UNK five minutes he had here today .    3.4449424185790836
nevertheless , it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries , UNK and citizens , a path which i think must be pursued much more completely and much more UNK .    4.451553467933142
i should like , however , to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law .    3.677011279282123
a child , a student or a UNK who UNK UNK in one country is dealt with in an educational way , while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons .    3.5991309457446135
how can there be any cooperation on criminal matters on that basis ?    3.244309465648154
for that reason , in conclusion , i believe we should do something , particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws , not those relating to organised criminal activity , but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena .    3.930054585397416
on 14 december 1999 , a five year - old UNK called UNK was found in a UNK - car on the calais - UNK train , crying for his mother who was taking him to visit his sick grandmother .    3.3062925430282735
UNK UNK , who had probably been raped , was found with her throat cut and covered in stab UNK in the UNK on the train .    3.7150797678960403
the presumed killer , UNK UNK rezala , is also strongly suspected of having murdered the british student isabel peake , who was raped and thrown out of the train taking her to see her parents , and another young woman , UNK UNK , who was found dead in UNK under a pile of coal in the building where he lived .    3.184183325603829
rezala should never have been in france . he arrived from algeria at a time when , according to the authorities , immigration had been stopped and there was no reason for him to come .    3.9153656848524285
he should never have UNK in france , having been reported to the transport police more than 40 times for offences , which should have been enough for him to be expelled back to his home country .    3.512378944136846
he should never have been free because 14 charges of theft , violence and rape had been brought against him , one of which was for the rape of a minor .    2.8883457678246724
he should never have been able to escape from france , but the officers pursuing him had no jurisdiction and european frontiers have more holes than a sieve .    3.1055124169016657
he should never have arrived in spain , where he UNK a woman at UNK and yet was immediately released by the spanish authorities .    3.2769254170187168
today , thanks to the complex networks of sexual UNK , he is in portugal .    3.630907834521462
portugal refuses to UNK him on the grounds that he would face a longer prison sentence in france than that provided for in the portuguese penal code .    3.575803758501216
i should like to ask the portuguese minister , the president - in - office of the council , to put a stop to this scandal at once .    2.76925751695554
i should like to ask the house to wake up , at long last , to the appalling situation of the victims of policies for which the establishment , not the UNK , bears full responsibility .    4.088627316741475
mr president , this agreement deals with a sensitive issue : cooperation in the field of criminal law .    3.0117320521804523
it is therefore understandable that the council finds it difficult to agree .    3.726805677929006
successful application of this agreement by the member states requires unanimity within the council .    4.7878779668668345
only a broadly based agreement makes any sense in practice .    2.989068292046595
this , however , does not mean that the council can work on this anonymously .    4.4691461880302406
quite the reverse , in fact .    2.7167331924943454
the council ' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national member states in the field of criminal law .    3.5638405057921414
the wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test .    3.793918447086082
mr di pietro ' s proposal to UNK the current article 18 regarding UNK telecommunications , amongst other things , is understandable , although very strict .    3.590383544946892
the text of article 18 is ambiguous : he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a member state in another member state without the latter ' s prior authorisation .    3.296456700982132
in this way , member states would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the state where interception occurs and the citizens within that state .    3.640194696308721
proposed additions , such as repeated references to the echr , the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of member states to implement the echr , add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement .    4.050138623260353
i am aware of the problems but i think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text .    4.459488384536577
the dutch members of the group for a europe of democracies and diversities will , however , despite hesitation , not withhold their support for the di pietro report in the final vote .    3.9056270596254254
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation .    3.2555259450615925
this clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much - discussed european citizenship .    3.19435033757907
on one hand judicial measures fall outside the community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting .    3.9560285066069265
pursuant to article 29 of the eu treaty , the union ' s objective is ' to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom , security and justice by developing common action among the member states in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia ' .    3.6118278072146035
the creation of europol represents one step towards achieving this objective . however , we must take the next step , which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine european judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom , security and justice .    3.605342048827799
this draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application , at member state level , of pre - existing conventions on other legal areas . the intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the member states and in the european convention on human rights .    3.3556770393815145
it is this concern for basic rights , freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals . we recommend that the council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue .    3.5114931295435086
as for UNK , more precise regulations must be established so that the rights of the defence and guarantees of fair trials are safeguarded .    3.7501692281810026
the procedural aspect of the legal system must be respected by defending the rights .    4.031583215506187
( the president cut the speaker off )    1.7443676510250234
mr president , legislating in criminal matters is often UNK , wrongly , with arguments of individual freedom and security .    3.0420452889714342
is one free when security is no longer assured ?    3.9881919676687043
and this dialogue is open - ended ; it UNK to the demands of the day .    4.2201647779199885
but the council ' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts .    3.399389864467203
first , the form : the draft convention is vague in the extreme , and this is totally incompatible with the objective of legal certainty in a modern society .    3.711495678581347
it is not just a question of style .    2.741776091884782
we are taking about criminal law here and criminal law has to be interpreted by the letter .    3.712589440018742
then the content : the council draft UNK the obvious difficulty caused by widely differing legal systems , varying practices and a total lack of legal public service standards in certain member states of the union .    3.063652470242098
it makes provision in article 9 for prisoners held in custody to be transferred from one state to another despite the fact that guarantees differ .    3.5720600309344603
i should like to stress this point because it is paramount .    3.453736546090102
we must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the european union without having stood trial and that , in some states , custody is abused and used as a means of UNK UNK .    3.576300848802782
it is nothing less than legal torture .    2.734407130471073
other european countries , on the other hand , do not accept UNK as sufficient proof of guilt .    4.116323264266575
it is this diversity in our criminal policies which we have to address and legislating properly means looking for genuine legal convergence criteria and facing up to the reality of prisons in europe , which are often overcrowded places outside the law which are a disgrace to the conception we have of ourselves .    3.691183169493701
mr president , as you know , all of our countries abolished the death penalty years ago , but with nearly a thousand UNK a year in our prisons , they have not really abolished it ?    3.9053233228403896
mr president , co - operation in the field of law is without doubt essential in free market europe , but it must hinge on the strictest respect for those principles which lie at the very heart of our civilisation : the fundamental human rights and freedoms , laid down in the european convention on the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms .    3.251967590380154
we can but thank the parliamentary committees , which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far - reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which , in its initial format , we did not find at all convincing .    4.055635785731789
if it is then a question of listing the areas investigated or UNK these , they can be found with the rapporteurs , among them the author of the report on this convention .    3.680107764399912
i thus believe that mr schulz could have spared himself the effort of making certain remarks .    3.0560511845718086
as i have said , numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - i am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team .    3.2667540902870282
in brief , this parliament wanted the convention to apply solely to criminal matters ; the restrictions on freedom and on fundamental rights set out in the convention can but be limited to criminal matters .    3.6381695574378177
we need hard and fast rules .    2.666986222162543
the council has behaved in an UNK manner , changing tack in mid - course , and is nowhere to be seen .    3.1943370491677596
we would , on the other hand , like to thank commissioner vitorino for attending the debate held in this chamber .    3.938173865319921
as i have said , we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in europe - without UNK from interceptions , without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than UNK justice , and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds UNK .    3.345196238330163
. mr president , the draft convention on mutual assistance in criminal matters between the member states of the european union is approaching adoption by the council .    3.1005682238027013
according to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the council in april 1997 , the work on the draft UNK convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997 .    4.379745484255306
more time will pass before the convention actually enters into force , given the fact that this requires member states ' ratification .    4.132483979212252
even with the new rules introduced by the treaty of amsterdam , UNK its entry into force once at least half of the member states have adopted the convention , i would like to urge the member states to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this convention .    4.620557227275602
past experience with ratification of european union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing .    3.1111014398814367
this convention will not create a new or different system of mutual assistance .    3.20585972961042
instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time , such as the ones foreseen by the council of europe convention on mutual assistance of UNK and the UNK treaty .    4.19394057527389
the draft that the council has UNK contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several members of parliament .    4.189882655114903
it is a considerable achievement of the convention that where at all possible requested member states shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting member states .    3.1907312329783024
this is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court .    3.573541424017893
furthermore , requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities .    3.342345870872945
generally speaking , there are two kinds of provisions : those that create an obligation to render assistance , such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences , controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications ; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for member states that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed , for example , the provisions on joint investigation teams , UNK investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents .    3.3941806473846294
the commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques , given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime .    3.0870505393960075
it is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations .    3.3055603499296753
however , one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence .    4.501728622618662
i very much appreciate that the report of mr di pietro , whom i salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time , includes the right of defence as one of its main points .    3.850062460174468
at the present time it is entirely up to the member states to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the council of europe ' s court of human rights in strasbourg .    4.628923207343656
it remains to be seen whether this will change with the new european union charter on fundamental rights , work on which has just begun .    3.4334096037214317
we must recognise that article 18 concerns what is clearly a controversial decision .    3.0671310016723408
the article was carefully UNK in council in very lengthy discussions , in order to ensure that intelligence activities would remain effective and that criminal investigations will be covered .    3.620615562401909
as far as criminal investigations are concerned , for which i am responsible , i take note of the invitation that was addressed to the commission and the council by several members of the european parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis , having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts .    3.837191080382743
the commission is fully aware of the fact that the draft we have before us is not perfect or ideal .    3.5235980154141258
however , we must be realistic .    2.742017746917463
this is what we have , and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken .    3.827458283676551
i am quite aware of the fact that the further development of mutual trust and mutual confidence among the judicial systems of the member states will ease the road we have ahead of us .    3.527011327892601
apart from that , the tampere european council has already indicated in which direction we , in the commission , should go .    4.430644723585743
among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting - up of the euro just project .    4.466217345630757
the commission sincerely hopes that the european parliament will support its efforts to make progress in these important fields .    3.6291570859123556
i do not expect you to wave through or rubber stamp everything you are confronted with in the coming years .    2.901293659584426
i am counting more on the european parliament to be not only a critical observer , as it has been in this case , but also an active player in taking the union forward in the fight against crime .    4.268751266563832
vote    3.0905809937555753
ii . the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 85 / 611 / eec on the coordination of laws , regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ( ucits ) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses ( com ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1998 - 1998 / UNK ( cod )    2.6381077217808735
goebbels ( pse ) .    3.6897293401271996
( fr ) madam president , when a UNK , a spaniard , a UNK and a german have to negotiate in english , linguistic ambiguities will arise .    4.1392477551108255
i therefore propose , in agreement with the rapporteur , mr olle schmidt , that the words ' issued by ' be replaced with ' dealt with ' throughout amendment no 37 .    3.2456297760759107
the words ' issued by ' also need to be added after the words ' transferable securities ' .    3.7891356663034417
the amended text will then read , and again i must read it in english , which is the UNK UNK of our parliament : ' transferable securities issued by over the counter derivatives dealt with ' , etc .    3.647977894037348
we must also ensure that amendment no 45 by mr garcía - margallo y marfil is amended if it is to be adopted , because the same problem will arise .    3.419633236717415
mr goebbels , i am sorry , but i think you are UNK the UNK ; amendment no 37 is an oral amendment proposing that the words ' with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale ' be moved . you were asking for the place to be changed .    3.737004914096758
madam president , my apologies , i was looking at amendment no 36 , which logically UNK amendment no 37 .    3.1342335495884472
but , you are right , we are discussing amendment no 37 and here too we have a similar problem .    4.80640631804302
it is not the establishments but the instruments which should have a high rating .    3.7709727940827307
the text therefore reads : ' instruments with a high rating base on a recognised rating scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation ' .    2.5324909247974516
my apologies once again for my mistake .    3.3057582215202785
( parliament adopted the oral amendment )    2.1948709447759236
madam president , i asked for the floor before the sitting started in order to say something solely intended for you as president of this house . we have a procedure for visits to be made to this house to report on certain situations .    4.577280528729855
i do respect and agree with this procedure , as i also agree with the freedom of expression for everyone . however , for the second time in a fortnight these visits have been used to attack individuals , political parties , including my own , and institutions .    4.20923793014637
i feel that this behaviour , particularly in your presence , is unacceptable and totally UNK , especially when we are on the point of an electoral campaign .    3.997434090705036
therefore , particularly out of respect for you , i must say that i do not approve of this type of behaviour and in fact totally reject this .    4.058009961378523
i was told that this was a personal response .    3.736750607479998
note will be taken of it in the minutes .    4.5267687422300975
madam president , particularly out of respect for you , for myself and for this house , i did not want to explicitly refer to the issue in question . however , as a member of this house , as general secretary of a party in the basque country and as an ordinary citizen of spain , i will do so now because of the extremely serious accusations made against individuals and against parties like my own , which has a long democratic tradition , and which has scrupulously respected and defended human rights for many years .    4.229297714277155
madam president , i want to express my concern that this clear defence by mr knörr borràs of human rights apparently does not prevent his government from cooperating in parliament with a political group which not only does not condemn , but UNK with and encourages , violence against people and property .    3.353070190131923
i see that mr gorostiaga atxalandabaso is asking to take the floor on the same subject .    3.7009561081882065
we are not going to enter into a debate now .    3.4499291498055453
i shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote .    3.4196443581441094

before the vote    3.5230847256913926
madam president , i want to condemn the absence of the presidency - in - office of the council .    2.4806074965526257
on third pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom , security and justice , it is unacceptable for the presidency - in - office of the council to be absent .    3.4131496171834312
i also want to mention the translation problems , of which i will give just one example , as we do not have much time .    4.111552020869393
correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts .    3.3207470824040266
amendment no 83 in italian , which is the original version , states that ' UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK da una persona di UNK UNK o da un UNK o legale esterno ' .    3.380101483475362
the term ' legale esterno ' has been translated into french as ' avocat neutre ' . i have no idea what an ' avocat neutre ' is .    3.0927107027024845
it rather seems like a contradiction in terms .    2.932813294458418
however , in the spanish version the ' UNK ' has disappeared completely .    3.454712514140945
madam president , you have said several times that this is a very serious problem .    3.7956976306676706
quite , mrs palacio vallelersundi , this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying .    4.3327789023725725
we shall address this problem and check all the translations .    3.179737161344412
madam president , i simply wanted to add my voice to that of mrs palacio vallelersundi before the vote started , to say that i regret very much the absence of the council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the third pillar .    3.967680399669486
i should like you , madam president , to express to the council our wish that they be present at such votes in future .    4.130629698523857
quite , i am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and i shall be most happy to pass this on .    3.8020457273583257
relating to amendment no 31    4.065467532985889
madam president , in the phrase which reads ' where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned ' , the words ' under the national law of the requesting or requested member state ' should be added after ' where ' .    3.2474908458128637
madam president , in the heat of the moment i forgot to mention that , in my report on the excessive deficit procedure , the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the spanish version .    3.7495670351835844

relating to amendment no 6    3.918915256294513
. ( de ) madam president , i have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification , because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations .    3.576393448155553
i hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this .    3.242691796026429
the second sentence should read : ' . , UNK UNK UNK ' ( which is why we have this aid ) , then ' ohne UNK UNK ' ( unconditionally and ) should be deleted , and it continues as follows : ' ohne UNK von UNK UNK von UNK UNK UNK UNK werden müssen ' . ( and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries ) .    3.734231412908058
this clarification would certainly meet with our approval .    3.3243369388650525
are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment ?    3.078595543652403

   3.7318943719743674
madam president , i would like , with reference to this report , to underline the problem of translation : reference should be made to the french or italian version , since the text adopted by this parliament will also be the authoritative one for the commission .    4.2471772947100055
we have encountered several problems in some of the other languages , but have not been able to check all of these , and i would thus urge you to be mindful of problems of this type .    4.603865280519111
madam president , i voted in favour of the schmidt report on the regulation of investments in transferable securities because , as i stated in this chamber this morning , i consider it very important that the monies of the citizens of the european union be put to good use .    4.090620313210664
the vast majority of these citizens are elderly people and pensioners , who want a peaceful retirement and who , after the problems encountered during the course of their working lives , have at last found financial peace of mind .    3.5778151242276994
the regulation of investments in transferable securities , the vast majority of which are made by elderly pensioners , is thus a major step forward for the european union .    3.174645900479999
report by olle schmidt ( a5 - 0025 / 2000 )    3.294059309057143
. ( sv ) olle schmidt ' s report is an improvement on the commission ' s proposal .    2.988457464150179
i am not opposed to updating the common minimum regulations enabling a collective investment undertaking to obtain a so - called eu passport .    2.986559913756775
however , i do not consider it would be appropriate to do this before all member states have approved commissioner monti ' s proposal for minimum taxes on capital .    3.9395844690140476
in its present form , the report will contribute to further liberalisation of the capital markets , in spite of the fact that what is most important is to UNK them .    4.074779202864424
like the whole of the group of the greens / european free alliance , i have therefore voted against the proposal to amend directive no 1 and have abstained from voting on the proposal to amend directive no 2 .    3.331531996787515
brok report ( a5 - 0029 / 2000 )    3.4241847021633345
madam president , there has recently been much talk of the importance of enlarging the european union .    4.259993759994594
we have before us malta and cyprus , which are two states keen to become members .    3.6419532002426194
given that the complexity of the procedures has been greatly reduced , i voted in favour not only because this measure addresses the need for cohesion between these applicant states and the union , but also because i believe that this should be taken as an invitation from parliament to the council and the commission to ensure that cyprus and malta become fully - fledged members of the european union as swiftly as possible .    4.213665020704282
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on the pre - accession strategy for cyprus and malta , whose accession is vital to the future of the european union in the mediterranean .    2.6758201544888274
the aim of this proposal for a regulation is to set up the first programme to implement the strategy for cyprus and malta , starting in the year 2000 and lasting for five years ( 2000 - 2004 ) .    3.275630649445633
the proposal therefore aims to facilitate harmonisation of their legislation with the acquis communautaire and the correct application of the acquis communautaire .    3.0892709830752043
this new move follows on from the step taken at the helsinki european council last december , when it was decided that malta had made sufficient progress to warrant opening bilateral conferences in february 2000 , i . e . by the end of this month , in order to commence negotiations on the conditions of accession to the union and the adjustments required .    3.77600888024863
as far as cyprus is concerned , although the council stated that a political settlement would facilitate the accession of cyprus to the european union . it also stated that its decision on accession would be made without the above being a precondition , which i welcome .    3.2450068176462583
i have , in fact , always thought that insisting on a settlement of the present situation , in which one - third of this republic ' s territory is occupied by turkey , before starting negotiations with cyprus was quite unfair .    3.5026243911910413
on a more general note , it is true that the socio - economic situation in these two countries is far better than in other candidate countries .    3.911430798071897
until 1999 , this technical assistance and financial aid was provided under the fourth financial protocols ( b7 - UNK ) .    3.008819463749695
both countries also qualify for financial aid under the meda programme ( b7 - UNK ) .    2.761895947462423
during the first and second UNK of the 2000 budget , the european parliament stressed that the new ' pre - accession ' heading ( b7 - 0 ) , proposed by the commission in the preliminary draft budget , should not be limited to the candidate countries of central and eastern europe and should also be extended to malta and cyprus .    4.172810464296877
however , because of the council ' s refusal to negotiate a review of the ceiling set for heading 7 ( pre - accession ) in the financial perspectives , the european parliament agreed , by way of exception , and i stress that it was by way of exception , that this expenditure should be financed under heading 4 ( external action ) of the financial perspectives for the year 2000 .    4.2703011680168474
at the same time , the european parliament created a new heading : ' pre - accession strategy for mediterranean countries ' ( b7 - UNK ) , under which two new articles were created for the pre - accession strategy for malta and cyprus pending the commission ' s presentation , following the helsinki european council , of the necessary legal bases and a review of the ceiling for heading 7 of the financial perspectives .    3.5234958081690566
. i welcome mr brok ' s report supporting with amendments the commission ' s proposals seeking to prepare cyprus and malta for eu membership .    3.864778964922424
the package will grant around euro 15 million in total for the two countries in the current year .    3.842845686671776
it is , however , regrettable that the commission has UNK multiannual financing and decided instead to allocate funds on a yearly basis .    3.309320448069948
this is bound to have an impact on the ability of malta and cyprus to plan spending .    3.7340171854980273
the funding will provide technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of the community ' acquis ' .    3.6300889584624483
given the already advanced state of these two countries , compared to other applicants , this should easily allow them to be ' technically and UNK ' ready for membership at the end of the 5 - year programme .    3.5545152222288143
cederschiöld report ( a5 - 0020 / 2000 )    2.7271695869163497
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) as a member of the committee on economic and monetary affairs during the last parliamentary term , i welcome the adoption of this framework decision on increasing protection for our single currency .    3.539915315476995
the union should use every means at its disposal to guard against counterfeiting .    2.9532964112905042
consumers and traders are still not familiar with the euro and it would be easy for counterfeit money to be passed in supermarkets , bureaux de change and banks and not be noticed straight away .    3.485123766882021
and the fact that coins are to have a national design on one side will make them even harder to identify .    3.9708450369833805
on another level , we must ensure that community and national institutions cooperate and implement an information system to collect and exchange information on counterfeiting .    3.7131520329734946
as far as criminal sanctions are concerned , measures are needed to guarantee protection for the euro from the outset and this is the purpose of the draft framework decision on increasing protection by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting presented by the european parliament .    3.694476175805429
the purpose of the framework decision is to supplement the provisions of the international convention for the suppression of counterfeiting currency of 20 april 1929 and to facilitate its application by the member states .    3.0559708756749457
each member state must take the necessary measures to ensure that the offences set out in the framework decision are punishable .    4.657929910133451
these offences must be punishable even if they relate to UNK and coins UNK in euros but not yet issued and if they are committed before 1 january 2002 .    3.4352142272320836
this is a basic element of the decision .    3.3365415667723686
we must bear in mind that national currencies could continue to change hands for another 20 years !    2.959447027785844
they should therefore be protected by criminal sanctions against counterfeiting once they have been withdrawn from circulation .    3.0282215681617557
it would also appear to be in the union ' s interest for all member states to help protect the euro , especially sweden , denmark , the united kingdom and greece , which will not be introducing the euro on 1 january 2002 .    4.720104357569101
although this framework decision is a step in the right direction , it confines itself to increasing criminal sanctions by harmonising substantive criminal law in the form of minimum standards .    3.1594263883519385
there is still no uniform criminal legislation on counterfeiting and there are 15 different national systems .    3.326499664323254
that brings us back to the more general need to approximate criminal law called for by the european council in tampere .    3.6853330530611963
.    2.4274255028413507
( da ) mrs cederschiöld ' s report reflects an extremely UNK form of logic . the eu introduces a common currency .    3.470997364179584
the risk of counterfeiting increases . counterfeiting of the euro is perceived as an offence against the entire eu ; the punishment must therefore be the same in each member state .    3.3346595987980376
the harmonisation of criminal law or the introduction of minimum legal standards should not be UNK against the background of problems of one ' s own creation but from considerations of reason and necessity .    3.831197176110832
there is nothing to indicate that the member states ' legal principles , legal traditions and carefully tailored legal systems should be lost for reasons to do with an already familiar offence such as counterfeiting . nor , in the light of the international convention of 20 april 1929 , can there be any confusion as to which country should deal with any criminal cases .    3.226852710748881
we are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the UNK of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such UNK grounds . instead , the focus should be upon preventing the real problem .    3.53718168387811
. i welcome this proposal to protect the euro against UNK .    3.9509415571283273
when the notes and coins come into circulation after 1 january 2002 , everything possible must be done to ensure maximum confidence in the euro .    3.5181872738383237
di pietro report ( a5 - 0019 / 2000 )    3.1647158082672844
madam president , as the representative of the pensioners ' party , there have been many occasions on which i have stated , at the committee stage , that the european union must intervene in regulating the lives of the elderly , and in the measures and rules on pensions , as is already the case , in coordination .    4.175762881018152
i believe that we , the parliament of the european union , who are the elected representatives of the citizens , must give UNK impetus to ensuring that the european union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens , including that of justice , and that of pensions .    4.588859498893639
.    2.4274255028413507
that means , making a european bugging system like the transatlantic UNK operation ' echelon ' perfectly legal .    2.8733444829595034
this convention will lead to gross abuses of people ' s rights to UNK .    4.196831303030524
also the following points are unacceptable for us : joint investigation teams , controlled deliveries , undercover investigations , UNK of the text on the scope of the convention , lack of respect of the principle of proportionality , lack of democratic guarantees .    4.032615653989154
resolution on the commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005    3.5007046710491094
. commissioner prodi pointed out that ' africa is our responsibility ' and not apparently that of the usa and other major countries .    3.8023561475937133
i worked in africa 30 years ago , and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic .    3.880006771653113
two million people died of aids in africa last year , approximately 200 000 died in wars .    3.2574662656903466
in zambia 25 % of teachers have died of aids .    3.386212300666336
in some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today .    2.963412887151099
our policies in africa lack coherence .    3.542205554922515
there is huge duplication of effort .    3.0130129052861334
furthermore , the UNK of debt remains an obstacle to real development .    3.7424959372257214
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) in its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 , the commission repeats that europe needs to become a ' global actor ' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world .    2.873816628414892
what should this global actor ' s objective be ?    3.309890003202456
doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of ' to defend the countries of europe better ' , since that is the traditional and UNK purpose of political associations .    3.5678089219362157
and yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen .    2.8484834948742024
all we find are vague phrases about ' strategic partnerships ' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of europe would apparently bring with it .    3.2684881446472045
the omission of this principal objective is highly revealing .    3.3419211886857103
it demonstrates one of the main flaws in the european union , a little - known , almost always UNK flaw , but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens ' loss of interest .    4.04468722644788
there is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines .    4.288440265390756
addressing the fundamental question of relations with the united states , the commission mentions just one priority : ' we will endeavour to reduce and eliminate as far as possible the disputes in transatlantic trade ' ( page 4 ) .    3.6162157904657537
while we are on the subject , where one would expect a firm declaration of intent to defend european interests in the numerous trade conflicts under way , one merely finds the desire to eliminate conflict , which hardly sounds like determination on the part of the commission to fight its corner .    3.585455369120346
how strange that the commission should lose its instinct for self - preservation just as europe is integrating .    3.4808688605475244
i think there are three reasons for this : 1 ) in their endeavour to transcend the nation states , the european institutions have lost touch with the people and , in losing touch with the people , they have become UNK in the hands of foreign interests ; 2 ) having lost touch with the people , the men and women working in these institutions have started to become used to reasoning not as the sole UNK of the people , but as international officials in charge of regulating a global system ; 3 ) integration may afford economies of scale and productivity gains ; but it also causes far more to be lost because , when it breaks nations , it breaks UNK expressions of solidarity and , with them , the willingness to present a united front .    3.92392392343726
. ( fr ) i share the overriding sense of deep and keen dissatisfaction expressed during the debate .    2.7730377130808797
i do , of course , understand the constraints of the moment and i am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure .    4.199327102218655
however , experience has taught me that , in politics , modest ambitions are never the key to success !    4.011500365680454
i shall not keep saying that i am disappointed , because you need to hope in order to be disappointed . and i have had no hope since the investiture debate .    4.123339295082655
as for the future , given that the commission has shown itself incapable of taking action against fascism in austria , i am convinced that blocking measures to liberalise the single market is the only way of UNK a salutary electric shock treatment to the heart of all the countries in the union .    4.318327752390357
- ( it ) on behalf of the italian communists , i would like to express great dissatisfaction at the contents of the document , which was expected to define the strategic guidelines for europe up until the year 2005 .    3.8548994078673458
employment : for many years now , the connection between economic growth and an increase in employment has not been borne out by reality , and yet , despite the fact that it has been proved to be useless , the same UNK is being put forward again as a solution to the acute problem of unemployment .    4.44863117026338
and yet our president is a fine UNK .    3.325234464461349
pensions : the document states that , ' member states must remain responsible for modernising social protection systems ' , and yet the commission itself intervened in the case of italy , repeatedly calling for swift changes to the pension system to reduce rights and decrease pension payments .    3.783323063014498
and yet president prodi himself gave firm guidance to the italian government during those years and is therefore aware of the nature and extent of the sacrifices demanded of our fellow citizens and which they made in order to sign up to the euro , and he is aware of the major role played by italy in european development .    4.075327928244151
for this very reason , we cannot agree to cut pensions further .    3.686442770742545
there is an agreement on this issue which provides for a review in 2001 and this must not take place one moment sooner .    3.8943981313893836
what is more , the relevant cost dynamic is completely under control .    2.6656720539767362
i would therefore ask the commission to please refrain from taking this unacceptable ideological approach and making such declarations which create instability and uncertainty among the citizens .    2.647947189156114
i referred to the case of italy , not only because the president is very familiar with it , but because community statistics ( eurostat ) themselves reveal that not only has italy ' s welfare expenditure - currently 25 . 9 % - been below the community average ( 28 . 2 % ) since 1990 , but that it has also been well below that of countries considered to be doing well , such as germany ( 29 . 9 % ) and france ( 30 . 8 % ) .    3.845541822300893
europe ' s role : we first need to emphasise that europe rejects war as an instrument for resolving international conflict : only then can we talk of the ' military ' role of the union .    3.5764642429598767
agriculture and health : we see the issue differently from the commission : in our view there are no consumers : there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health , quality and respect for the environment .    4.027424266015155
moreover , these are factors which create employment .    3.6226626886455384
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) the proposed action and programme presented by mr prodi are vague in the extreme and the social question is missing yet again .    3.2129453955884135
in fact , the word seems to have been UNK from the commission ' s vocabulary , whereas liberal and american references UNK .    4.058102524701613
mr prodi UNK to the contested concept of ' governance ' ; contested because it favours state intervention over a proper working democracy and refers to the notion as defined by the imf , whose ideological agenda is UNK solely on liberalism and monetarism .    3.108663686119357
the shift in meaning is not just UNK . the only logical thing to do on reading this document is to pursue the mass market and generalised deregulation and forget about the UNK of european policy which our citizens hoped for .    3.947945077919395
mr prodi talks solely of ' mechanisms ' and ' structures ' and fails to set out a single balanced project which responds to the aspirations of our people .    3.176567721564593
enlargement appears to be an end in itself , but unless decisions are made on a social policy , a common value and an institution to strengthen the cohesion and democratisation of the union , the europe bequeathed to us at the end of mr prodi ' s presidency may well be a simple common market area within the context of generalised globalisation , rather than the community of destiny which we hope for .    4.367892784785686
finally , mr prodi ' s complacency towards the austrian government in the name of an exaggerated sense of protocol ( which in no way obliges him to send a message of congratulations ) would in itself warrant a vote of no confidence .    3.4589381570848787
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) the european union is UNK its unbridled expansionist ambitions .    3.224641554023069
the commission ' s objective for the next five years is to become a ' global actor ' by showing ' genuine leadership on the world stage ' .    3.2136189935014006
the nature of the eu has not changed .    4.987577561874321
since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups .    3.56737464885305
but the prodi commission now wants to transform the eu so that it can apply for joint global governance with the united states , which it also sees as its future competitor and rival .    3.5798326758449215
this new imperial policy advocates reorganising european and national institutions , strengthening the power of the state , increasing competition , establishing a european army and redistributing financial resources .    3.2822885500461054
even daring to refer to the defence of a ' european social model ' is a UNK lie because the more the eu UNK the united states , the more it becomes its UNK .    4.345685939994518
a european charter of fundamental rights would be the only UNK of light in this policy but , yet again , there is no provision for the people of europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically .    4.396499776998822
we abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons .    2.9412996642659053
firstly , the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the commission ' s programme .    3.197824734637079
secondly , in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years , we consider that the main question to be considered by the commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the eu which neither the programme nor the motion mention .    4.416483076685902
in our opinion , the commission ' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the european political initiative being returned by the governments of the member states following the santer commission scandal .    4.261324273558618
this is very positive as this is how the national parliaments , on which the governments depend , will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to european construction .    3.8130428209987444
the truth is that the european parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about europe , as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections .    3.5641341309517305
the mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the member states must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent , more transparent and more democratic .    4.146234793300136
we welcome the efforts of mr prodi to improve the public image of the commission and the need for the latter to agree with this house and the council .    5.32365267770475
however , the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms , particularly by creating a council of ministers for europe which , by itself and in coordination with the other european institutions , can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the european councils into specific actions .    4.322032935598731
corrie report ( a5 - 0032 / 2000 )    3.25207628061794
madam president , the work of the acp - eu joint assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models UNK from the lomé conventions .    3.154895396643221
back in 1994 , the joint assembly passed an initial resolution , in which our fellow member dominique souchet was closely involved , expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the UNK round , which contradicted the very principle of community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation .    3.826354926281311
these fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them .    3.3633095349009676
the developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade , despite their vulnerable economies .    3.4732437330015045
although mr corrie ' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the joint assembly ' s attachment to the lomé model , he fails to highlight properly a second problem which , to tell the truth , is also the result of the free - trade error , namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the european union .    3.8160877394956025
the cooperation agreement with south africa is a prime example .    3.4221749560210033
the council approved the agreement negotiated by the commission despite the fact that a basic section , namely agriculture , had not been finalised .    3.965373358834148
as paul - marie coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments , one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents .    3.073997005517148
it is most worrying , especially as a similar agreement with mexico appears to be taking shape .    3.417250160927448
nor is it possible to support the rapporteur ' s call for the european development fund to be merged with the community budget .    4.321129547403974
we want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each member state , which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature .    4.422817145405324
alas , there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no - one feels responsible being UNK and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the edf .    4.150940898747355
madam president , i welcome mr corrie ' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the assembly has carried out over the last year .    3.9147417125977757
the report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing lomé convention , which expires at the end of this month .    3.1991142546117777
the new agreement provides for a development budget of eur 13 . 5 billion over the next seven years .    2.9412821901665622
it is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the acp countries .    3.186571852827264
UNK efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste .    3.3016087765592284
civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects .    3.564675149877225
the decision to include a clause obliging acp countries to take back illegal immigrants entering europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity .    3.7568710380578807
i hope that before the end of this new lomé convention we will be able to welcome cuba as a full member .    4.210765001021009
. the joint united nations programme on aids estimated that by the end of 1998 , there was a total of 33 . 4 million people in the world living with the hiv infection .    3.7656274766694113
over 95 % of all hiv infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub - saharan africa is the worst affected region in the world .    3.277965412261615
while only around 10 % of the world ' s population live in sub - saharan africa , 70 % of all people who became infected with the aids virus in 1998 live there .    3.2006057712303058
80 % of the 13 . 9 million aids related deaths in the world have taken place in this region .    3.964946862484711
the aids problem in africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one .    3.7330430633992817
the effects of the aids pandemic mean that any progress in development matters in the sub - saharan region is being UNK or reversed .    3.39069642487351
from the data which i am referring to today , it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate UNK on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide - ranging impact .    4.068785461653852
it is clear that the spread of aids in the sub - saharan african continent is linked to poverty .    2.865701325675219
aids UNK that may cost $ 18 000 per annum for one person are obviously not affordable by countries whose annual health budget may be less than $ 5 per capita .    2.9137049055226836
it is incumbent on the european union and the united nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner .    3.987521784747622
we must primarily ensure that the basic needs of the poorest people in the countries most affected by the aids disease are fully met . these countries include ethiopia , UNK , mozambique , tanzania , UNK and zambia .    4.747303926108317
prevention education should begin early in the primary school UNK in these countries .    3.407443926440318
appropriate messages about the health effects of aids must be delivered to primary school children by teachers who are comfortable with the information that they are trying to communicate .    3.449097424212794
health facilities and staff of ngos need to be supported and resourced to deal effectively and appropriately with patients .    3.6192824466034716
it is essential that these groups are able to obtain the limited resources they require to be effective .    3.3036125561689444
at a more central level , there is a need for more effective co - UNK between government donors , international ngos , indigenous ngos and private sector initiatives so that scarce resources are not wasted .    3.0774224780197037
already weak economies are being further weakened in africa by the aids virus .    3.306815894065286
already stretched resources are being further stretched .    3.5936970452545767
50 % or more of hospital beds are now occupied by someone suffering with an aids related disease in the countries where aids figures are highest .    3.295158303222108
on a separate matter altogether , i would like to support cuba ' s membership as an acp country within the framework of the new lomé convention which will shortly be agreed between the european union and african , caribbean and pacific countries .    3.7064282545831713
i know that this is somewhat controversial , particularly , because of the attitude of the united states government towards the castro regime .    4.006841557006201
however , on this occasion , the european union will be insisting on introducing political criteria into the lomé convention accord .    3.7973005860075593
good governance criteria broadly covering questions of refugees , corruption , human rights and democracy will be part of the finalised accord between the european union and all countries signing the lomé convention from africa , the caribbean and the pacific region .    3.751505302505328
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) the lomé convention , on which the entire structure of relations between the european union and the 71 african , caribbean and pacific countries rests , is still the most efficient and ambitious development tool in north - south relations .    3.1330774633507508
after years of ' good and UNK service ' it is still the main symbol of efforts by the european union to promote development and improve the lot of the poorest countries .    3.6138603802454883
and the merit of mr corrie ' s report is that it highlights the value of this original , proactive development instrument , together with the work carried out by the joint assembly .    3.450159180929014
especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened .    3.3260885797120636
the partnership between the european union and the acp was negotiated in the difficult time of the changeover to the new millennium .    3.9316675314541194
i am delighted that reason and generosity triumphed over the difficulties , opening new prospects for this partnership .    2.9077169167361414
now , more than 30 years after the inauguration of an unprecedented partnership between north and south , the tool which has proven its worth and served its time needs to be adapted in order to meet new challenges .    3.549693357602863
which is why the new 20 - year agreement due to be signed in UNK on 31 may represents more than the simple renewal of the conventions regulating relations between europe and the acp .    3.7496963731867456
it should seal their revival .    3.036746014373061
it UNK illustrates the political dimension of a partnership which constitutes the only forum for dialogue and political exchange within north - south relations .    2.8499901386058966
at a time when the joint assembly is opening its doors ever wider to the elected representatives from parliaments in the acp , this dimension must not only be preserved ; above all , it must be encouraged .    3.7123398474876392
the joint assembly also represents the tribunal before which the countries of europe and the developing countries defend their common interests .    3.84043767416536
after the debacle in seattle , our duty from now on is to adopt a concerted position and ensure that the rules of world trade develop and are used to fight poverty .    3.8509753543187126
the partnership is here to stay and the way is clear for it to be modernised .    4.069396363552426
first , by promoting a trend towards regional meetings of the joint assembly , as recommended in the corrie report , thereby enabling working methods to be adapted to the new types of cooperation envisaged ( regional economic partnership agreements ) .    3.3491006739463915
then , by UNK actions to micro - projects and making them accessible to the civil society in the southern countries and , finally , by calling for enlargement and the rapid accession of cuba , which all the acp called for at nassau and which has now made a formal application .    3.9884661499932856
but we must also preserve the original spirit of the lomé convention , which has enabled relations between the european union and the acp to become what they are today : a real partnership based on fairness and mutual respect .    3.5207489370689866
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) a few days after the demonstrations in seattle , the ministers of the european union imposed an agreement compatible with the rules of the wto on the acp , i . e . their former colonies .    4.001343712994947
apart from reducing the volume of exports from these countries to the community market , what we term ' development aid ' to the acp has fallen constantly , from 70 % of total european union aid in 1986 to 30 % in 1998 .    3.6526979519544733
the european union prefers to send its funds to eastern europe , the former ussr and asia , where there is greater opportunity for profit .    3.6133409126544627
the acp - eu agreements make a mockery of democratic principles and the fight against corruption , by sparing those who are responsible : when will sanctions and controls be imposed on total - elf , which is supplying those responsible for the civil war in the congo ?    3.7277122162551213
or on shell ?    3.5788796595088828
although the market is presented as the only rule which applies to acp - eu relations , the european union also plans to police immigration , as article 13 UNK , in order to justify the policy of the european states against illegal immigrants .    4.624897646500892
we do not accept this agreement , which UNK people of the wherewithal to build societies which are independent of the european multinationals and banks .    4.450195061894699
few of my constituents will probably be aware that the eu is the biggest foreign aid donor in the world .    4.012823299850071
while others may have the biggest UNK , the eu has the deepest pockets .    4.32491925630535
this is something that the eu can rightly be proud of , and i think we should shout it from the rooftops more often .    3.9364587959190045
the labour government ' s record in britain is also a proud one .    3.7377404943308483
UNK short , mp , is one of the few cabinet - level ministers for international development in the world and , as such , can take her case to the very heart of government .    4.034754835651622
whether through the minimum wage in manchester or debt relief in UNK , labour ' s aim of poverty reduction remains the same .    2.9271308507489793
there is still much to be done , however .    3.5037240854883756
the next great challenge is to re - launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last december in seattle .    3.1550308212754237
it must be a ' development round ' , in which developing countries , effectively excluded from previous rounds , are fully included .    3.6728108195719575
for the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves .    3.1631751895204285
developing countries want trade not aid , a help up not a hand - out .    3.321069729563169
and the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products .    3.1988526867954583
in this way , the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good , to benefit the poor not just the wealthy , the many not just the few .    3.695994448931022
thus , whether through the new deal in UNK or fair trade in UNK , labour ' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same .    3.1219025197462953
swoboda report ( a5 - 0031 / 2000 )    3.2625382807335326
. ( el ) the eu ' s stabilisation and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia , in the form of a joint agreement as established by article UNK of the eu treaty , can contribute to the stabilisation and development of that balkan republic .    3.632593327825712
in parallel , it can benefit from substantial financial support via the phare programme .    3.4856619782776463
however , the eu ' s present policy in the balkans is fragmentary , inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature .    3.8551440609667385
there are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach .    3.251421708167276
there is no sense of UNK for the balkans , which would include everyone without exceptions or UNK .    3.954212922601195
finally , intervention by the european union to solve the problem of fyrom ' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more UNK - and to respond more UNK towards negotiating fyrom ' s principles within a reasonable time scale , is necessary and useful .    3.623781240672009
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) the commission ' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the european union and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the community would appear to respond to a primary concern : a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south - east europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the second world war .    2.972782489338874
having been crushed UNK the UNK of UNK communism , this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s .    3.4459489578775635
and yet , under these difficult conditions , especially since the military intervention in the balkans by nato , some of these genuinely european countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which UNK them to aspire to join the community .    3.7875313999881763
in this sense , the former yugoslav republic of macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case .    2.585663418562662
exemplary because it proves that the balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the european union in stability and association agreements .    4.101320695856861
symbolic because it reflects well on the fifteen ' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region ( bosnia - herzegovina , croatia , federal republic of yugoslavia , fyrom and albania ) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement .    3.600209010415458
the uen group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the former yugoslav republic of macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states . a satisfactory solution cannot be found in the balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned ; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion .    3.3201645787992375
the union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to UNK a platform of common values with it , of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone .    3.5988369051021554
it is not its job to UNK to people in their choices or , failing that , reinvent a new variation on a ' sense of history ' which UNK self - determination as a one - way street .    3.092882265327193
the community construction only makes sense if it creates positive UNK alone , and the uen group hopes that this signal to fyrom and specific action in its wake will help us make a sustainable contribution to the development and peaceful coexistence of the nation states in this fully - paid up part of europe .    3.531122858406711
frassoni report ( a5 - 0021 / 2000 )    3.251777995533051
. ( da ) the danish social democrats in the european parliament have today voted in favour of mrs UNK frassoni ' s report , according to which the european parliament is to accept the agreement entered into with the commission about the implementing provisions for the council ' s decision of 28 june 1999 concerning comitology .    3.6801250107506145
in all matters , we attach importance to the fact that there should be the greatest possible transparency in connection with the decision - making procedures involved in eu cooperation , for example with a view to guaranteeing the necessary democratic control .    4.3459092456796355
through the agreement , the european parliament will automatically be sent the relevant material in connection with decisions made in accordance with the rules under article UNK of the treaty .    3.9821416133970544
we should also like to see this arrangement extended to other areas in which , following the agreement , the european parliament ' s relevant committees will be sent material when they ask for it .    3.966969397687769
with the approval of this agreement , we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned . however , it constitutes real progress in the right direction , which is something we do not wish to obstruct .    4.66399348322146
( the sitting was suspended at 1 . 23 p . m . and resumed at 3 p . m . )    1.8880168227825649
company restructuring in europe    3.955846847978289
the next item is the commission statement - company restructuring in europe .    2.373562667109884
. mr president , industrial change , which can be gradual or sudden , is driven by new technologies , worldwide competition or consumer preferences .    3.4920970455988973
it has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion , but it also provides major new opportunities when anticipated , prepared for and managed .    3.660778395766049
the UNK of technological progress and the increasing competitive pressure of globalising markets are pushing companies to rapidly adapt their production and company structures .    3.0345251685246595
companies must be able to anticipate and identify at an early stage what they need to do to ensure the continuity of their activities .    4.409661461613738
sometimes this calls for mergers of activities .    3.2352657920765684
the commission is acutely aware of this situation and of the need for people to feel basic security in difficult times of change .    4.234575078938324
we are convinced that the cornerstone of successful adaptation to change is dialogue at all levels and with full and transparent information as its basis .    2.9638357111576834
we have had in the recent past different experiences and approaches on how to deal with large - scale operations of corporate restructuring , often affecting the lives of large numbers of european people .    3.2900327641351876
in some cases these operations were prepared well in advance , fully involving workers ' representatives , with due care being taken to search for the least damaging solutions .    2.91974222906152
where necessary , workers likely to be affected were prepared through employability measures to face the challenge of sudden unemployment .    3.332366944869035
in other cases these operations were launched and implemented with less care and concern for those affected .    2.9682856863863893
on every occasion , and as recently as last october in this house , the commission has highlighted the following basic positions .    4.234811726129276
firstly , decisions on corporate restructuring remain the prerogative as well as the responsibility of management .    3.7233706690620707
this means that , when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences , job losses for example , companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution .    3.2336611020511
secondly , when UNK prove to be inevitable , the utmost must be done to reinforce the employability of those concerned .    3.4327460522496596
this requires anticipation , timely preparation and careful management of these processes .    2.9775265415100143
thirdly , nothing can justify the absence of timely , effective and comprehensive information and consultation of the workers ' and employees ' representatives before such operations are launched or publicly announced .    3.1325455397440503
worker involvement is always , and particularly in the event of corporate restructuring , not only a basic right but a necessary precondition for the social acceptance of such operations .    4.158907593286998
in the end it is also a decisive factor of their success , as no collectivity can survive and prosper without trust , dialogue , partnership and solidarity between its different components .    3.252157193889997
these basic ideas meet with a wide consensus in europe .    3.43369221332704
this is what intelligent restructuring is about .    2.8754419379811935
it is more and more rare to see companies embark on damaging restructuring operations ignoring these fundamental concerns , as unfortunately was sometimes the case in the past .    2.812542347340437
we have built a wide range of instruments which meet these concerns in recent years in the european union .    3.319341224786317
we have set minimum requirements at european level , which all member states and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses , especially when they are massive , or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers .    3.7691756960969425
the collective redundancies and transfers of undertakings directive and the european works council directive constitute our legal framework , protecting the workers ' rights and ensuring fair standards in the field of information and consultation at national and transnational level respectively .    3.946963285279071
as regards the national and / or local level of employee involvement , the commission wishes to underline again the need for proper information and consultation of employees ' representatives before any redundancies are decided or implemented , as provided for in the collective redundancies directive and in other national provisions .    3.497474043624879
i wish to recall that it is , in principle , up to national courts to deal with possible violations of these rules , if and when they are brought before them by national representatives .    4.384093743022717
however , even when existing rules or arrangements are formally respected this does not mean that management ' s attitude is socially UNK .    3.228226654009226
in fact , the commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today .    4.408039936278905
in a world characterised by permanent change and in the context of high levels of unemployment , the rules in force seem to us to be outdated as they do not allow or promote the key ideas behind our employment strategy and our approach to change , anticipation , risk prevention and employability .    3.626776817516835
that is why in november 1998 the commission presented a proposal for a directive on worker information and consultation which has since then received your strong support .    3.134479776901684
we thank you for that .    4.155783868254643
unfortunately , the other branch of the legislative power , the council , has not yet - more than one year after the presentation of the proposal - begun working on it .    4.574150407522682
i hope that this debate contributes to reminding member states of the importance and urgent nature of this initiative .    3.9031769693417506
we have recently heard from the portuguese presidency that a serious debate on this proposal will soon be launched .    4.233936753593519
the forthcoming french presidency also seems willing to give this dossier the high priority it deserves .    3.112906855488331
the commission sincerely hopes that parliament and the council quickly UNK this important dossier which constitutes , in our view , the most effective answer to the concerns raised by cases such as the ones which brought us here today .    3.6320849044451076
as for the transnational level of employee involvement there is some indication that at least in one case the companies may have breached transnational information and consultation agreements which they had concluded with their european workforce .    3.2472026884089007
they may have at least exploited some ambiguity in the legal and contractual framework in force .    3.3887663959446845
the commission will contact the relevant national authorities to check this .    3.483558064604276
in any case , i wish to say to those who believe that their rights in that respect were ignored that adequate means of enforcement and redress are available to them , notably through relevant national UNK instances .    3.528587659858324
the commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately with a revision of the european works council directive .    3.2222055831223395
as recognised in the report , which we will adopt in the forthcoming weeks , we accept that the directive contains some loopholes .    4.623908438354593
nevertheless , as my colleague , commissioner diamantopoulou has already underlined on other occasions , when deciding whether or not to revise the directive immediately , different considerations must be taken into account .    3.129735125152485
first , any revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements , unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the negotiating parties no longer applies .    3.4800753633336274
secondly , an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like european company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal .    3.5252710748888396
that is why we tend to consider that it might be more appropriate in this context to proceed with the revision of the european works council directive only after the conclusion of those two dossiers and following a more complete evaluation of the application of the directive .    3.680686945595011
action is not limited to legislation .    3.688498761858052
to encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the commission is also developing the recommendations of the UNK report by preparing the setting up of a european observatory on industrial change .    3.8056107063296576
we are also developing another suggestion of that expert group , the managing change report .    3.0264830886363017
let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this house .    4.064653849747749
as for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy , let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers ' representatives to be heard by the commission in the framework of the relevant procedure .    3.908325551612568
generally speaking , we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations , including their effects in terms of employment .    3.6440207534387463
as an example of this i mention that public authorities , notably the commission , have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 january this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment .    3.685993179794233
to this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years .    3.037834355586338
the same provision was included in the structural funds regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds .    3.776164300753547
social cohesion and the UNK of policies at eu - level is the focus of the forthcoming lisbon summit .    4.302887647750789
i know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in europe .    3.8433563293158994
thank you very much commissioner .    2.513441642632881
mr gorostiaga atxalandabaso , i understand you have a point of order .    3.526469821652428
if it is a personal statement , would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate , at which stage i would be happy to call you ?    4.691087519850679
mr president , the problem is one of public honour in this parliament , it is not a personal statement .    4.654204338267714
this morning , the president of parliament , mrs nicole fontaine , repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order .    3.397606055531153
unfortunately , this is not the first time that madam president has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me .    2.9394939208580433
in doing so , madam president has breached rule UNK that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak .    3.2469007598757544
she has also breached rule UNK that gives the right to all the members of this house to make observations , observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy , mr vidal - quadras .    3.72601629601089
this partisan behaviour of our president should be criticised most firmly .    3.137025561248577
i will willingly accept madam president ' s apologies any time .    2.8297092306591534
thank you for your statement .    2.360431287975617
we will certainly make sure that the president is informed of your statement .    3.4806897218086656
i can assure you that as far as i am aware the president never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote .    3.698295669207107
therefore the house was probably quite willing to go ahead at that stage .    3.3945319813220216
but thank you for your remarks .    3.881923358310282
mr president , i welcome commissioner liikanen ' s words , and i am contributing to the debate - we are all contributing to the debate - because , although the subject is broad in scope , it also concerns a specific fact .    4.1624952843653
the subject in question is of great political and social importance .    4.267547966594172
free enterprise , free movement and free competition are essential pillars of the political and economic structure of the european union .    3.818417473063191
company restructuring is part of the principle of free determination of investments , and must therefore be defended .    4.635346778455864
however , all too often we witness events which are in stark contrast with these principles .    3.3911630313698984
today , we are witnessing one of these cases , which , on the surface , may seem to be of minor importance and affect only the specific industry , but which , if it is allowed to pass without an authoritative intervention by the european union , will become an UNK rule which will cause problems for many of the member states and the union as a whole .    4.369958764059016
an american company - goodyear - with production sites in italy , germany and england , is reviewing its production and relocation , justifiably , in its own view .    3.1339295569372423
however , it seems to be doing it without observing the relevant community legislation , for it is certainly not giving reasonable notice to employees or UNK the obligation to render an account of their use of italian and european public finances .    3.6228745111731206
in italy , commissioner liikanen , goodyear is not carrying out restructuring but closing a plant whose production covers 14 % of the market and which goodyear itself defined as , ' having the most highly - skilled workforce of all its plants ' , a plant which was opened with a total of eur 85 million of european capital .    3.2011274580429725
no notice was given of the closure , and no intention was shown of discussing the fate of the plant or its workers , despite the fact that the public funds invested in that plant make it much more public than private .    3.3630019188299234
it would be a serious matter if every non - european company were to learn to use europe as a bus where you do not have to pay for the ticket , you do not have to pay for cooperation , you benefit from using the facility and you leave without being accountable to anyone .    3.271267510617558
europe has to guarantee every sort of freedom , including freedom to use one ' s own money for the purposes of one ' s own freedom and not to let others use it at will , others who make demands and then , when the break is made , refuse even to discuss the terms of the break , despite the fact that this is a break which has been declared unilaterally .    4.193992787278179
just now , commissioner liikanen was talking of restructuring which must not be UNK .    3.894785137860469
sadly , in this case , he has not taken into account those who are affected and seems not to have considered those carrying out the restructuring .    4.3052094303232336
i would also like to point out to commissioner liikanen that it is not easy to take a matter to a national court .    3.511553166449162
of course , it is always possible , but when jobs have been lost and factories closed down , the idea of going to court when proceedings are as lengthy as they are in italy is not very reassuring .    3.81482757159076
commissioner liikanen , we expect an authoritative intervention .    3.2903837375135243
as parliament , we are , of course , expecting to be able to contribute to the resolution you mentioned - we are ready and waiting - but we expect an authoritative intervention on this , which can on no account be allowed to reach its conclusion and be forgotten , as has almost happened already .    4.529928436926885
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , for the second time within the space of four months , we find ourselves debating the restructuring of companies in europe .    2.6759180979754205
this is - as it was the first time round - UNK off by the reorganisation of large companies , which is linked to a drop in employment .    4.630808180028741
i would like to make it quite clear that the liberal group is against any political interference in companies , in terms of both finance and management .    3.1403814535933883
our task is to draft legislation and to monitor to ensure that it is observed .    4.264618352580073
it appears that goodyear in italy received italian and european subsidies to the tune of approximately eur 40 million .    2.9310041108684977
the company went under despite this .    3.1634023795867803
this goes to show that jobs cannot be bought .    2.9176074499273112
the market is a law unto itself .    3.069722674237941
as such , state aid costs the government twice : first in subsidies and then in unemployment benefit .    3.147653507699126
surely this cannot be the role of your , my and the citizens ' tax money ?    4.497424996915574
my group is also opposed in principle to the naming of specific companies in this resolution , for two reasons : firstly because this creates selective responsibility .    3.2193431394838825
a company is pilloried one day and not the next .    3.9365215486884004
why should this be the case ?    4.061399270481329
michelin caused a great stir .    3.778189048583924
but i did not hear a UNK when UNK and UNK were discussed , where , similarly , a great number of european employees were involved .    3.941297060345494
secondly , this is not fair towards employees of other companies where UNK also take place and where it hurts too .    3.773205978810706
my group has signed a joint resolution with epp and uen , in which , however , we made it clear right from the outset that we are against the naming of company names .    4.38630546346376
this is why the liberal group will vote against paragraph 8 and the second section of paragraph 9 .    3.2834072476490834
if these paragraphs are nonetheless adopted , my group will abstain from the final vote .    2.8853771034479845
i do hope that this will not be necessary .    3.9708063708891927
mr president , the portuguese presidency and the commission ' s strategic objectives for 2000 - 2005 both talk of full employment for which two essential conditions are required .    2.9532404788295943
the first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs .    4.175412214260519
yet the current situation in europe provides us with clear examples of how jobs are being destroyed , particularly , and most seriously , by companies which are making huge profits .    3.7282578217512015
examples have been given in spain of michelin and abb - alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for italy .    3.331406421829692
there is also another hidden way of making workers redundant , as practised for example in spain by the UNK company under the term ' externalising ' . note that sensitive words like ' redundancy ' are not used .    2.999082683073335
externalising services by UNK these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights .    3.020445777393894
this is just an UNK way of making workers redundant .    2.899210840299956
commissioner , if the european institutions really believe in what they say about full employment , they must take clear steps to secure this .    4.476411424458568
they must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations . they must revise the directive on collective redundancies , reduce the working day , link european subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the european union .    3.6327427825756553
mr president , sadly , once again , parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in europe .    3.302936952636815
yet again , workers are likely to lose their jobs .    3.5122444303240337
as has already been pointed out , in one month ' s time , 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income .    3.0278664215127575
despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the cisterna plant one of the most productive in europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle , while goodyear , after years of benefiting from state and european subsidies , is totally free to walk out .    3.628461878589392
the european commission and the council must , at last , assume all the necessary responsibilities , both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to community and national aid , which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long - term agreements to protect jobs .    4.2486003766368166
today , we ask the commission to start by protecting the workers at goodyear in cisterna , and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible , thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the cisterna plant .    3.6492771099512837
mr president , commissioner , i would also like to remind the house that there is very little time available , and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate , timely effect .    3.487306444008958
mr president , commissioner , as far as restructuring goes , there is no doubt that european companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under .    3.4600058171231756
we are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management .    3.709564135493224
although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares , this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of UNK , often shareholders , with the sole UNK aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company .    4.052874717722748
the various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers , be they by michelin or goodyear , are symptomatic in this respect .    3.2077119071166207
rationalised management and improved profits should , in my view , serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost , and any financial benefits should follow .    3.376838011894003
however , what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate UNK and relocation , with all the familiar consequences , both on the quality of products and at the social level , especially in terms of unemployment , difficult working conditions and increased flexibility : consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level , especially on the family unit .    3.8153767371196525
there is a very real risk of seeing a two - headed monster emerge on this planet , with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital .    3.0411507080736295
surely europe should act as a safeguard , maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare ?    3.3021232575177644
we must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results .    3.431027689608603
finally , allow me to remind you that the third letter of the edd group to which i belong stands for ' difference ' .    3.426027422878978
europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs . without doubt , the voice of difference in this UNK flood of restructuring .    3.294769048782546
mr president , last month in the uk , in a region that neighbours mine , the michelin group announced significant redundancies at its UNK - on - UNK plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres .    3.4667182947415873
i , like all members present , am saddened by this loss of jobs .    3.0905909475611817
equally , i am saddened by the announcement made by goodyear that has prompted this resolution .    3.462919503710444
but i doubt very much indeed whether a european works council would have been able to change this company ' s decision .    3.9499811072136772
we need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent .    2.902148239190178
in my few months here , i have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the eu , nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave .    3.8831463475022696
in our last plenary part - session in brussels we voted on the end - of - life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective , adding huge costs for the european motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted .    3.474252420349837
two days later , UNK , which UNK several thousand people in my region , stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their UNK plant .    4.354966824914273
in a world where surely less regulation is the key , we in this house seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the european union , UNK by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens .    4.4288928654660715
we meps speak often about smes and have now come up with a unique way of creating them .    3.4724673652550146
take a large successful business , add european regulations , and within months you have created a small one .    3.2506439253195967
perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here .    3.687878985191596
mr president , i will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today .    3.035920395580431
in this respect , i share mrs plooij - van gorsel ' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail .    3.1159927598420745
but maybe next time , we ought to discuss UNK , the merger which has now taken place between our UNK UNK and british steel .    4.579816238596869
i would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the european union and policy in other fields .    3.5916610280332804
in this light , i am pleased that mr liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion , where the interests of employees are concerned , with mrs diamantopoulou but we can involve the commissioners who are active in other fields .    4.2365833053324256
i would also like to advocate coherence in the commission ' s policy from these different vantage points , unlike my predecessor , who holds the belief that there is no need for rules .    3.132179211116343
we need to gain an insight into what companies are like now .    3.034407759706245
at present , we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an anglo - UNK tradition and companies with a UNK tradition .    3.742706219604181
what remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant : whether it is merely the property and UNK of shareholders , or whether it is a more broadly based UNK society , which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff , consumers , suppliers and the local population and has , in addition , a social function .    4.306117883403798
as such , i would like to ask these various commission directorates and these various commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments .    3.2463971072358424
i think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in europe , as company policy forms part of this .    3.8050593459020874
the government is talking to trade union and goodyear delegates in italy as well , in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the north american multinational in cisterna di latina , an area of central italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations .    3.8125631350001514
the closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty .    3.0931113907323247
the goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight , in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the goodyear workers in the different european countries as well , and there are many of them : france , germany , the united kingdom , poland , luxembourg and UNK .    4.228896715374807
today , a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery , anxious to find out what their future will be , what solidarity the european union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits .    3.896184146748444
the european union , in all of its aspects , must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes .    4.038152131365253
he acknowledged that 15 million europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion .    3.4654336522960034
yet , all too often these political priorities are invisible in everyday policies .    3.2385778771262426
the commission ' s decision to allow the abb - alsthom merger to go ahead is a case in point .    3.335531190814132
the new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings .    3.187318421490404
this global restructuring plan could lead to the loss of up to 12 000 jobs .    3.687303344838953
in my region of the uk in particular the employment consequences of this merger have been severe as a result of abb - alsthom having announced that it was cutting 270 jobs in britain with 95 jobs being lost in UNK and UNK in UNK .    3.7406901490444215
the company ' s failure to inform the works council about the proposals for the merger is particularly worrying .    3.4634228249545833
it is especially important in the case of large international companies where decisions are taken far from the employee .    3.4847048535422513
point 17 of the community charter of fundamental social rights of workers stresses the need for consultation , adding that this shall apply especially in companies having establishments in two or more member states .    3.552156148016696
i do not think it is simply a matter of a community charter .    3.9608549599218095
eu legislation on this issue could not be clearer .    5.191251732108324
the commission would do well in this sort of situation to make its decisions not simply on the basis of whether a merger will distort competition but also on the basis of the social and economic consequences .    3.9734563869830812
we need more joined - up policy making on these issues .    2.836921585763154
what we also need urgently is an impact assessment study on the effect of merger in every situation .    3.5626154820167923
i welcome the statement made by commissioner liikanen , but i also look for the support of this parliament to ensure that the legislation which we have passed on workers ' rights is implemented rigorously and to ensure that impact assessments on the workforce for proposed mergers are undertaken as a matter of course .    4.197439214828813
i have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .    2.120155951819166
that concludes the debate .    2.1467925807151658
the vote will be taken later this evening .    2.8280307251921712
the sitting was suspended at 3 . 50 p . m . and resumed at 4 . 05 p . m .    2.5851654283445833
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance .    1.7973816454680986
racist and xenophobic incidents in el ejido ( spain )    2.510338033606464
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :    1.9993195686368757
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr gasòliba i böhm and mr sánchez garcía , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , on racist and xenophobic incidents in el ejido ( spain ) ;    2.138458355246627
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mrs díez gonzález and others , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in el ejido ( spain ) ;    2.3806833253501654
b5 - 0169 / 2000 by mr puerta and others , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , on outbursts of xenophobia in el ejido ( spain ) ;    2.3918636085197487
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr UNK UNK and others , on behalf of the group of the greens / european free alliance , on xenophobia - related incidents in el ejido ( spain ) .    2.3831750253860227
mr president , i am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our african origin .    3.6268534218761044
i must firstly congratulate the groups in this house on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution . i am aware of the efforts made by members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes .    3.845847219268704
secondly , i must also assert my total conviction that neither spain nor andalusia is xenophobic or racist . of course this does not mean that i do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law , and by the law alone .    3.434078902200134
we should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner .    3.652116731711873
these events , which are unfortunately UNK the political decisions in this area , confirm without doubt that the development of the tampere agreements and title iv of the ec treaty must be an urgent priority .    4.40357274633935
today ' s problems cannot be solved in five years .    3.479823522821586
they will take a long time , as we are finding out .    4.476476107833303
the legislation of the member states must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in tampere , as paragraph 7 of the motion states .    4.150698817882532
legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays .    3.1690589433424345
furthermore , the labour market must be organised UNK so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages , social security and social protection in terms of equality . this will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people , which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion , and which are the real basis of the current social problem .    4.414815674762074
solidarity , dialogue and agreements between local , regional , national and european institutions and employers , unions and the immigrant communities themselves , whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility , are essential .    3.50223268682883
collaboration with the countries of origin on this issue is vital . in this respect , the action plans approved by the high level group and the tampere european council must be allocated a budget .    4.729650899750539
specifically , i must stress in this debate the plan for morocco . this is a country with which the european union has an effective relationship and common interests and which should take particular priority in mutual cooperation and collaboration .    4.667551644897868
this is a very important social debate in the creation of a european area in which the right to freedom , security and justice will be recognised in the future charter of fundamental rights .    3.7122049279543665
mr president , commissioner , whenever a serious social problem occurs , it always has a political basis . this is true of the disgraceful events which have recently occurred in el ejido .    3.1483934248974457
the proof of this lies in the fact that the groups in this house have reacted and tabled several motions for resolutions .    3.732013692720719
we all regret the deaths which have occurred and the violent and disproportionate reactions against the immigrant workers .    2.768565151073547
we all , i believe , agree in our condemnation of the xenophobia and racism which was apparent in certain actions .    3.4191842786918287
these events certainly have their origin in , among other factors , the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully .    3.0933864457649416
we hope that the events in el ejido will serve as a lesson to everyone and will not be repeated .    3.9698613508525242
yet it is not enough to regret the situation .    3.343501019755046
we do not want africa to become our cross , in fact quite the contrary .    3.851544361753828
we must therefore act .    2.653825836878512
i should like to highlight certain measures which we are trying to introduce in another european region affected by immigration - the canary islands .    3.34855683847202
firstly we are creating a network of reception centres for UNK .    3.270856351149451
secondly we are conducting a programme of social integration .    3.8579879347979555
thirdly we are carrying out education programmes on tolerance and respect .    3.225424914156459
finally we are producing a census of immigrants .    2.9784848323482374
i hope that these measures will help towards ensuring compliance with the tampere agreements on immigration and the new spanish act on aliens . in particular they must ensure that people arriving in europe do not lose their dignity .    3.4625004398561403
mr president , last week , in the andalusian town of el ejido , we saw scenes which were inappropriate to the european union in the year 2000 .    3.548566612206651
this was acknowledged by the commission president , romano prodi , on 9 february when he confirmed that what had occurred in el ejido went against the very principles of the european union .    3.622753978916295
these events have caused us great pain and shame and have awoken our fears given the extreme racism , xenophobia and intolerance demonstrated .    2.8248290745412867
it is incomprehensible that ways of UNK and ensuring mutual respect cannot be found between two communities which are mutually beneficial .    3.3833778132714567
the only way to prevent these events happening again , in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers , is through social integration . this requires a firm economic , political and social commitment from the competent authorities .    3.68270187562212
we are all immigrants .    2.8134010493292956
for generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly UNK .    3.1924006498961144
geographical mobility is not an UNK of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work - related causes .    4.448276859601512
we are all immigrants , if not ourselves personally , then through one of our relations or UNK .    3.533249237534573
however , instead of producing these events which we are condemning , migration must generate social , cultural and economic enrichment .    3.5716591407147837
what happened in el ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the european union .    3.142364849558823
we must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of el ejido against immigrant workers in the area . a whole community should not have been held responsible , UNK and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident .    3.387870344358424
secondly , all the authorities must act immediately . coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism .    3.9234565992186394
in particular , local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia , especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property .    3.4864314809965644
these authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these , as has happened with the mayor in question .    3.8064375384871947
thirdly , the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials . they must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the european union .    3.337985658078006
finally , the european union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles .    4.171565745965382
it must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and UNK with national , regional and local authorities and non - governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles . this must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the eu .    3.575201247907794
mr president , initially our group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon .    3.694145400096374
however , the incidents in el ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout europe and which deserves our full attention .    2.9992200430601845
we thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in europe . yet , over the years , social disintegration in europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance .    3.519724579253609
this house therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures UNK all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately . we must ensure respect for human rights , tolerance and UNK and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues .    4.580198928052592
in this respect we must not forget that the original victim ' s UNK was suffering from a mental illness for which he had been inadequately treated .    3.0472250865262267
finally , as our nobel prize winner , josé saramago , has said , we are all in each other and as UNK UNK said , although saramago disagreed with this , we should not just love one another , more importantly , we should respect one another .    3.947608550488204
mr president , commissioner , andalusia is one of the most tolerant and UNK regions of the european union .    2.8722716504088086
since time UNK it has welcomed all those who have decided to move there and regarded them as andalusians from day one , whether or not they were born in our region . therefore , as an mep , but primarily as an andalusian , i can feel only UNK , UNK and condemnation for the xenophobic and racist events which have occurred and which are foreign to this tolerant community .    3.631164240742286
yet a worrying situation is apparent .    3.0887285995366534
all decisions which are or are not taken and all agreements which are or are not negotiated by the community institutions with regard to the economy of the principal sectors in disadvantaged areas like andalusia may indirectly lead to these serious incidents . i am referring , for example , to the lack of agreement with morocco and to the lack of solutions for the fishing industry , part of whose fleet is UNK in almería .    4.119190518986705
i am also referring to the erratic management of the import scheme for fruit and UNK by the eu which is UNK relations between almería and morocco . i am also referring to the immigration policy of the regions , member states and european union which , due to actions or omissions , is leading to a few territories like almería having to support this migratory pressure from north - west africa on their own .    3.8668253461890263
all these factors have unfortunately been UNK over time and are now allowing those who are cruel , UNK , racist and destructive , of which all our countries have some examples , but UNK a minority , to light the UNK of xenophobia .    4.4779592989301
anyone , whether european or not , who lives and works in andalusia , is an andalusian and deserves our consideration and respect . the eu can and must speak out .    3.7971135814014807
for you , the south is andalusia but for us andalusians it is africa .    3.656027087840533
we must therefore ensure that the eu provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another . this has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way .    3.8817358356684424
mr president , commissioner , i speak from experience acquired during many visits to el ejido over the years . i was therefore aware how the situation was developing .    2.959835127298419
here in the european parliament , as in many other institutions , we have UNK this situation with concern and were beside ourselves when we heard what had happened . this is because we felt the problem to be ours , as it was .    4.563651801324138
in el ejido there is a serious social problem , problems of integration and employment and also a grave problem of public safety which acted as the UNK .    4.353086409782524
these events have also acted as a wake - up call to our consciences .    2.659898108738057
here in this house , in spain and in many other countries , we have all fixed on el ejido . yet what we do and say here and the concern we express will really serve no purpose unless this leads to the adoption of a much more determined attitude to finding out what is really happening , not only in el ejido , but in many other places where this type of problem may be occurring at any given moment .    4.010560049743321
we all agree in our condemnation of intolerance and we also agree that we must look forward . we will not find the guilty parties in this house or in many other places .    4.249205364343347
those responsible for what happened in el ejido are a minority who set out to satisfy their desire for vengeance on the immigrants . we must bear in mind that vengeance is not a solution .    3.7329894201032094
these problems can only be solved by close cooperation between all the authorities in order to achieve social integration and respect for all working there . this therefore requires a determined fight against illegal immigration and profound respect for the rights of immigrant workers who are legally working in el ejido and throughout europe .    3.7985050162142353
mr president , this resolution expresses solidarity with the democratic forces in spain fighting for human rights .    3.0851102223402256
all the spanish democrats wounded by what is happening in their country have our full and complete support .    3.6219410636705143
it was not only immigrants who were the victims of atrocities ; the democratic system in spain has been held up to UNK , despite having demonstrated its tremendous capacity to evolve over the last 20 years .    3.5026756962070684
employers would be lost without immigrants .    3.7976078072772586
working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no spaniard will accept them .    3.463240951447585
low wages , the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard UNK - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are UNK and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves .    3.9114099610394
what happened at el ejido is the result of inadmissible racist and xenophobic practices in europe today .    3.5062697038506725
for four days , the immigrants were collectively UNK .    3.389421339696252
women and children were UNK .    3.6320020770253927
fleeing from all quarters , hundreds of immigrants took refuge on a UNK on the UNK of the town .    4.201321269086884
we are right to UNK haider ' s austria ; but we cannot allow little local UNK to practice policies of racial exclusion and UNK economic UNK .    3.449092432734296
what happened in spain could happen in any country in the union if we are not careful .    4.068909291946572
we all have a duty to put our own house in order .    2.8053533158913635
i support this proposal for a resolution , especially the points which refer to the application of article 13 of the amsterdam treaty , and point 11 of this resolution establishing a link between the structural funds allocated and the fight against exclusion .    4.126918469677913
it would be to our credit were the european parliament to roundly condemn these events and support all proposals tabled in order to ensure that the rights of immigrants in spain and throughout the union are respected .    4.116522214742752
mr president , acts of racist and xenophobic violence are taking hold at the heart of europe .    2.8935427418144597
everywhere this violence is exacerbated by the spread of extremist movements .    3.2232084796958835
we must take practical steps today to put an end to all attacks of a physical nature .    3.0658688562262433
no european society can truly flourish when it harbours the risk of seeing one section of its population fall prey to the hatred of the other .    3.312884389996083
having received a delegation from the austrian human rights association here yesterday and having seen what has happened in the province of almería , it is easy to understand that we could easily have prevented this resurgence of racist hatred .    3.4760969041152956
these violent scenes at el ejido are so similar to UNK pictures of UNK in the UNK , when the UNK UNK the black population , that it is hard to tell them apart . they also put us in mind of germany in the 1930s , when the nazis were persecuting the jews .    4.105887454262324
without wishing to lump everything together UNK , because each period is different , we have failed to learn the lessons of history .    3.6744716242110305
that is my conclusion today .    2.925076874920536
because this UNK hunt which broke out in the province of almería should have been foreseen .    3.5177557309633105
it is the result , first and foremost , of the UNK and exploitation of immigrant labour .    4.118756833580081
three annual crops of moroccan and african workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly eur 2 million ; and yet 60 % of them have no running water in a region where , as we know , the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer .    3.3065465619644177
we also know that many of them only earn eur 30 a month , while their fellow european citizens can earn three times that .    3.3403069985687304
this precarious wage - UNK position weakens these immigrants and their families and makes them vulnerable .    3.1927737387998607
the irresponsibility of certain elected representatives and the barely disguised complicity of the authorities have contributed to this racist explosion .    3.3715011660529424
we should counter such acts of terror , mr president , by setting up a parliamentary committee of inquiry as quickly as possible so that we can decide how we can succeed in preventing other conflicts of a similar nature elsewhere . my fellow member , mrs UNK , was right to remind us just now that we all need to put our own house in order .    3.751222513803171
finally , and i think this is important : why not have the honesty today to relay what was UNK in a recent un study explaining that , if spain wishes to preserve its work , retirement and pension potential , it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status ; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year UNK ?    3.8546858878782175
we must insist today as a matter of urgency on the right to education and the duty to remember , to recall the dates in history when our countries UNK on the brink of horror .    3.573903975518558
we need to educate our children on these matters and finally have the courage to recognise that we will need to be prepared to accept many more immigrants in years to come .    3.8320717059391285
it just remains for me to urge you all to attend the demonstration on saturday .    3.550502053206
mr president , since the signature of the treaty of amsterdam , the european union has had responsibility for combating racism and xenophobia .    3.4713817625725567
two types of measure are required for this purpose . the first should seek the integration of people of non - european origin and the other should aim to organise immigration .    4.028836404701555
with regard to the first , the commission has sent us a series of proposals , contained in two directives and an action plan , which aim to apply the following decision taken by the heads of state and government in tampere . this states that ' the european union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its member states .    3.792038946999892
a more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of eu citizens ' . this is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in el ejido where there are irregularities , labour exploitation and indecent living conditions , which have been condemned in the past .    4.028695834803237
i hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration . i also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in tampere , including spain , will work diligently to apply these .    3.7182990349134926
i have less hope about the development of an effective and fair european policy in accordance with the statement made by the council on immigration .    4.407524559540689
the only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification . this is a key issue , as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in el ejido .    4.770708533638291
yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments . outside the community arena , some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies .    3.6267656500762935
this is occurring in my country , despite the government , the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens .    4.259274262205589
the objective of combating racism and xenophobia , explained in the treaties , should be the objective of all european institutions and politicians .    4.579552209869478
on 28 february 1998 the european political parties , including the spanish popular party , signed the charter of european political parties for a non - racist society .    3.751902004010631
this requires coherent behaviour , yet local leaders of the popular party are throwing more fuel on the UNK fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out .    3.191956396405667
the party to which the mayor of el ejido belongs should , according to the commitments signed in this charter , act forcefully .    3.680524310205203
it is only , as stated by mr UNK mollar , through unity , responsibility and UNK that el ejido , spain and europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed .    3.902577921267204
mr president , one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of UNK , no less , of moroccan day UNK which took place in el ejido .    3.150080420383709
we do not the extent to which far - right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame .    2.900545196020626
we wish to assure these moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough , they have to suffer this type of aggression .    3.8420935561514065
in waging war against people who are as poor as they are , they are only doing their own UNK a favour and preparing a future of oppression for themselves .    3.7524647199904106
but there are some who bear even more responsibility than the UNK who UNK the iron UNK and UNK : those who spread racist and xenophobic slander , those who indulge in anti - immigration demagoguery in spain , austria , france or elsewhere , sometimes even here in this house , are no better than those who take this stupid , UNK demagoguery at face value .    3.4838800467943187
the UNK UNK and their extreme right - wing UNK are the mortal enemies not only of the workers , but of society as a whole .    3.876111778051452
. i would like to begin by congratulating the honourable member on the way in which he introduced this extremely important debate .    3.702142131255029
i want to make it clear at the outset that the commission unreservedly condemns the dreadful acts of violence at el ejido against the immigrant workers of the region .    3.5065641980028315
we express our support for the families and friends of the victims .    4.29114628017985
president prodi and commissioner diamantopoulou have both issued separate statements .    2.8608156697093214
naturally i completely endorse what they have said .    3.437645851438383
it was especially moving to hear the remarks from members of parliament who come from the region about what has happened , UNK , in a part of spain that i know reasonably well .    4.25954469394579
racist and xenophobic acts are wholly unacceptable within our community , wherever they take place .    3.1754043865890846
they fly in the face of the very principles on which - as mr havel said yesterday - the european union was founded : principles of liberty , democracy and respect for human rights .    3.3271026340173253
of course progress has been made in recent years but we still have to work together towards a climate of tolerance in which racism and xenophobia are regarded as completely beyond the UNK , completely unacceptable , while at the same time we deal very UNK with incidents such as the ones we are discussing this afternoon .    3.7521200621187796
we need , in our judgement , to focus on a package of measures including : first , the introduction of effective , anti - discrimination legislation at union level ; second , implementation of a common immigration policy with regard to the nationals of non - member states to promote , in practical terms , the integration of the immigrant population in member states ' societies ; third , the introduction of measures to combat social exclusion .    4.059776425710574
the european union has already laid the basis for community legislation on combating discrimination on the grounds of race .    3.225811327565416
the insertion of article 13 , which was referred to during the debate , dealing with non - discrimination in the treaty establishing the european community , is one of the most significant changes of the last revision of the treaties .    3.9633691525426076
since the treaty of amsterdam came into force the commission has presented a package of proposals for the implementation of article 13 including , in particular , a proposal for a directive on the application of the principle of equal treatment regardless of race or ethnic origin .    3.517729556025504
this proposal is under examination by the council and the european parliament .    3.5482575850940465
the commission hopes very much that this stage will soon be complete .    3.291823262492186
the conclusions of the tampere special european council , as mr UNK mollar said , clearly illustrated the will of the heads of state and government as regards the introduction of a common policy on immigration and the principles on which it should be based , with particular emphasis on the union ' s policy on the respect and promotion of the rights of migrants .    4.0707633199771305
at tampere the heads of state and government also emphasised the importance of approximating national legislation on conditions for admission and residence of third country nationals based on a shared assessment of the economic and demographic developments in the member states as well as the situation in the countries of origin .    3.9873982534565235
the european council also considered it important to step up the prevention of illegal immigration .    3.293195070447851
the word that is used about them in chinese society is ' snake - heads ' . it seems to me a fitting description of them .    3.1350315576648193
let me also draw attention to the work on drawing up a european union charter on fundamental rights , which has now reached the drafting stage .    4.11760820806181
those rights are , by definition , universal .    3.738978557267741
the charter will extend to third country nationals in member states even though certain rights will be reserved to nationals of member states of the union .    3.4689673200947015
the el ejido incidents were shocking , as several members have said in their speeches .    3.210451471765147
but trying to take something positive from them , i hope they will spur us on to translate our aspirations about tolerance , fairness and freedom into real and effective policies that will help to transform the lives of all those families and individuals in the european union who cry out for our understanding and our help and who deserve it , not at some indefinite moment in the future , but here today .    3.685237953276388
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the joint debate is closed .    2.6217336641448776
the vote will take place at 6 p . m .    1.979848588558389
human rights    4.004098851144275
mr president , before we start the debate on kosovo or mitrovica , i must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me .    3.2153744746441055
indeed , it is not the first time that we will be debating kosovo here .    3.6875379609924415
we have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot , as nothing is actually done with them .    3.4534343813866903
i very much appreciate it that the commission always UNK .    3.9299484219813308
i certainly appreciate the fact that commissioner patten is present , given his powers .    3.3688567959052396
but i - and many members with me - also have to note that the council is consistently absent from this debate .    4.049572265761941
we need to cooperate with the council too .    3.7457625113530884
i see that a UNK from the council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the council but , for the rest , nothing will get done .    4.630306303440409
i would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the council should be present during the topical debate , so that we can enter into direct consultation with the council .    3.7316926240143564
i think we should give this some thought .    3.1034481343468756
i would request you to pass this complaint on to the bureau of parliament .    3.3371186315566113
mr president , commissioner , we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons .    2.9313165538583115
first , because mr sakellariou , who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom i shall not quote , vehemently UNK it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender .    3.3776294526864494
i have no doubt , and i am sure that you have no doubt , that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance .    3.9448860680967974
the other reason is that this text does not , unfortunately , go very far .    4.249682881229984
i think that it manages , through a series of clever UNK , to carefully avoid addressing the central issue , i . e . the final status of kosovo .    3.320912712786614
i doubt that any of you still believe that kosovo can one day become part of yugoslavia .    3.3287198973529524
i also doubt that any of you can believe that milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of kosovo .    2.758889704568798
i also doubt that any of you think that , as things stand , it is not in milosevic ' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise kosovo , as he is doing and as we have seen .    4.036411189867068
finally , i do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to kosovo .    3.416244265184871
i also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution , which you no doubt overlooked .    3.360049308702566
you condemn the first direct attack on the kfor troops .    3.231381246530587
i would not want you to be birds of ill omen , but i fear that , by failing to confront the real issue , you will end up being just that and i shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen .    3.99784454088308
on the contrary , i think it is our duty to call on the commission and the council , which unfortunately is not present , to insist that the united nations consider the question of the final status of kosovo , of the multiplicity of micro - states in the region , of what happens post - dayton and , finally , the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the european union a policy in this region .    4.228386640694492
finally , i would stress that we have been asking the council and the commission since july to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 kosovar prisoners and mrs brovina , mr UNK and mr UNK .    3.8732836729426134
why not ?    2.953813619373112
mr president , what is happening in mitrovica in kosovo is appalling and reprehensible .    3.1539139847599946
violence begets violence , and revenge begets revenge .    3.329792772615061
the police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on .    4.164078241993294
the chief commissioner of police , UNK UNK , has expressed his UNK at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed .    3.7887953521578113
he has fewer than 2 000 officers , and it was agreed that there should be nearly 5 000 .    3.9279530236905935
the police force should be large enough for it to be a visible presence , so that people can believe that it is in a position to stop atrocities . it should also be large enough to be able to clear up crimes and punish those who are guilty of them .    4.237348651802992
otherwise , there is a danger of people taking the law into their own hands . it is therefore also important that local officers should be trained , and the idea was , in fact , that 2 000 to 3 000 officers should be trained .    3.623560569572747
however , there are still fewer than 200 trained police officers to contribute to clearing up crime . a year ago , we did of course see what happens when agreements and resolutions which have been made are not followed up .    3.362293268986196
i was in kosovo on 27 october 1998 when the serbs withdrew .    2.9509291837304925
the agreement was that 1 800 osce observers should arrive to guarantee the peace .    3.307385267341313
after a month , however , there was still only a handful of observers .    4.679337688328934
by christmas , there were perhaps 100 and , by the spring , still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was , in fact , in place .    3.6735788817821806
atrocities were not even being recorded .    3.878695517773119
then the war came , and the observers were withdrawn .    4.085391842950672
i would therefore ask the commissioner : can you not in fact do anything to stop us repeating our UNK here in europe ?    3.6688285269237526
can you not guarantee increasing the police presence to 5 000 officers and training local officers , who would naturally find it easier to clear up crimes than would officers from abroad ?    2.930707359549519
i might also ask : when do you anticipate that they will be in place ?    3.92554280237632
and when is more responsibility to be transferred to local democratic authorities ?    3.3413979794061777
i mention this last issue because it is the solution we should be embracing as quickly as possible if peace is to have any chance at all .    4.034572979386158
all who are in contact with real life in kosovo share the same opinion : it is a tragic , desperate situation where there is a democratic UNK and no possibility of the different ethnic groups living peacefully side by side . mitrovica is a tragic example of this .    3.9283540840618323
before military intervention by nato , milosevic ' s policy for kosovo was certainly to be condemned , and the demands of the non - violent forces of the UNK era for the kosovar regions to be autonomous were justified .    4.3966052115630605
but nato ' s decision for military intervention and the kla ' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced kosovo to a UNK , as well as destroying civil infrastructures in serbia .    4.0570207113167704
today , kosovo has no adequate strategy for protecting minority groups , and these include not only serbs and roma , but also moderate albanians who still believe in the possibility of peaceful coexistence and are persecuted by the extremists in power .    3.608506283686917
it is useless to talk of the roma houses which have been burnt down and the thousands upon thousands of new refugees and the refugees from UNK , who are now living , UNK in , in kosovo , abandoned by the UNK , which itself has been abandoned by the donors , while the emergency is still of dramatic proportions .    4.097979738409272
in the joint resolution , we ask the council and the member states to double their efforts to ensure respect for minority groups and to work towards the creation of democratic structures , giving a voice to all those forces which still believe in peaceful coexistence .    3.930528568550965
in this sense , i am in agreement with mr sakellariou ' s proposals .    3.597812534670144
another subject being discussed is the release of the albanians held in prisons , particularly flora brovina , a woman of extraordinary humanity whom i met , together with the women in black of belgrade , during joint attempts to build bridges between women from different ethnic groups .    2.9997129397365425
flora defended herself , and asked serbs and albanians to shake hands .    3.0907728882476766
flora brovina ' s UNK is the guest of serbian women in belgrade .    3.7241961393532694
this is a sign of hope , the hope that it possible to act differently even in serbia .    3.976132168212093
it is not true that flora brovina has been abandoned .    2.928167066546033
she might well have been abandoned by the large institutions , but we , who worked in kosovo and serbia for many years , are doing our utmost to campaign for her release .    3.877370957971619
i believe that the european union must do likewise .    3.252773970024154
the embargo on serbia must be lifted and serbia must , in turn , release its political prisoners .    3.268954115018038
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to fully endorse mrs pack ' s very UNK - charged contribution .    2.6933730889411502
what she has said here is completely justified .    3.501757139132066
there is not one truth in kosovo , there are several .    4.047567218290565
i refuse to accept that we can now talk about a genocide in reverse - that is UNK the truth .    4.452054093894723
i completely concur with the draft resolution which is before us .    3.2596117529431474
we condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do , but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse .    4.477369291255771
needless to say , the situation in mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why .    3.750074369888517
there are also important economic interests at stake and the whole tragedy surrounding the UNK mines also plays its part .    3.16512245969787
we have already talked about the fate of the political prisoners .    3.5695727092267964
there is a great deal of pain , a lot of suffering in kosovo .    3.325214646736701
the people are holding demonstrations , they are sending us e - UNK .    3.7783030844371277
they ask us where their children are , their sons .    3.275222655634188
we need to be able to go back with a proper answer .    3.2455923340178106
the case of flora brovina is just one of many .    3.705605617570081
we are right to include this in the draft resolution , but there are hundreds , even thousands of flora UNK out there .    3.8813929115468193
i would ask the commission and the absent council at long last to do something for these political prisoners .    3.8624798033747756
the fact that they are locked up in serbia also fuels the UNK and violence in kosovo .    4.047745108568562
mr president , in the present joint draft resolution , paragraph 10 urges the council and member states - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the un police units .    4.048793734717533
this request is fully in line with the vision held by the special representative of the un in kosovo , mr bernard kouchner .    3.5849729388101954
in order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in kosovo , he needs , by his own UNK , at least 6 000 foreign police officers .    3.795793670103323
the un , however , have pledged to UNK a police force of 4 800 .    3.994554911363866
to date , however , mr kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal .    3.61699889689917
moreover , half of this group is from the united states and germany .    3.80687678315321
it is logical that the special representative of the un in kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation , especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region .    3.433683215909872
what is UNK , however , is mr kouchner ' s sharp criticism levelled at the french government these days .    3.8964884178971877
paris is leaving its fellow - countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen , not more than 37 , in the crisis region .    3.7410756255646906
for this hardly honourable position , mr kouchner UNK none other than the minister for home affairs , mr chevènement .    3.6261946791466686
according to mr kouchner , the minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the french police officials on ideological grounds .    3.8190148810887696
i would ask the council and the commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the european parliament of the outcome .    3.7655396153756358
press freedom in angola    5.082749764844364
mr president , i do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity .    2.9930869772128315
on the question of angola , i think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last .    4.246548993022329
it would be the first in a long time .    3.256285898977523
so i welcome it as such .    3.4037365406134885
i think that the european union and the western world in general has had mr savimbi in their UNK for some time now , with no discrimination whatsoever , but corruption is now so rife in mr dos santos ' s regime that even his long - standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything .    3.126707692061942
so i think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter , especially the worrying things which we are discussing , particularly logistics support for the information services by the united states and great britain , generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely ' UNK ' matters which we need to go into .    4.142383243330462
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the european parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the european union .    3.0978964024814872
clearly , governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial , geostrategic or economic interests .    3.2576952053483996
we have established requirements for the countries which want to join our union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support , because we believe in democracy and its values .    4.023572999100414
a free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy .    2.9921993431944736
there can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion .    2.8942651142718905
yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted , UNK , threatened or put under pressure .    3.148430633145093
we rightfully condemned the behaviour of unita which threatened the peace process in angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace . rightfully and with the full weight of our authority , we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the government of angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society .    3.6343502840820587
mr president , how much longer can we continue our cooperation with angola ?    3.1356710898422984
human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time , not only by unita , but also by the government itself .    3.951470105025631
the legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle .    3.1428486703947134
the angolan government must immediately authorise a substantial un presence which can mediate and can report on human rights .    3.055730398396793
additionally , european observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists .    3.548793102410772
europe , as a major donor , has so far remained too passive with regard to angola .    4.4499709613401555
if the angolan government continues to refuse to cooperate , measures will need to be taken .    3.55047859253539
without national reconciliation , reconciliation with europe is not possible .    3.7569632005292135
this being the case , angola will unfortunately remain a very UNK diamond .    3.150331135876686
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this house . the repression of both angolan and foreign journalists in angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment .    2.9852554044604576
however , this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them .    3.183241151979879
yet this is not the situation .    4.73649329416387
angola does not enjoy rule of law . it is a repressive dictatorship .    4.595682241348693
it is at war , and a bloody war at that , which is dragging on and on .    4.536555630995254
the prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept .    3.7750015127670005
the repeated appeals made by the angolan church and , for example , by mr UNK and mr UNK , for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this house .    3.838490203554266
as another member said , we must have a general debate on angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country .    4.0245755404207175
for example , i have today received information directly from UNK UNK , whose situation we are discussing , according to which two UNK from portuguese television have been imprisoned in angola .    3.7081434826401405
these cases keep occurring .    3.405409516869561
yet the worst part is that there is no way out of the situation in angola .    3.999222400635214
the silence of the major powers and our own silence are questionable and are benefiting a regime of corruption , violence and war .    3.3272934592697654
i must draw attention to the fact that the war in angola is spreading to other parts of africa .    3.8085604903693624
it is impacting on the war in the democratic republic of the congo and on the situations in namibia and zambia . it is now also affecting the situation in zimbabwe where robert UNK has just lost the referendum precisely because he has sent troops to the congo to UNK up UNK UNK who is beyond salvation .    3.460179750170496
there are two sides in angola or rather two armed groups .    2.905351556275247
the first is the mpla , which controls the oil profits . the second is the armed UNK of mr savimbi , which controls the diamond profits .    2.8004431774862684
it is oil and UNK which are financing the continuation of the war which , as has been said , is terrible . it has displaced millions of people and caused them to go UNK .    4.113471965241929
it has led to a critical and tragic situation in angola .    2.9032887555048474
this war must be stopped .    3.518764783501115
the authority of this house could play an important part if we were to have a major debate on the angolan situation and also on the whole of southern africa .    5.440472448390957
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the motion for a resolution before us today is important because of its subject and the desire to protect the rule of law and press freedom . it is also very important because of the broad consensus which has finally been reached after some heated discussions behind the scenes .    3.530617476439244
the problem considered by the motion is a major one but , as has already been touched upon , could be regarded as minor in light of the even greater problem of the general situation in angola which is experiencing a terrible humanitarian disaster .    4.151770440634484
this situation , as in neighbouring former UNK , is like a UNK wound in which it is not clear who is UNK whom . as mr soares just said , a truly terrible situation is developing in angola and in other countries in the region .    4.086793268095713
this was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the first world war of africa , given the involvement of certain countries in others .    3.8816360572849824
this is a major issue because the angolan state and authorities must assume their responsibilities . the international community and the european union must spell this out very clearly .    3.666874660414383
these journalists are professionals who are trying to inform the public in their country and denounce the corruption existing in this regime , for which they are being persecuted .    4.057428980283832
it is clear that such a scenario will never allow peace to be established in angola .    3.078313575492756
we have experienced this in our own national and european history . people can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant .    3.700525871001704
the cause of these journalists is therefore one which we must embrace , although bearing in mind that the problem goes much wider and much deeper and is much more terrible .    3.6721691088818966
like a previous speaker , i also fully support the appeals which have been made .    4.106871926033924
we must , some time soon , find the courage to tackle the whole angolan problem more broadly and more vigorously .    3.3148274448584036
in recent years , the behaviour of unita has UNK our reservations and criticisms but this cannot be used to excuse the angolan state for having established a disastrous war economy with widespread corruption resulting in the continued suffering of its people .    3.11433092306251
we must establish dialogue with other forces in angola , be attentive to the appeals of the angolan church and encourage the emergence of other national institutions , national reconciliation and new cultural and political forces not engaged in war . these can then eventually free this country and this people from the armed fate which they have been experiencing for decades .    3.0464781775310015
the people of angola deserve better .    3.6215399334131737
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , it seems as if the world is turned upside down .    2.7320806203541914
journalists are sent to prison for simply speaking the truth , whilst soldiers who are supposedly fighting each other exchange smuggled goods in the bar in the evening .    3.046686056601599
this is angola ' s reality .    2.9154271434264003
we are now expressing our horror concerning this war .    2.852758748597802
three million victims , two million driven from their homes within the country ' s borders , hundreds of thousands driven away across its borders , including women and children .    3.278446537420132
this is a war which transcends its borders . it is not just unita which is to blame .    3.979148433766742
the government too is responsible for this continuing violence . this is why we insist that the journalists - more than 20 were imprisoned last year - keep speaking their minds .    3.618077042987741
we want the un embargo , which is supposed to prevent a large proportion of arms and ammunition from being UNK across to unita airports , to stop .    3.794797570026759
but what do these sanctions mean ?    3.2166304453611447
it is the western world itself which is partly to blame .    3.154925246887859
it is we , our own people , who keep the war going over there .    3.7036181827248873
the so - called civilised world should UNK its head in shame .    3.2540732441861233
this is also the case for the so - called statutory government which is just as guilty , because if this journalist has accused the president himself of deriving benefit from this civil war , then all he is doing is UNK what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across africa .    3.313923093183572
mr president , we are partly to blame for this war .    2.9062543492271096
we should stop financing this regime and we should certainly stop supplying arms for the war .    3.4372062150316274
mr president , the facts are well - known .    3.0489443890824104
on 24 december , the angolan court sentenced a correspondent of the portuguese paper , UNK , to a year ' s imprisonment and a fine of usd 20 000 .    4.116425357942084
the journalist had brought to light a corruption scandal in the president ' s cabinet .    3.105234340203005
the trial took place behind closed doors and the defendant was only allowed one witness .    2.990552080891496
another journalist was threatened with his life during a parliamentary debate last month by a member of parliament of the mpla government party .    3.6030767693657104
these are only two examples of a trend in angola to silence any government critics .    3.0154989121281086
over the past year , more than twenty journalists have been arrested for alleged slander or criminal offences against state security .    3.144734322918448
their only crime was to criticise what human rights organisations have been denouncing all along , namely the large - scale corruption and disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars , paid by the oil companies to the angolan government .    3.317993985918529
even the british minister , peter UNK , conceded this recently . we should ensure that the oil revenue is not used merely to finance the war or to line the pockets of prominent members of government , he told president dos santos last month .    3.2096921237722293
but , at the same time , we note that great britain and also portugal are continuing to channel military aid to the government .    3.129934268649909
there is indeed a great deal of hypocrisy regarding angola .    3.2890333070764677
on the basis of a report , the human rights organisation global witness concluded that the western world is turning a blind eye to the activities of dos santos because it is fishing for lucrative oil contracts .    3.4322060336634173
i would like to challenge portugal to deliver proof to the contrary , by making commercial interests UNK to human rights , to which so much lip service is being paid .    3.8131992203034133
in my opinion , angola is a test case .    2.8628825579207717
we should , at any rate , judge the portuguese presidency on its actions and not on its words .    3.5982293555394467
native americans in the us - dineh    4.471462443854977
mr president , the american leaders do not seem to have learnt a great deal from the criticism of how they treated the indians and other indigenous peoples .    3.2198568102855307
we have to admit that our european sense of responsibility is no more developed in this respect .    3.630255542068858
once again , an indigenous people ' s right of existence is being threatened .    3.45598705680014
once again , the individuality , dignity and health of a people are being sacrificed to the higher economic interest .    2.999855277733205
once again , we are losing a piece of our planet ' s cultural and ecological heritage , despite the many treaties and resolutions on human rights , on the protection of minorities , rights of indigenous peoples , etc . , which have already been ratified .    4.357181357998744
if tradition and culture have to make way for economic imperatives at all , we should at least give sufficient attention to the reception and reintegration of the peoples concerned .    4.145075878826215
but if we are to believe the environmental movements , even this is vain hope .    3.231465938257188
there are hardly any reintegration programmes for people who have been UNK to the so - called new lands .    4.195815685837057
it very much remains to be seen whether these new lands will be safe in terms of public health .    3.331934174609275
it is of key importance that the american authorities provide greater clarity regarding the way in which they are trying to offer these families a UNK alternative in keeping with a traditional way of life .    3.16428602657728
it is also important that a debate is held where the long - term effects of mining in this region are discussed and UNK up in economic , ecological and social terms .    3.3699150984807904
the credibility of the industrialised north is at stake .    2.8177159970255485
indeed , what right do we have to demand of developing countries that they give their minorities a voice , that they protect their valuable natural areas and that they respect human rights , if it UNK that we are unable to meet these demands in our own countries ?    4.735188235128507
mr president , as mr van hecke rightly pointed out , this is about human rights and about the rights of indigenous peoples , and parliament must speak up , especially vis - à - vis good friends , and the united states is a good friend .    4.663413591688678
this is about the repression of a minority which unfortunately goes back a long time .    3.217391696688862
it is up to the european parliament to protect vulnerable people .    3.5912186363517264
so we need to do this .    3.688005531170497
this is also about respecting a culture , a language , a way of life and a people ' s religion , a vulnerable culture which has nearly disappeared .    3.5883722070014548
it is important to point this out .    2.8486532858065257
this is why it is necessary - and mr van hecke has already mentioned this , and this is also what we clearly ask for in our resolution - that the role of mining in this vulnerable desert area is UNK .    3.8299527805087377
we have just approved the water directive here in parliament .    3.172876655120237
the water which these people need to exist is under threat because the groundwater strata there are being UNK by a mining company , and this is why the traditional way of life of the people who live there is being threatened .    3.586892654560681
the forced relocation scheme must be stopped unconditionally .    3.405959704290649
people should no longer be forced to move .    3.56844184280283
over the past 25 years , no less than 25 000 people have been forced to move and this must stop .    3.8449169456067334
if people need to move at all , they need to be given a viable alternative .    4.177402378285811
this is not the case here .    2.848083376963046
the area where the people in question are now being taken - and this is also the reason for this resolution - is a polluted area which is economically not suitable .    4.351284103654703
this is why i think that we as european parliament need to ask the american authorities in any case to suspend the relocation scheme under discussion and , if necessary , abandon the scheme altogether .    3.6414031193142953
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , this is my maiden speech and i am delivering it with a great deal of pleasure and conviction as the topic is human rights .    3.281236252794691
we need to continue to stand up for these rights , especially in our own member states and societies , but also elsewhere .    4.593080391492233
as mr UNK said , we certainly need to do this vis - à - vis the united states which , after all , is close to us in terms of democratic values .    4.364535992000392
the treatment of the native americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights .    3.479034233310468
the account of the dineh indians is telling .    4.077526065122423
with the discovery and , certainly , the exploitation of black gold - and , later on , uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty , hardship and contamination .    3.1665793904456048
the area in UNK which is to be the new land for the dineh indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in us history .    3.7548466532072173
it is now the intention to send the last 4 000 dineh indians to this land .    3.075083067886879
the fight of these indians is being backed by more than 250 ngos and , thanks to the efforts of the belgian ' mother earth ' organisation , we are being kept informed of this situation .    3.610580876804084
this too is characteristic of american society , which hears little about it .    2.8979357226691462
they get UNK up about wars and genocide on other UNK , but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country .    3.573661478563326
today , the dineh indians are facing their final fight for their right to land , for their right to dignity and , above all , for their right to their way of life .    3.273575518137663
there are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful , economic UNK .    3.387296755135568
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers , but i would like to emphasise a few things .    3.6007026058489155
the dineh people belong to the north - american navajo indians .    3.417824090358322
they are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years .    2.9735796061240425
they have been living in harrowing living conditions for years .    3.0120150117903375
the deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries .    3.5956355969028206
the relocation act , which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re - distribute the land of the navajo reservation , authorised the relocation of the peoples .    3.3875774427686
this relocation is , of course , unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic , social and cultural terms .    3.286437120827301
the dineh indians are being moved like pawns and , in that way , lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their UNK - but also any prospect of work and sources of income .    3.7021119981374344
congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives .    4.272845725366941
the population was not allowed any input .    3.375495145962306
this resembles a kind of trade in human beings .    3.877512092262689
the relocation scheme was implemented and the dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium .    3.1145707141229235
after the collapse of the dam in new mexico in 1979 , which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium , this place is one of the world ' s most contaminated areas .    2.9354565685066465
it is high time we respected the rights of the indians .    3.132981830301171
this is why we ask you to vote for this resolution : we in europe should not be UNK by american interests which are being pushed by financial , religious and industrial groups .    3.6327664254808334
so let us contact the united states now !    3.8792228845191064
madam president , despite the protests by the international press , we still do not know the fate of mr andrey babitsky , the courageous russian journalist who has worked intensively to ensure free and independent information on the ordeal of the civilian population of chechnya and the destruction of the city of grozny .    3.1499664880161715
among the contradictions in the accounts that have been given , there has also been an attempt to reassure international public opinion over mr babitsky ' s fate , by confirming the theory that there was an exchange of prisoners with chechen fighters which , inter alia , if this did actually take place , would constitute a breach of international law , which certainly does not provide for the involvement of civilians in such circumstances .    3.9836678592130705
nevertheless , we now have more precise information : we know that the acting russian president himself , mr vladimir putin , asked russian special services to safeguard andrey babitsky ' s life and freedom .    3.1306768043139153
this is an admission that confirms all our concerns and makes parliament ' s position on the case all the more appropriate , as it calls for a concurrent explanation of other cases of journalists who have disappeared in the chechen region during the conflict and the safeguarding of media coverage of a conflict that has reached unacceptable levels of violence .    3.401176713798584
moreover , we are asking the russian authorities to provide immediate clarification of conditions in the so - called detention centres , and remind them that those responsible for any arbitrary detention , maltreatment or killing of civilians are laying themselves open to accusations of crimes against humanity .    3.1165072837011736
we would ask the council and the commission for clear and prompt action and a political initiative which does not overlook the issue of human rights .    3.7550439560625817
mr president , in terms of human rights , there is of course a great deal amiss in chechnya .    4.636084292530278
we have received reports from human rights organisations saying that russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - i am talking about old men and women - in grozny .    3.297659986193701
citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air - UNK UNK .    3.8661954311563633
we insist that these violations of human rights are investigated .    3.6533213742983803
despite the pledges made , violations in , for example , UNK have still not been investigated .    3.620725270823876
international government organisations and non - governmental organisations must be allowed access , and the union ' s general council decided on 6 december 1999 to send representatives from the member states to ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there . i am , to say the least , curious to know how they are getting on .    4.360433000124479
the fate of andrey babitsky , the correspondent in grozny of radio liberty , who was arrested by russian troops , is a dramatic example of russian policy .    3.2656005629673737
it contravenes article 3 of the geneva convention of UNK and is a flagrant violation of the freedom of the press .    4.3361240762202815
we want information from the russian authorities as to mr babitsky ' s UNK and his state of health .    3.6307385945479167
mr president , a journalist is on a fact - finding mission and this calls for freedom .    2.8119711666876372
yet he is taken hostage and treated as a UNK of war .    3.9254212819384966
the war in chechnya , like any war , is a trail of horrors .    3.5326483124882735
the filtration camps are camps in which torture , rape and violations are perpetrated : we know that now .    3.0832230086008727
and just what is mr cfsp doing ?    3.3328708618694627
russia is a permanent member of the un security council and a full member of the council of europe and the osce , it has been invited to g7 and is a client of the imf and the world bank .    4.106534723109697
what are we doing about it ?    2.6215144825868015
i do not understand why the power centres of europe are keeping quiet , letting things pass and , by working with the russians as if nothing were amiss , giving its support to the government which is waging this war .    3.3794170790313762
i beg you to intervene .    3.3180831530928767
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the tragic case of the courageous russian journalist andrey babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which russia has sunk .    2.513924100002729
the entire federation is allowing itself to be taken in by the war propaganda .    3.7307101830721834
a UNK has become president and he has even been described as a reformer in some western quarters .    3.162247638470018
journalists , on the other hand , who are simply going about their work in russia , i . e . endeavouring to produce reports which are as objective as possible , are being treated like criminals .    4.14616647625534
the russian government appears to have lost its fundamental understanding of what democracy is about and truth appears to have become a threat in its eyes .    3.372439002728584
i can only reiterate my appeal to the council and the commission to stick to the rules .    3.5993570206867087
it is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the eu if it does not recognise democratic principles .    3.79148704389511
mr president , what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as ' terrorists ' and ' UNK ' ?    3.281566367697017
without any hesitation , the russian minister for internal affairs , vladimir UNK , earlier this week confirmed the answer to this revealing question .    3.2088167514953203
the victim of this exchange is said to be the 35 - year - old war correspondent of radio free europe / radio liberty , andrey babitsky .    3.214813184652642
i am using the phrase ' is said to be ' on purpose , because official chechen sources are still denying that they would have exchanged mr babitsky for a number of russian prisoners of war .    3.2612218693042268
in the meantime , the highest russian authorities are casting a UNK of UNK over the mysterious disappearance of this courageous journalist .    3.1061350947877195
for example , acting president vladimir putin gave an assurance last monday that he had ordered the country ' s security services to bring the missing UNK back to moscow safely .    3.282685316284601
russia ' s new strong man , however , added a rather UNK comment to this welcome declaration : ' as far as i am aware , mr babitsky already feels free . '    3.7749693272999467
this distressing ambiguity on the part of the kremlin is not really surprising .    3.94705360467928
the facts are clear .    3.7691481801302795
andrey babitsky was an unwanted UNK in mr putin ' s ' anti - terrorist ' operation in chechnya .    3.064506231725001
hence his disappearance of over one month .    3.183184692939311
in any case , the babitsky affair warrants one conclusion : the leaders in moscow cannot possibly maintain that hostage - taking and trading in defenceless citizens is a specifically chechen crime .    2.6484195686018643
this resolution is already the fourth in a row within a short space of time in connection with the chechen tragedy .    3.461192693740087
nor is it a mere luxury .    3.1764756604397566
indeed , it is in line with some thirty russian media bodies which yesterday distributed a special issue on andrey babitsky free of charge .    2.939601542528099
cambodia    6.052992310329752
mr president , commissioner , it is because of my experience in the balkans , when i was there on duty , that i call on you today to support the efforts of the secretary - general of the united nations to bring those responsible for the genocide in cambodia to trial before an independent court under the aegis of the united nations .    3.447606504115592
i do not think that reconciliation is possible after such UNK tragedies , unless those responsible for starting them are brought to trial and sentenced .    2.971053714503628
nor do i think that the people who were their victims can give them a fair trial .    3.6136915683574355
i became convinced of this in UNK when i had to negotiate the periodic exchanges of prisoners which accompanied each successive ceasefire agreement , none of which unfortunately lasted , between the parties to the conflict .    3.2286194056574753
every time , just as the exchange was about to take place , we found men missing from the UNK drawn up lists .    3.748312508645674
every time , when we asked why , the reply was the same , ' we cannot release him : he is a war criminal ' .    3.716671082676071
in the UNK , pain and fury of the agreements , it was impossible to break the UNK circle of blood and vengeance .    3.3847025910094035
if we want to help the cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked , we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus UNK the simple UNK and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them .    3.949794608351889
this will be the only way for the cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace .    3.760822477291814
mr president , it became known this week that two prominent cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have UNK the king and prime minister .    3.000260886335361
these papers actively support the opposition politician , mr sam rengie .    3.0308325421413023
legal proceedings have been initiated against sam rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason .    3.4440692917829163
in his millennium speech , he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to king UNK in the event of his death .    4.0010769899250835
in march of last year , a member of sam rengie ' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of UNK .    3.8172433771489214
in september , two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a UNK attack on the prime minister .    4.699512707707218
this is notably the only party in cambodia which has no military arm .    3.013615874295703
in october , a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by UNK men and not released until the UNK was paid .    3.5800169206970764
the pattern of intimidation is clear .    3.2848725019070693
there is more going on in cambodia : prisoners are being tortured , the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children , and people are held on UNK to an excessive degree .    3.3937686169133214
all this is happening on a daily basis .    3.1277901232432965
even more serious is the government ' s refusal to bring the leaders of the khmer rouge before an international tribunal .    3.556241164969677
it is true , the civil war in cambodia is over and political tension has UNK .    2.9250527031275406
the way in which the political opposition is now being treated , however , gives us cause for great concern and , if it carries on like this , it is bound to impact on the union ' s relations with cambodia .    4.7680394957754055
mr president , there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law , according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes , and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights , not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected .    3.881887336100943
living examples of this have been the pinochet - UNK case , kosovo and , in UNK form in our own union , the debate surrounding the government decision in austria .    4.698786873414315
this is what is at stake now in cambodia unless the leaders of the previous UNK regime are bought to justice .    3.3145331560436233
at the same time , the struggle against impunity is under threat .    2.4957367960882593
the situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the treaty for an international criminal court has been UNK slow .    4.192805288511626
. mr president , we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday .    4.160082409737042
i am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - kosovo , angola , chechnya and cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge .    4.238765855684477
first of all , on kosovo , the commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards kosovo , as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in serb UNK .    3.9454970342339735
our efforts in kosovo , as elsewhere in the wider region , are directed at short and medium - term recovery and long - term stabilisation .    3.7803604501830446
in particular we support the development of a free , democratic and multi - ethnic society .    3.648873758004446
our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and , in particular , to try to build confidence between the various communities .    4.638072507349481
we have always condemned ethnic violence , no matter which ethnic group is the UNK or the victim .    3.7024181131176523
we consider it is unacceptable against serb and roma minorities as it was against the kosovar albanians in the past .    3.291501131139492
we support the efforts of unmik , kfor and the osce to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order .    3.6486844886821
in this regard we strongly support the high representative ' s recent appeal to member states to provide more police officers for the un civil police mission in kosovo .    3.308506063762409
it was a point raised by several speakers in the debate .    3.569339458404215
i hope it will underline the importance , when we address the development of a common foreign and security policy , of looking at the non - military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects .    3.509290015513716
it is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity .    3.04425278155152
we continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in serb prisons .    3.744165890418668
i totally agree with the points put so passionately by the mrs pack , either before trial or following judgement .    3.0549947913860613
the plight of kosovar albanians who have been missing since the end of the war is particularly distressing .    3.8628161343919825
we call on everyone , within and outside kosovo , to support these common aims , to support unmik and kfor in their efforts to achieve them .    3.791453371347828
turning briefly to angola , we had again a number of UNK speeches , especially from mr soares , with his UNK knowledge of the subject .    4.045081674084043
the commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in angola .    3.073440792708628
it is a vital precondition for strengthening democratic institutions and civil society .    2.769667408610399
an area of special concern is the harassment of journalists , including temporary detention of members of the so - called independent press .    3.8373011383194444
the european union made a specific démarche on press freedom to the angolan ministry of justice in november last year .    3.256967923491556
we fully support the work of the un through UNK , given its specific responsibility to monitor the human rights situation in angola .    3.8077660296990237
we are also committed to the security council ' s sanctions against unita , including arms controls .    3.529507588021716
an essential element will be support for democracy and human rights , including specific initiatives to strengthen democratic institutions and civil society .    3.2109947962923036
the european union has condemned the use of anti - personnel landmines and we are supporting de - mining operations through an international ngo .    3.57038802619257
the resolution i would love to have a debate on in parliament one day is on demining , and particularly the importance of destroying the stocks of existing mines : stocks in the ukraine , stocks in moldova and stocks elsewhere .    3.4002340699544527
this is a subject which is not given sufficient attention .    3.6482792071686614
on the question of the indigenous peoples in the us , i am sure that the resolution which was primarily addressed to the us authorities will have been noted by them .    3.7398768591404217
our general policy however , is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society , something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with north america .    4.251234077897586
the commission shares the growing concern about the missing russian journalist , mr babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in chechnya more generally .    3.371118275706001
this issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in chechnya , and i have heard mr posselt on this subject before .    3.817811925163165
there are alarming reports of human rights violations .    3.268535032550005
the commission delegation in moscow participated in a european union troika démarche on the UNK of this month .    3.4276883294431832
we underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the russians to clarify the circumstances of mr babitsky ' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights .    3.4923190465407252
we await a proper response from the russians .    3.305075392217488
in the meantime , the conclusions of the general affairs council earlier this week have confirmed the message which i have given today .    3.595145835156696
and we are ready to return to the issue at the eu - russia ministerial troika in lisbon on 2 march , if we need to do so .    4.219593139085069
finally , on cambodia and the khmer rouge : we strongly agree that senior khmer rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes .    2.759493284648926
the european union underlined its full support for the efforts of the united nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former khmer rouge leaders .    3.7886835334520303
at the same time , we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties .    3.0868746092310078
i am encouraged by the optimism of UNK UNK , secretary - general of the un , on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal .    4.353690890184424
the commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law , democratic principles and human rights with cambodian authorities through the ec - cambodia cooperation agreement which entered into force on 1 november last year .    2.9180970332662235
it has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days .    2.9227352011815446
i hope we have other opportunities , but i hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead .    3.6023113580433095
thank you very much commissioner patten .    2.5140397277673427
the vote will take place at 6 . 00 p . m .    1.9475976584262928
danube environmental disaster    5.130838036810432
the next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions :    1.9993195686368757
b5 - 0167 / 2000 by mr UNK and mrs thors on behalf of the group of the european democrat and reform party ,    3.329862890620759
b5 - 0168 / 2000 by mr UNK and mrs grossetête on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and the european democrats ,    2.7483135018035196
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mr papayannakis and mr sjöstedt on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left ,    2.651003733819476
b5 - UNK / 2000 by mrs schroedter and others on behalf of the group of the greens / european free alliance    2.751854939242901
on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a romanian UNK into the lepos , somes , tisza and danube rivers .    3.0012936901611917
mr president , we debated the framework directive on water this week , and the disaster in romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water .    4.176450321173908
this disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a european union .    3.8521254788993544
we are delighted with the pledge that eu aid will be used to clean the rivers , and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in romania and , more generally , in central and eastern europe .    3.16629861053031
we therefore welcome commissioner wallström ' s brief visit , for it can contribute to this awareness .    3.4471894227795423
after all , this is a candidate country we are talking about , and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the eu environmental rules in time .    4.5338918732707185
the polluter ought to pay .    3.4301939805842605
i wonder whether the european union can UNK this kind of cost from the environmental UNK who appear in the so - called ' wild east ' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place .    3.7719543027221833
mr president , commissioner , there has been one ecological disaster after another and , unfortunately , they are all similar .    3.547153424582479
once again , there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important UNK in europe .    3.189651367694846
the delta of the danube is in danger .    3.9317684860002426
as in spain in april 1998 , as in brittany and the vendée since last december , once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat .    3.479737549539447
the european parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger , which threatens our environment , UNK our ecosystem and again weakens our populations .    3.32828657198939
this new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries .    3.3747464675400147
the authorities in these counties , which are still very UNK from an environmental point of view , need to overcome numerous obstacles .    3.7920151919957146
first , they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites ; then they need to have suitable technical means of UNK and containing this type of pollution and , finally , they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites .    4.300349821230883
today , the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted , which is why the european union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with community environmental protection standards .    3.840159960646186
but , over and above that , it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question .    4.003454264068496
i hope that our future partners will demonstrate greater responsibility .    2.8350856673744986
it must form the basis for our partners ' political will .    3.497298368030351
implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop , it will also have social and economic benefits and , at the same time , public health standards will improve .    4.439001523010398
the efforts already being made need to be stepped up .    3.5390371563566116
the european continent needs to demonstrate solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly defined on the basis of the ' polluter pays ' principle .    3.1764608393913627
mr president , when the doñana disaster occurred , the non - governmental organisation , the world wide fund for nature , gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in europe .    3.9252111782601897
the number is huge . they are an ecological time bomb and affect the drinking water supply , ecological wealth and economic future of surrounding areas .    3.121429100433706
i therefore believe that the european union must , to start with , carry out an analysis of the situation of these reservoirs and compile a precise record of the number of these in europe .    3.951367686201257
we must bring these reservoirs under community law and the directives on waste and we must use the precautionary principle to ensure that this type of event does not happen again .    4.132630911008691
if we do not , we will be permanently endangering the ecological wealth of our continent .    3.197577742465176
mr president , this disaster at the mine in romania affects a large UNK area with rivers and watercourses in romania , hungary , serbia and bulgaria , the fact that 100 000 UNK of cyanide - UNK water and large quantities of heavy metals have leaked out into the ecosystem is going to have appalling consequences for people in the area for a very long time to come , as well as for animal and plant life , agriculture , the tourist industry , biodiversity and the whole of the ecosystem .    3.6188153951184643
it is incomprehensible that an accident of this kind could have happened at all today .    3.4146260651300073
is a substance as poisonous as cyanide really to be used in the mining industry and in the production of metals ?    3.7646527413243485
the answer , of course , is an emphatic no .    4.054953003382327
there must be no more manufacture or use of cyanide .    2.9227933689481564
i assume , therefore , that the eu will take the initiative and see to it that there is a total , worldwide ban on the manufacture and use of that substance .    4.052584885179504
it has already been banned in most eu countries for a long time now .    3.6241699028268948
that an accident like this can happen at all is therefore an extremely shameful state of affairs .    3.523735325397528
i have been informed that the commissioner for the environment , margot wallström , has travelled from strasbourg to romania in order to see for herself , on the spot , what has happened .    3.8671061029134455
this highlights the need for something which we in the group of the greens / european free alliance have been demanding for an extremely long time , namely a rapid reaction force offering protection to civilians in the event of major environmental and industrial catastrophes of this type .    3.663402183751996
it also UNK light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant states .    3.7642367903870975
we must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people ' s health and the ecosystems .    3.230883148287406
for example , the UNK from the UNK basins at the gold mines in UNK , in france , have caused tremendous pollution and are a huge economic disaster even today .    3.8552524633194225
we know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions .    2.651595764634717
who is going to pay ?    3.8459188706889793
which is why the environmental aspect , which is becoming a matter of urgency , must be taken into account in all development projects at all costs .    3.850669798141214
i too should like to ask the european union to put its own house in order here , i . e . to call on member states which still have gold mines to commission expert reports , so that we know just what the situation is .    4.020283719496581
i am thinking in particular of the gold mines in french UNK , where the workers , who are generally women , are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions .    3.1568375993161095
. let me associate myself , not least as a former environment minister , completely and without any reservation whatsoever , with the expressions of concern by honourable members .    3.7327430654214995
an objective assessment of the facts is not easy at this stage .    4.166935259348046
but early reports suggest that the poisoning of the lepos , tisza , somes and danube rivers is a very serious environmental tragedy .    3.052128819105364
it has destroyed an entire ecosystem in a matter of days .    3.2475866065237304
no living organisms , from UNK to UNK , have been spared .    4.8698841092391
several members have set out what seems to have happened .    3.4734505899903256
we have all seen some of the consequences on our television UNK .    3.8144442725617482
some environmental experts have put the environmental consequences of this disaster , at least so far as damage to the ecosystem is concerned , on a par with chernobyl .    4.550205037597791
it has affected the peoples of three countries - romania , hungary and yugoslavia .    3.2466333444332247
it is the tisza , hungary ' s second river , perhaps its most beautiful and most UNK by its people , that has borne the UNK .    3.155926007763358
some estimates suggest that it could take up to five years to UNK the river .    4.351979282219119
there is a continuing threat to other wildlife from eating toxic fish .    2.8905388022094787
we plainly have a responsibility to do everything we can , as rapidly as we can , to help cope with this catastrophe .    4.530230361376933
that is certainly the view of my colleague , commissioner wallström , who i know would have wished to respond to this resolution in person today .    3.511799607200876
the reason she cannot do so is because , as some honourable members have pointed out , she is in hungary and romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the UNK and romanian authorities to tackle the crisis .    3.978336888893726
we stand ready to do so .    2.7350949883199513
we contacted the romanian government and the international commission for the protection of the danube river about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently .    3.694808231389974
the UNK have approached UNK and UNK , in geneva , for an assessment of the damage in the danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts .    4.097964288119768
we stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from hungary and romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed . that is obviously crucial .    3.6028607612285835
it is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it .    3.458179082158316
it is to that end that our efforts are now engaged .    3.7324595171226247
there is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the romanian authorities .    3.5743838263455614
this is an important point , as several speakers have suggested .    3.064345240031233
it is mirrored in the international convention for the protection and sustainable use of the danube river and it should be applied in this case .    4.336269991021165
the european union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due .    2.9310239434172045
the union has mobilised some eur 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the danube river basin .    3.3274561294710265
in the context of pre - accession aid to the region it may be possible to UNK some of the assistance we are giving under UNK and phare to tackle the most severe impact of this accident , as long as the polluter - pays principle is fully respected .    4.018721083892505
we will want , in the longer term , to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster , above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place .    4.238007261143979
the incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of european civil protection , along the lines suggested by president prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two members today .    3.5332105582407616
but for now the priority is to cope with this crisis .    3.4654690412035416
as i have said , my colleague , commissioner wallström , is on the spot today .    3.2245347803239164
she will want to keep parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit .    3.5567697829536202
this has been an appalling tragedy for europe and europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to UNK our future .    3.529632296028263
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
we shall now proceed to the vote .    1.8722281289198166
vote    3.0905809937555753
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) the only reason we voted for the pse - verts / ale - gue / ngl compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the goodyear - UNK management to close its factory in italy .    3.023998089060951
however , the measures set out in this resolution are derisory in terms of combating the policy of the major industrial groups which are shedding jobs and UNK unemployment .    4.204253970584371
moreover , it is all just words , because the socialist governments , which are now in a majority in europe , are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right - wing governments .    4.404142177453345
the only way of stopping the UNK machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit , on pain of compulsory purchase , and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public .    3.8358861947504264
society must have the means of enforcing its own agenda on large companies and their owners . the first item on that agenda is the eradication of unemployment .    3.743463185488304
the sums needed to create useful jobs in public services and finance the distribution of work among everyone , without cutting wages , must be taken from the profits of large companies .    3.545818134230333
it is far more important for the majority of society than the waste involved in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders .    3.57632475137333
. ( sv ) i cannot support the present resolution because , in paragraph 8 , an individual factory in italy is singled out with the express wish that precisely this establishment should remain in place , while the current management is being advised to try to sell the factory to a european UNK manufacturer .    3.6981161036163828
it is not the european parliament ' s business to express an opinion on which factories in the european union ' s 15 member states are to remain in place and which are to be shut down ; to expand their work forces or reduce them ; stay in the same location or else move ; be sold or not be sold ; and , in the case of those which are to be sold , to comment on whether they are to be sold to companies within or outside europe .    4.171117175213044
ultimately , it is a question of different spheres of authority , where the european parliament and its members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands .    3.9777970231733053
the swedish christian democrats would emphasise the value of the european union ' s and the european parliament ' s concentrating on their basic tasks and not undermining the value of their actions in these areas by also acting in areas outside their jurisdiction .    3.881141037566628
tourism and employment    5.334120954678233
the next item is the report ( UNK / 2000 ) by mr viceconte , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , on the communication from the commission : ' enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment - follow - up to the conclusions and recommendations of the high level group on tourism and employment ' [ com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cos ) ] .    2.297539805365868
, rapporteur .    3.0254899515358007
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , despite the european union ' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully - fledged community policy on tourism , increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs .    3.6216928286499357
one of the reasons for the community ' s interest is the structural flexibility of this sector of the employment market , which explains its UNK for women and young people , to whom it often offers their first experience of employment .    3.662648867836156
the importance of the tourist industry and its impact on employment - although everyone is now aware of this - is nevertheless based more on personal experience rather than on verifiable statistical data .    3.618593152604904
the fact that , due to the absence of sufficiently reliable and scientific statistical data , the tourist industry is in effect an unknown quantity has greatly limited the prospects of pursuing a consistent policy in this area and creating employment on a wider scale .    3.2533518062965223
it would be appropriate , therefore , to begin by UNK the impact of tourism on the lives of union citizens and the UNK , in both economic and social terms , of promoting the european tourist industry .    4.744587142838279
tourism must therefore be thought of as the whole range of goods and services required by individuals moving from their UNK place of residence and thus confers mobility , the characteristic feature of contemporary society .    3.2634673572433726
the term ' tourism ' must no longer be solely perceived as synonymous with sun , sea and holidays , which has the effect of reducing the interest taken in the subject at institutional level .    3.2124495984443184
secondly , i would like to UNK a UNK , taking as a starting point an apparent paradox , which is clearly highlighted by eurostat figures : the main international tourist countries are not those traditionally regarded as tourist destinations , but on the contrary the most advanced nations , whose quality of life is one of their main attractions and most heavily promoted features .    3.7553685900010536
it is an obvious truth , and one that is measurable by other economic and social indicators , that thanks to tourism , many mediterranean regions have undergone a radical change for the better in their economic and social system and the way of life of their inhabitants , and achieved a drastic reduction in the numbers UNK .    3.748205146476671
social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists , thus creating an entire productive system .    3.821103951125563
in such cases , there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers , thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy .    3.6695286880233358
this reminds us that tourism cannot be regarded as the poor countries ' petroleum industry , because it requires huge investment in structures , infrastructures , entrepreneurship , professional expertise , social services and training ; that the tourist industry is essential for the equilibrium of many regions as it provides a direct source of employment and a market for all local productive activities : agriculture , small firms in the industrial and craft sector , transport , services , retail sector , training , etc ; that the development of the community ' s tourist industry is closely linked to its sustainability with regard to the community objectives ; that the varied geography and historical , cultural and environmental heritage must be protected and exploited .    3.4998867823999054
in my opinion , the european union can , in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity , supplement the action of the member states and contribute to consolidating the potential of tourism by means of certain measures , such as the adoption of a specific legal basis for tourism policy in the treaties ; the adoption of mechanisms within the programmes and projects set up under its regional policies and other policies of the union , with a view to promoting tourism in all its forms : rural , environmental , cultural , conference - based , spa - related and sports - related tourism , and also tourism focusing on senior citizens , research and training ; the amendment of directive 95 / 57 / ec on the collection of statistical information in the field of tourism ; the cofinancing of projects to set up new transport services and infrastructures ; the cofinancing of pilot schemes involving benchmarking and the exchange of experiences .    3.842339809108283
these and other specific measures included in my report can , in my view , lend added value to the actions that the competent national and regional authorities should foster , in order to promote tourism and create new jobs , starting with the adoption of positive fiscal measures to assist small and medium - sized firms , particularly by reducing the burden of charges on labour .    3.786653974399729
mr president , commissioner , before i explain to you the position of the committee on women ' s rights and equal opportunities , i would like to share with you three basic factors which , in my opinion , determine the present and future of european tourism in an international environment .    3.4126930528147694
in europe today , the tourism market contributes 5 . 5 % of the gross national product and UNK a rather significant proportion of the workforce , approximately 6 % .    3.5966613830847822
those figures are UNK higher for some countries .    3.3814972828752126
to grasp the importance of tourism for some parts of europe , it is worth pointing out that in my own country , greece , a country that attracts tourists , over the past four decades , during which the farming population has clearly aged and the population is over - concentrated in the major urban centres , the only areas which have retained populations of low average age or to which young people have returned are ones where tourism has developed .    3.7202184850707405
it is therefore clear that besides being a matter of general economic interest for europe , tourism is a priority for the economic and social participation of the european union ' s regions .    4.064222316938176
another factor is that the world market is growing UNK .    4.744779502000302
the forecast is for ten billion tourists in 2010 , but unfortunately for europe there is a reverse trend .    3.597708314152224
europe ' s share of the increase is falling drastically each year to the benefit of asia , the far east and america .    3.379957887373868
you see , the world tourism market is influenced every day and directly by the liberalisation of transport , its reduced cost , and competition from new centres of tourism outside europe .    3.3434814272072346
furthermore , 90 % of businesses active in tourism are small or medium - sized , the very enterprises which form the living UNK of our social and economic tissue , which are called upon to tackle the new obstacles and respond positively to the challenges of this global development .    3.834090013698738
as the rapporteur said , this becomes particularly important when tourism is appreciated as a unitary productive system because of its ability to absorb large quantities of agricultural and industrial products , services and transport and to create a significant amount of added value .    3.4258745953836405
here , then , i want to point out that international competition is tough and , if we are to overcome it positively , we must together UNK and share a long - term strategy .    4.620863923661418
we must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism , so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age .    4.223155670473901
today , nobody can ignore the fact that new digital technologies and systems , with internet at the sharp end , mobile telephones and digital television , are bringing about radical changes in tourism as a whole and its respective structures and operational models .    3.310305415689607
the introduction of these new technologies is not a threat , but a new opportunity for our tourism because it offers the potential to provide new and innovative tourism products and services , which our tourism needs for an ever - UNK tourism season , so that it can attract new customers and offer new and alternative forms of tourism .    3.724005934149393
the new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally UNK , non tourist areas , which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments .    3.4853065373198695
to this new labour market there must be a response in the programmes of tourism schools and training programmes for company staff , including programmes for training the unemployed and their re - introduction to work .    3.3506948164809387
the committee on women ' s rights paid particular attention to the issue of education , because according to official figures women account for 53 % of those engaged in tourism services , and in parallel , they form a majority among the working people most easily affected by social and economic change .    3.5822908479231637
we must not forget that people working in tourism , especially women , encounter particular problems such as seasonal work , the need to renew contracts from one year to the next , social protection , lack of interest in continuing education , and reduced possibilities for development .    3.4826305045080574
we therefore ask the european commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development .    4.147450942174999
mr president , i would like to begin with some words of optimism , which came to us in the form of the high - level group communication of october 1998 , the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade , it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the union .    3.621927646704531
in addition , it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created .    3.3764605617055197
the commission and parliament are called upon to answer two questions : what are the right conditions and what is the role of the european union on this ?    4.096268942762039
the commission and parliament can help us understand , in the first place , exactly what we are dealing with , because even the term ' tourism ' , as was , moreover , pointed out in the viceconte report , is still an ambiguous term , a kind of UNK that depends on UNK , climate , a range of opportunities , and a series of background factors ; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production , income , wealth and employment .    4.202541660196897
there is a shortage of facts : we have no information on the economic impact , which still remains a complete mystery .    4.0035793309274945
we have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other , despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the commission and parliament .    3.362619424755421
with the aim of working out a strategy , it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible , so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs .    3.9767510059487488
this does not follow automatically : often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry , without this being matched by an increase in employment .    3.744534979834736
there is no legal basis , and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector .    4.058194599287824
a legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies , to coordinate and to programme , all vital factors for making european union tourism competitive with other markets .    3.1208859602244354
a legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the structural funds , as was the case in the past , to obtain some loose change .    3.4492851988425146
moreover , only minimal amounts were made available to us : we should bear in mind that the commission communication indicated amounts totalling eur 4 700 000 000 over the last five years , which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway .    3.7311966417005253
there is no opportunity to send a strong message to the member states : recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the states to acknowledge one of the european union ' s competences which at the moment , is only exercised in fits and starts .    4.1583108210364195
we fully endorse the community measures which were recommended in the commission communication : UNK taxation , that is , fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95 % of which , i would point out , is made up of small and medium - sized businesses , which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium - sized businesses in the european tourism sector ; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the european union , and therefore to investing in training ; finally , it undertakes to make the job market transparent .    4.161237501451167
the tourism market is by definition a flexible market ; we do not want this flexibility to be seen in a solely negative light , with seasonal work being misinterpreted as illegal work : remember that 50 % of employment , especially in southern countries of the european union , is done on the black economy .    3.7820826382457793
we feel that the european union and the commission needs to make a strong commitment to sustainable tourism , which means having a strategy that is compatible with the environment , after the excesses of recent years when private wealth often did not correspond to high levels of employment .    3.8247478660597785
first and foremost , we need to compete in terms of quality .    4.864557453236547
finally , we consider that tourism can , in addition to being a growth factor , be a factor for democracy , and in this regard we are asking the commission for a clear , conscious commitment .    4.658581930297684
mr president , there are three points i wish to address .    3.748395789654977
the first is the inclusion of a legal base in the treaty .    3.523634313866833
this is something i favour , but currently as part of a minority in my own group .    3.788583977208771
we are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economies and as a factor of european integration .    3.888172436957374
the problem for some of us , however , is the lack of specification of the extent of the legal base and of just how it would relate to considerations of subsidiarity .    4.116759729172772
the resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism .    3.6251155962235377
at the same time the commission is currently concerned about UNK itself to core tasks .    3.2995253395610367
the question has to be asked whether some of the activities suggested in the resolution might not put more pressure on its resources than is desirable .    4.366744963916675
third , there are several references in the resolution to permanent employment .    4.089098230020906
of course the promotion of this is desirable and permanent employment need not necessarily mean full - time employment .    3.431624781877112
but there will always be people who are looking for seasonal employment .    3.819844915130889
students are an obvious example .    3.661083559111284
we have some concern that the resolution does not give enough consideration to them and to ways in which their interests could receive specific protection .    3.7300615885815795
thus , while complimenting mr viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend , we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed .    3.995717529490617
mr president , i too believe that tourism has a very important role to play , not just in our european regions , but throughout the world , because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development .    4.033558728599812
but it is also a very vulnerable sector , as we recently saw with the oil slick .    3.637071756351114
a UNK tourist sector can be totally wiped out by an ecological disaster such as an oil slick .    3.2100027145931707
when it comes to tourism , we can no longer do what we like where we like .    3.7440848235799318
there are huge reserves ; certain zones , rural zones , so - called zones lagging behind but which still have UNK nature and UNK natural habitats , are listed as having good potential for what we call eco - tourism or green tourism .    3.102924447690452
this could be developed and provide a large number of new jobs .    3.8474037964091203
but these regions need to take real account of positive and negative experiences in other tourist sectors .    3.352922070770147
we must not kill the goose that lays the golden UNK of tourism .    2.7096456032751233
tourism must be environmentally friendly if it is to continue to be an asset in the future .    4.210857149305562
i can think of many mountain regions which are continually UNK in order to develop a tourist sector .    3.9890036327017233
i should also like to refer to the darker side of tourism , the tourism exported from the member states of the european union . i am referring to sex tourism .    3.59772081179862
i know that action is being taken against this so - called tourism elsewhere , but we must remember the european union ' s responsibility at this level .    4.342190062479604
under no circumstances can we , as responsible politicians , allow what is currently happening to continue , with young girls practically bought in the countries of the east and coming here to be abused on the cheap .    3.2911293414396066
finally , i should like to refer to the tourism which gives citizens contact with the outside world and democracy .    3.2067589339164546
i am thinking in particular of countries such as cuba which are isolated but i know , because i have travelled there extensively , that the cubans who come into contact with tourists can learn something of the outside world , obtain different information and pass on different information .    3.2226099541353297
for all these reasons , i think that reforming the treaties would allow the huge tourist question , which is an important asset for the whole planet , to be properly integrated .    4.403836446289808
mr president , during the most recent meeting of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i was pleasantly surprised .    2.759599293611204
the opinion of mr sánchez garcía , addressed to the committee on constitutional affairs , contained a remark regarding the igc .    3.3617856225743386
the draftsman of the opinion held the view that there was no need for a legal foundation for tourism in the treaty .    4.202095991834677
this was in contrast to the majority opinion held in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .    2.9373936779451815
having heard many members who share the view expressed in the opinion , this was a real relief .    4.587591829955681
unfortunately , his text has not UNK the vote .    3.6387418256375317
it does , however , support my view that i am not , apparently , the only one who cannot agree with the majority opinion .    4.747969762048664
this brings me to the content of the report .    2.7217459276101668
an important aspect of the tourism industry is employment and potential employment .    3.461922463960373
especially in the southern member states , the tourist industry is a major source of income .    4.159698308568896
from this vantage point , there is every reason for the government to formulate stimulating measures and a stimulating policy .    3.897277998375639
the seasonal nature of tourism and the employment fluctuations that this entails also deserve attention .    3.422033069372776
this is not desirable , either from the point of view of tourism itself or the stimulation of employment .    2.990777853084501
the discrepancies between the different regions can often be traced back to cultural or historical factors .    3.0566523292170715
within these regions , a huge range of problems have their part to play .    3.7180172788878845
it is obvious that mainly local and regional - and , therefore , to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy .    3.4152014881731234
for this reason , i cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to european level .    3.3621364457823377
in addition , employment policy in general is also a factor .    4.2281619014870495
here too , the structure of the economy differs for each member state , and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse .    4.415307426770533
it will not do for one type of policy , probably with many exceptions and UNK , to be applied .    3.641952326477035
this would mean that the eu would UNK be removing tasks from member states and that the brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily .    3.5890924598662766
it is preferable for member states to take measures to stimulate employment themselves .    3.3305372081022138
their expertise , is , of course , UNK to that of the commission .    3.955625142024033
this is why i am very hesitant when it comes to formulating community measures to promote employment .    3.3625476627919975
even in the tourism industry .    3.844184997109433
it would really be a nuisance if parliament were to attempt to achieve this UNK by extending its powers .    3.4815278047600158
mr president , you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands .    3.708243709640924
first of all i should like to thank mr viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report .    3.43853281187598
it is a very extensive report .    3.1264541193768127
we greatly welcome it , just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on , the report of the high - level working group which was set up by the european commission .    4.275579522753845
i hope that the commission will not forget that .    3.407355580647961
having set it up , i hope the commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust .    3.6602405460771292
tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation .    3.133959723811867
as has already been said in this debate , three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for .    3.3816085482659313
europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy - making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position .    4.425864857925767
we need a more dynamic vision based on tourism ' s contribution to job creation .    2.9727022405584704
we must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross - border activity and therefore deserves a european policy with a stimulating , innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development .    3.0256464848503053
i know the commissioner is very keen on information technology .    3.65811455792124
he has convinced me of that .    3.15619893082741
but his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together .    3.30645869572535
there are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test - UNK , therefore , for integrating job creation strategies .    3.540358619655749
let us look at some of these reasons .    3.6006860579539786
the importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one .    4.121018376900496
various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry , particularly the more vulnerable groups , such as young people , women and the unskilled .    4.298392716495714
i am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first .    3.766575731677241
the availability of unskilled , temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the community .    4.59817451428616
tourism contributes to regional development - in rural areas that are maybe trying to diversify - and tourism contributes to urban areas that aim to raise the profile of their own cultural heritage .    3.598679794512276
if we take all these aspects together we have the potential of really doing something in europe and maybe extending the tourism season by staggering holidays right across europe .    3.4847556942168585
we must not lose sight of the fact that with enlargement we have the potential to increase the number of visitors who come to europe ' s shores to see some of the traditional cultural heritage that has not been opened up to the world for quite a number of years - in fact , about forty years .    4.428311943863539
we are losing market share .    3.2018038620238145
i believe we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive .    3.3491196997520425
i hope you will help us .    3.073233769763093
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , today we are addressing a very important sector that directly involves over 10 million jobs in the european union and helps the more or less disadvantaged , island and remote areas to stand on their own feet .    3.1096765229713945
and of course , tourism creates more jobs and contributes to the stimulation of employment , especially among society ' s more sensitive sections : women and young people .    3.4638001061914006
in view of all this , i think it is a serious contradiction that there is no european policy on tourism .    4.288668437894929
the lack of any legal base makes it impossible to adopt measures relating to the sector .    3.4009228698966107
the occasional application of article UNK - formerly article UNK - which requires unanimity , has prevented the adoption of a programme even of only eur 8 million for five years and 15 member states .    3.5054279546465024
the measures taken from time to time in the past have been fragmentary and therefore ineffective , and such provisions as have been made were dictated by parallel policies such as consumer protection , environmental policy , transport policy , taxation policy , etc . , which very often are not only no help to tourism but on the contrary make it more difficult , since their introduction has usually entailed costs for the tourism industry without regard to its ability to bear them or its incentives to cope with them .    3.6667666487813078
with sorrow , i stress that in the context of restructuring the commission ' s services , tourism is dealt with by a section , not even a directorate , within the directorate - general for ' enterprise ' .    4.074443517058511
but we must support our tourism !    3.4661876610396725
in our view , the UNK which could create a basis for its support are : the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector , the framing of a community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market , coordination of the tourism policy with other , parallel community policies which affect it directly or indirectly , a study of the sector , and the adoption of medium and long - term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product .    4.062511806013865
mr president , commissioner , since the issue of employment has been raised , i want to recall another issue which is also very serious , namely the bankruptcies among tour operators and their consequences mainly for hotels , which are small or medium enterprises lacking the necessary organisation and access to information that would indicate to them whether or not their contractual partners are UNK .    3.707458058989211
clearly it is impossible to adopt measures at the national level .    3.739718137437263
in contrast , at european level it would be possible to look into measures for improving the relations between hotels and tour operators , for example a regulation of such relations , the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund , etc . , in collaboration with representatives from the two branches .    4.118766463901524
in the past , the commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies , so that it could form an opinion , and asked the european UNK of UNK - and - UNK owners and tourist agencies , UNK and UNK , to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them .    4.082108475308501
since then , however , there has been no progress .    4.034233998566809
there must therefore be measures to improve the quality and competitiveness of europe ' s tourism and , to the extent of the possible , safeguard the operation of companies .    4.480239419335917
such measures must also aim to promote rational use of natural and cultural assets and of the tourism infrastructure , so contributing to the balanced and sustainable development of tourism .    3.7280984135348842
i will end by congratulating mr viceconte and , as one who comes from UNK , a tourist area , i ask that we should always view tourism not only in terms of pleasant holidays but as a primary job creator in a europe which needs those jobs .    4.192128790250412
mr president , commissioner , the new attitude adopted recently by the commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who , in recent years , have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the community framework .    3.80227174628012
we all know that this change of heart is basically due to the close cause - effect relationship between tourism and employment . it is also due to the recognition by the european union , since the 1997 conference on these issues , of the enormous potential , represented by tourism , for employment .    4.452207496657624
in this respect the commission communication before us today is opportune , as is the report by mr viceconte whom i congratulate .    4.430864405571122
this report contains 34 conclusions , including 15 calls to the commission to adopt specific measures and actions without forgetting the environmental dimension and cultural protection , particularly in outermost and island regions .    3.6721192270247323
it also contains four calls to the member states which highlight the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities and the establishment of measures favourable to tourist - oriented smes , particularly in the tax sector and in access to financial instruments . these would encourage the growth of employment in sectors which use labour intensively , such as the tourist sector .    3.9758534888321497
finally , once this legal basis to which many of us aspire has been established so that a common tourism policy can be developed , we must be realistic and prepare a strategy on tourism and its relationship with employment , as proposed by the commission with the support of this house . in this strategy , young people and women , training and quality and the new information society must receive preferential attention .    4.182996639369859
mr president , commissioner , i should like to start by thanking mr viceconte for his report , which has drawn our attention to a sector which is all too often underestimated .    3.3781401571739376
tourism is a social , economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most european citizens , either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services .    3.3718200117109784
every year , nearly 200 million europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel , usually to other countries in europe .    3.6870984891149132
moreover , europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries , even though it faces increasingly UNK competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products .    3.292280378201589
since the treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real community tourism policy , the european union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment .    3.9137383809675366
vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in europe especially , as far as tourist service providers are concerned , in meeting UNK demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers .    3.746160422862815
employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious , thereby hampering its sustainable development .    3.2017288314016317
it is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible .    2.991957529060354
as the report notes , the adoption by the member states of tax incentives for smes in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour - intensive sectors and , consequently , in the tourism sector .    4.212539697249338
this sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions , especially the most remote and island regions , which have UNK assets in this area .    4.47154836494207
let us not forget that , in the most remote regions , tourism is the most important industry in terms of income .    4.141488321238002
the income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the community .    3.012012903197122
in addition , tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement , insofar as it makes us more aware of other european cultures and thus helps respect for european ways of life to develop .    3.1999638788368743
it goes without saying , therefore , that tourism , developed rationally in the long term , should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies , while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural , cultural , historical and environmental heritage .    3.387296271914509
i should like to close by stressing the essential role which the european union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental europeans to discover the most far - UNK destinations in europe , namely the most remote regions .    3.845632969966452
mr president , we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance . the basic document is really no more than a commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment .    3.468357408613891
not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 april 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old .    3.3464813875952393
this document stems from the previous commission . it is undoubtedly the result of work carried out by commissioner UNK throughout his term of office and which UNK in the luxembourg summit and his failed UNK programme .    4.1025907778252275
i believe this is the first debate in this house with the new commission and a new commissioner , mr liikanen , who is of course listening very closely to what we are discussing .    4.771820823611058
i would take this opportunity to ask him a couple of questions directly .    3.5017114338679614
firstly , the governments made a commitment at the maastricht conference of 1992 to include a legal basis for this issue in the treaties . this commitment was not fulfilled in the treaty of amsterdam of 1997 and is therefore outstanding .    3.9758388665574618
yet there is a council resolution from last june on tourism and employment .    3.507363249135023
what expectations does the commissioner have that the new intergovernmental conference which is starting will include this aspect ?    3.737912539121485
my second question is much more direct and perhaps more awkward .    2.9851038766179254
bearing in mind the failed efforts of the last decade , as highlighted by mr koch , does commissioner liikanen believe that he can do something during his term of office to ensure that the community dimension of tourism becomes a proper policy , given the importance that all the previous speakers have given to tourism in terms of employment ?    4.15794809766651
will the commission present new initiatives in order to see whether , through the constant efforts of the commission and parliament , we can gradually convince the council to do something on this issue ?    5.069222437903083
mr president , commissioner , first of all i would like to congratulate the rapporteur , mr viceconte , who spoke at such length on the tangible possibility , for the fifteen member states of the union , of creating jobs by way of a sensible policy , a sensible european union initiative in this field .    3.325677382628191
this very afternoon we have had a debate on workers who suddenly find themselves unemployed . we now hope to be able to solve these problems .    3.9765346481692254
tourism is an activity that falls decidedly and fundamentally within the competence of the european union .    2.799670114341454
all the european states are known throughout the world for being tourist UNK UNK by all , including the united states of america , which we spoke about this afternoon with regard to the native americans .    4.210323179483509
i would like to stress one point in the viceconte report which i welcome and particularly support , and which i would like the house and the commission to reflect on before giving a favourable response .    4.5671760374239865
it regards tourism for senior citizens .    3.236788526198635
i usually see commissioner diamantopoulou desperately UNK her hair out , bit by bit , because the elderly live too long , leading to problems with pension payments .    3.175799938378265
however , in this case , the fact that we are living longer means that there are more senior citizens .    4.276851109922893
unfortunately not all , but many of them travel the world to see its UNK and to discover and learn more about it : italians want to see what the english are like , the greeks want to see what the UNK are like and the french want to see their italian UNK .    3.959146435006861
tourism brings the peoples of the fifteen states and of the entire world closer together , and of course , it leads to peace and understanding .    4.318864459167553
this kind of tourism , which is undertaken mainly by large numbers of senior citizens , is just as important .    4.261651608284673
this type of tourism must be promoted and supported because it allows people to work in tourist destinations , not just during the summer when we go UNK in the sea , for example , but also during winter when we go to take the air .    4.595190360087767
unfortunately , this is not true of them all , but this is why i am calling on the commission to follow up on the viceconte report .    4.480557394546171
. mr president , i would first like to thank the rapporteur , mr viceconte and congratulate him on the report .    2.9153281420894146
i think we all acknowledge the economic , social and environmental importance of tourism in today ' s developed europe and its great potential for growth and employment .    3.0954391993361514
i am glad to see that the commission and parliament are converging towards the same goal in this area .    2.9644624424538466
employment issues are at present the core concern regarding tourism .    3.6039270656952813
an essential condition in order to make good progress in the work in this respect is that the cooperation with member states and the industry and with other partners be as fruitful as possible .    5.010545723435042
this will determine the success of our work .    3.498019614603412
this will also be important with a view to the special summit in march , where tourism is bound to be mentioned as a significant contributor to employment .    3.641720572942519
coordination of community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies , transport , employment , environment , culture and competition must strongly involve member states and the tourism industry itself .    3.757689752576182
as far as specific policies are concerned , i would like to pinpoint just one on which the draft resolution focuses - regional policy .    4.129900227540616
the commission guideline document for the new structural fund ' s programming period has already identified tourism as one of the areas with particular potential for employment creation through competitive enterprises .    3.5593850223125307
the commission expects member states to put increased emphasis on tourism measures in their plans and programming .    3.4047925110833455
quality , sustainability , innovation are at the forefront of the commission ' s own policy and are priorities recognised by the council of ministers .    3.857330269985564
quality products in order to improve competitiveness , sustainability in order to protect resources and innovation in particular through the use of information technologies .    4.293660937303138
regarding sustainability indicators , the european environment agency is already working with the commission on the issue .    4.7002430982488494
i want to mention , as has already been mentioned by many speakers today , that tourism related to the natural and cultural heritage is expected to be the fastest expanding form of tourism in the eu during the next two decades .    3.9144866991637803
these possibilities should be fully exploited .    3.640363653209387
mr provan said that i often talk a lot about tourism and information technology .    3.668618353421321
i am personally convinced that information and communication technologies will be a key competitiveness and innovation factor for european tourism .    3.3972569200660114
the travel and tourism sector is the front - UNK in making use of ict tools .    3.4934318212325985
this will dramatically change the way it operates .    3.5512668706227397
marketing , reservation and transport are expected to be the areas of UNK change and improvement .    3.8072271270386144
direct business to consumer contact will supplement , and sometimes also reduce , the currently , nearly exclusive business to business relationship .    3.209100676114259
it will give more and better choice to tourists and generate new and better tourist products .    3.0161454357409294
for the commission this requires that action in the tourism field must be tightly linked to measures promoting the take - up of information communication technology by the tourism industry , in particular by the innovation and innovative society technological programmes which are both within my competence .    3.632603130510605
the implementation of the directive on statistics aims at improving the knowledge of market structures and trends in european tourism and its industry .    3.617882545151437
commission decisions have advanced the methodological approach .    3.214277825132354
the report on the experience acquired in the work carried out under this directive is part of our work programme for the current year .    4.613608016906014
more work on the social and economic impact of tourism is currently on - going with the international organisations , such as the world tourism organisation .    4.246595333204781
the european community ' s prime role is to ensure a framework which enables and encourages stakeholders and authorities at all levels to optimise and realise the tourism sector ' s potential for growth and employment .    3.5237160125913762
such a european strategy will be achieved through building on the commitment by member states and the commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas : exchange and dissemination of information , notably through new technologies ; training in order to upgrade skills , quality of tourist products and sustainable development in tourism .    4.208263357686075
in the autumn the commission will report back on the progress made in this respect .    4.0488053816350105
a report on the work to be undertaken , together with the member states and the tourism industry should be available in about two years from now .    4.054759573285784
depending on the results of this work , a wider debate could then take place which might well be the starting - point for even more comprehensive policy initiatives .    3.7122330357934312
mr medina ortega asked me some very concrete questions .    2.887163475233077
as regards the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned , we must understand that many policy sectors have a huge impact on the framework on tourism .    4.1707763051680855
it is not only the targeted , specific tourism actions which are important but the other horizontal actions in the field of transport .    3.336077071712212
at the moment , the question of congestion of air and roads is the fundamental problem .    3.3138509021999534
we need to have this streamlined approach on tourism which covers all the policies .    3.3170206258671717
i am sure that we will improve on that in the future when we have had a good high - level working group report , your support with your report here and also when the tourism sector is part of enterprise policy .    4.148332878392703
why is it so important in that sector ?    3.585248505433941
it is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises ; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises .    3.6891845953173448
that is where the potential is .    3.0788138054725454
if we can eliminate the obstacles to make it cheaper to create new enterprises , to facilitate the access to financing and to change the attitude of society to be more positive entrepreneurship , i am sure the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from this .    4.3720906966388275
there is one problem that i hesitate to mention today as i am new in the sector .    3.3634764551282346
i have been working now in all industrial and service sectors , but when you look at the organisational structure in tourism it is almost impossible .    3.572055760798346
it is very difficult for a commissioner to try to work in an area where there are dozens of different organisations whose representativeness needs to be ascertained every time .    3.983663156860892
to strengthen the role of tourism in europe , the organisations should do what has happened in most economic sectors : seek better focus , better coordination and concentrated activities .    3.943769888471579
then we could have a solid dialogue in our everyday work .    3.546815111889127
that is the real difficulty which we must overcome .    3.5880703665741067
as far as the treaty is concerned , the intergovernmental conference started this week so we do not know the results yet .    4.050997972636465
i want to be very UNK : i have not seen much enthusiasm about that conference or the proposal to enlarge the powers of the eu .    4.079267112851044
tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the eu .    3.8046812909076566
we will see what happens but at the moment that seems to be the case .    4.192705802171258
finally , the commission welcomes the resolution which continues the line of the high - level group , the commission communication on enhancing tourism ' s potential for employment and the corresponding council conclusions .    3.489300861721443
the general agreement between both institutions in this field must not keep the commission from following the most pragmatic approach in achieving our common objectives .    3.4255463013852037
thank you , commissioner .    2.0399224292706255
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 9 a . m .    2.0416495376548287
( the sitting was closed at 7 . 40 p . m . )    2.1417500403727976
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.3506184552294846
the minutes of yesterday ' s sitting have been distributed .    1.9245484651696183
are there any comments ?    2.070454319710833
mr president , yesterday ' s minutes will naturally indicate interventions referring to the so - called ' strasbourg declaration " which intends to UNK the european parliament in certain considerations which would literally lead to the conclusion that i am a nazi .    3.9110648126116465
this declaration - which , as i have said , UNK the european parliament , although no such declaration was put before this parliament - is a completely unacceptable form of manipulation .    4.39412669006135
i thank the president , mrs fontaine , who just yesterday expressed her opinion by UNK the UNK of this house .    3.3960781845060692
mr president , as well as UNK the UNK , UNK UNK and the democratic government of the basque country - who have the kind of attitude which , in the case of ireland , deserved the nobel prize - by calling them nazis , the declaration insults representatives of the european citizens - as in my case : i represent a section of UNK society - by saying that we are more dangerous than the nazis , and insults groups which are clearly democratic , with decades of history , in an unacceptable and crazy way , which i would like to condemn here and now .    4.256552150153648
i would like these words to be heard , because the european parliament cannot be UNK in this way in a crazy declaration which i consider to be totally unacceptable .    4.501269533367557
thank you , mr nogueira , for your explanation .    3.298867915757245
i would remind you that questions on the minutes should refer to the minutes .    3.3258167783053634
in any event , for those members who not aware of the president ' s position , i will read the official communication and it will thereby appear in today ' s minutes :    4.458720145060314
the spanish vice - presidents of the european parliament were represented .    4.018229256629837
following this interview , the representatives of this forum presented her with a text entitled " strasbourg declaration " . the president wishes to specify that under no circumstances does she sanction the terms of this " declaration " .    3.1167651328762442
strasbourg , 17 february " .    3.667859140850306
i therefore believe that the issue is totally cleared up .    3.203861237829484
mr president , i would like to request a correction to the minutes regarding the vote on amendment no 5 of the swoboda report .    3.3498729136391865
we take note and this will appear in the minutes .    3.812833818432
mr president , this is not exactly a point of order but concerns a communication we have before us today , namely that the conference of presidents open to members , which was scheduled for 23 february , has now been cancelled .    3.491439836217613
we should consider on principle whether there is any point at all in holding these kinds of meetings .    3.5360947683298067
i have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform .    3.8049688963073085
we can just as easily find out what happened from the newspapers .    3.195798492848396
that would be more productive and i do not like seeing the various committee agendas that are already UNK being cut again and again because of this kind of show - piece .    3.904129313849692
so i think we should consider simply abolishing these meetings once and for all .    2.9681688281755836
mr bösch , i take note of your observation but , clearly , we hold this type of conference of presidents , open to all meps at the original request of the meps , so that they may participate in some of them .    4.140054251740129
surely we should be more selective .    4.331034826074916
in any event , the bureau will consider your suggestion .    2.653500974663969
( the minutes were approved )    1.9577163372853157
vote    3.0905809937555753
mr president , we should like to request that the last sentence of amendment no 2 which reads : ' also calls on the member states to promote tourism for the elderly ' be incorporated into paragraph 25 , which deals specifically with social tourism , after : ' tourism for organised social groups . ' .    3.639687763275527
we think its inclusion there would be both more appropriate and more effective .    3.250330725425111
mr president , the subsidiarity principle is one of the fundamental principles underlying cooperation in the european union .    3.3456350540267374
it is high time it was properly evaluated and that a system was set up which clearly identifies the eu ' s areas of competence .    3.336374355661225
a criticism which is often levelled at the eu and which , to some extent , is justified is that it is involved in far too many areas .    4.811670605535929
one such area is tourism which , by its very nature , is very much a national concern .    3.5225296059477778
in so far as tourism falls within the political domain , it should be at national , regional and local level .    3.365299683333088
tourism is a major source of employment and has a role to play as regards the eu ' s financial support for less well - off regions .    4.277954895415289
even in that respect , any cooperation should , however , be carried out according to the subsidiarity principle .    4.300863246643115
because tourism can also have a harmful impact on the environment , there needs to be a strategy for damage limitation .    4.326924923488941
however , such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy .    3.6618886866058493
the report UNK the lack of a legal basis for a policy on tourism .    3.94849635414383
. ( da ) tourism is a significant source of international understanding and an important part of the labour market , which ought to be promoted and encouraged .    3.8769367993026065
it is of inestimable importance that people in europe , as well as in the rest of the world , should have the opportunity to experience each other ' s ways of UNK their lives and their societies .    3.7911998823529056
policy on tourism is not , however , something which ought to be planned and decided upon by the european parliament or by the eu as a whole .    5.117962684639432
i am therefore voting against the proposal .    3.3111798926796157
mr president , before we begin our discussion , as an italian mep - and i believe i also speak on behalf of all italian meps - i should like to condemn the position taken yesterday by the german chancellor , who UNK in italian internal affairs , when he threatened that europe would intervene if any neo - fascists became members of the government .    3.9025943161248224
fortunately , the italian government and the president of the republic intervened , and today the italian ambassador to germany will also speak on the subject , to call on the german chancellor not to interfere in italian internal affairs , in so far as there are no neo - fascist candidates for government office .    3.4710101457365368
we would like to thank the president of the republic , as well as the government and all the politicians who spoke and we too , in this house , would also call on the german chancellor not to intervene in italian internal affairs .    3.896420314236131
mr UNK will accept that it is a little difficult to understand the relationship between his intervention and the points of order , but i understand his political meaning .    4.729022422875111
we will proceed to the debate itself and mr monti will take the floor on behalf of the commission .    3.4601470816914817
european postal services    4.750302610414522
the next item is the debate on the oral question ( b5 - 0010 / 2000 ) tabled by mr hatzidakis , on behalf of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , to the commission , on european postal services .    2.97142348149076
mr president , the commission ' s proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the commission and the fact that the new commission needs to re - examine the issues involved .    3.49316865789579
with regard to parliament ' s various resolutions on the postal sector , my colleague , commissioner bolkestein , has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which parliament held last year .    4.0276405306771546
the studies were sent to the committee and to the meps who requested them , in september 1999 and are , in any case , still available .    4.171590476935484
they can also be consulted on the commission ' s internet website .    3.7745189928125478
i am sure commissioner bolkestein will listen carefully to all parliament ' s comments .    3.7011940091362954
the commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector .    3.8635371777448584
furthermore , the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation .    3.4146562465369956
i can confirm that it is commissioner bolkestein ' s firm intention to present a proposal to the commission by the middle of the year , to be forwarded to parliament and the council .    4.656871002156326
the date set for completing the next phase , which the commission intends to keep to , is 1 january 2003 .    3.8965525177181677
the proposal will take account of the studies and , in particular , the need to maintain a universal service , to develop efficient safeguards for consumers , to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition .    3.3148064757001703
the role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole .    3.865136285244053
the proposal , when it is put forward , will take account of the points of view of member states , parliament , users , universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties , all of whom have been involved in an in - depth consultation process .    4.1460551504158145
the aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the european union .    3.5550425333245186
mr president , the postal sector continues to be an area in which old , outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition .    3.6344188311929813
and , in the absence of any energetic action by the commission , the situation has gone on for far too long .    3.9222744302372132
the eu ' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas , but not in the postal sector .    3.672603211992499
we have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the commission to put forward proposals , so i should be grateful if the commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new , modern europe - wide postal system .    3.7412136579685513
one of the eu ' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market .    3.9116369451889645
we are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more member states .    2.7780771751602527
that requires greater efficiency which , in turn , is dependent on competition .    3.4297493196539115
today , one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation , an exercise in which the eu often leads the way , while the commission ' s determination to make progress serves as a model .    3.8732785467615782
the commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects .    3.1765161796578556
it is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and , moreover , because it will lead to lower prices . all that , we are assured , will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market .    4.228046236825534
it has been done in a number of different areas but , unfortunately , the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now .    3.9451380705227597
it can hardly be because customers are satisfied .    3.075424168825373
we are all familiar with the much - criticised price UNK , and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion .    3.1246292230873496
if we really want a functioning internal market , we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services .    3.5086561543371433
a number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services .    3.4472521311114264
the netherlands , finland and sweden have travelled UNK along this road .    3.0753192413049084
moreover , sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus .    3.215609438978976
the process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement .    3.7769890796277656
experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which , as customers , we are all entitled to expect .    3.892446505175793
prior to this discussion , a letter was sent out by UNK of the old monopolies .    5.102411007206424
they hold up sweden as a warning , which might be appropriate in certain instances , but not as regards postal services .    3.664039590612916
it is alleged in a UNK that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993 .    3.544660837581855
that is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where , in practice , there is still a monopoly , that is where the state is the only player .    4.236560641744858
however , for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market , prices have fallen .    4.019816075546352
that shows that competition really is working .    3.3999862710894138
my conclusion is therefore : make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market , too .    4.086505633704573
it is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for .    3.60449488706864
( the speaker is interrupted by mr markov ) i thought i had the floor .    3.1906605972723145
perhaps we can discuss this later on .    3.020649085230104
however , i should like to affirm that it is exactly as i said , namely , that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition , whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly .    4.017261800777706
that is why i should now like to see a commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector .    3.6111597309145065
mr markov , in five or six minutes time , you will be allowed a few minutes to speak .    3.747602261099351
i would be grateful if you would not interrupt other members .    2.9131932180259685
mr president , there is a mystery .    3.0871574717714947
what happened to the postal services directive that was passed on 15 december 1997 ?    3.07416044216715
there has been a deafening silence from the commission during the period between then and now .    3.5314573250655035
i am sorry it is commissioner monti who is here today .    3.044982005674671
i am very fond of him .    2.7849261402883445
he is one of the more UNK and hard working commissioners .    4.4107380486852605
it is a pity i cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues .    3.7209660182990962
there has , over this period , been no real progress on the postal services directive .    3.6837911506920427
commissioner monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties .    3.722151496053794
that has only happened recently .    3.290885913663685
for over a year the old commission could have done some work on this .    3.956406547264289
we really have not progressed very far .    3.454063720820974
however , since commissioner monti is here , i would like him to take a message back to commissioner bolkestein telling him what the postal services directive was about .    4.006314683566281
it was about gradual liberalisation ; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price ; it was about direct mail and cross - border mail remaining in the reserved sector .    2.9600756495798906
these issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive .    3.4785553864340955
the postal service is not just for christmas .    3.7590750519498655
it is for life .    3.1127387476781783
in the area in scotland i come from it is much more than just a postal service .    3.776428913125374
it is about keeping communities together .    2.972201295641258
the postal service is also the social service .    3.0270530862136877
the postal service is also the doctor .    3.11028773561044
if we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade .    3.5540645325575353
we will cut them off .    3.132814756759026
the postal services are important .    3.3748081043828684
that message must be taken back from here today .    3.8948250188803177
the commission must listen to it .    2.998655882992795
mr president , we are in favour of liberalising the union ' s postal services .    3.596752894201884
this should first of all stand for better service .    3.941604864882673
this is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal .    3.2083309906082866
liberalisation began because there was doubt regarding the structure of the postal services and the value of a monopoly .    3.693105071905005
is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where the customer ' s requirements and the market situation can change very rapidly , because , for example , the use of electronic data carriers has increased dramatically ?    3.780663893648643
the question is , therefore : what are the demands that a monopoly or part of a service which is governed by a monopoly needs to meet ?    3.621956316791686
most member states have been putting the UNK on , and i am pleased to note that , in my country , the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago , and that the belgian postal services and the belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition .    5.038845626546811
as you can see , as a new mep , i am trying to get to grips with the dossier and i must admit that i have great difficulty doing so .    3.8215881059467858
i have found a number of studies which were commissioned by the european commission at the time , and i am also coming across documents from post - europe which claims that these studies are inaccurate and that the basis on which these were carried out is incorrect .    4.267548050572945
i think that the commission could have been more pro - active on this score and could have also provided us with the studies which it had promised to give us and which we had requested .    3.6862010506062495
as far as i know , that has still not happened .    3.538714488945939
i would therefore ask you , commissioner , to help me in my task as a new member .    3.5198076377483862
like mr miller , i would welcome an explanation from you regarding the implementation of the 1997 directive within the next couple of months or weeks or , if at all possible , within the next couple of days .    3.750684969911565
my second point concerns the universal provision of services . what is happening on this score , how much does it cost , how does it work , how do you intend to organise it and what proposals do you have ?    3.35352283745293
i would welcome more concrete information on this .    3.216223006569965
apparently , the postal service is a very strong lobby and rightly so .    3.498777741509471
there are hundreds of thousands of people who earn their living at the post office .    2.8659289555148515
moreover - and mr miller has already pointed this out - it will surely not be the end of the world if the postman no longer comes round , even in my country , however densely populated it may be .    4.406638771202008
but in belgium too , there are a great number of people , older people for example , who only see one other person in the day and that is the postman .    4.932851475190428
we should not overlook this fact : postal service is about more than just UNK around letters and parcels .    3.3581652803633317
the postal service is also extremely important to companies .    2.93311213686363
a study has shown that 90 % of the postal traffic is between companies and only 10 % between individuals .    3.9456293927188697
what exactly do you intend to liberalise ?    3.8569540003403406
i would like more information on this , because the key question is how you can better serve the customer using the existing services .    3.996864878509363
there are postal companies which have a monopoly and are doing a reasonably good job .    3.5902097164614006
we need to protect this type of arrangement and denounce other things .    3.3420843235355484
mr president , commissioner , this morning on french national radio , i heard that liberalisation of the french postal service was now only a matter of days or hours away and that it was irreparable , like the developments with our neighbours in sweden , the netherlands and germany .    3.5473847275229335
this concerns us deeply and that is why we requested this debate today .    4.016996575663045
the commission is committed to a universal postal service , as the european parliament has shown on several occasions , the postal service is actually , as some speakers have already mentioned , a key factor in social and territorial cohesion .    3.7678482590695017
in this connection i should like to ask one of our swedish meps for an opinion of the study which has been carried out and which shows that in fact in the most remote areas of sweden the postal service was rather poor in terms of distribution .    4.372944330567993
that is not the sort of postal service that we want .    3.8210886307703547
the economic value of the postal service was recognised by the treaty of amsterdam and we consider that it goes far beyond the distribution of mail .    3.8928016910358796
it is the service which remains closest to the citizens and which we call a ' public service ' , which makes it possible for everyone resident within european territory to receive the service , and this entitlement must remain an acquired right , an acquis communautaire .    3.7203562218703508
the matter of the european union ' s recognition of a high - quality postal service , available to all , remains valid today , and we are increasingly concerned .    4.309717625204447
that is why today we are asking not to have any nasty UNK in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism come monday .    3.6255659418305064
well , we are not convinced that the studies currently available make it possible to implement this liberalisation right now and we are concerned because it is well known that liberalisation without impact studies would cause thousands of job losses , something we certainly do not want .    4.063518316468528
we value our public service , our universal postal service , because we know , and here too we are acting as representatives of the citizens , that the citizens value this service and the commission undertook , during mr bolkestein ' s hearing , to maintain this universal service throughout the european union .    4.003361040485583
i shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing , i think we all still remember them .    3.4496778932244765
we further maintain that we are waiting for this proper evaluation before any definitive decision , as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive .    3.797107016503748
we shall not accept a date for the liberalisation of all activities in the postal sector until the commission has offered us a guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the public postal service will be maintained in the states which consider this service essential to the citizen .    4.222561816132834
mr president , i share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost - effectiveness of the services offered .    3.558398861347125
but as an entrepreneur myself , i really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of " privatisation " and " liberalisation " !    3.6010918923937076
or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all , but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large UNK .    4.113661280489638
members should however represent all the citizens , which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy .    4.492574259852271
in practice that means the following for the postal services : firstly , priority must be given to employment .    4.1317635433334345
secondly , we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services .    3.4220019741841337
examples in germany and sweden show that this certainly is a risk .    3.8059030967174903
mr stenmarck , sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other member states of the european union .    3.6395077798279787
so that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent .    4.164652629123472
thirdly , it is vital to have , first of all , a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens , wherever they may be ; secondly , to have a uniform price for all member states ; and thirdly , to have daily mail deliveries and UNK on working days .    4.108533396658381
on the question of the cost - effectiveness of the various postage UNK , it is worth considering further price cuts ; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying .    4.1662320305323925
we do not have to adhere to a weight of over UNK when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of UNK to make it at all worthwhile .    3.9514760535342766
in that respect i believe it was right and important to hold this debate today , to make mr bolkestein aware of parliament ' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset .    4.0279067661608705
mr president , the 1997 directive , issued on 21 january 1998 , which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in europe , envisaged a revision at a later date , in a rather convoluted manner , indeed , since it was to be dealt with in a commission proposal by the end of 1998 , then decided by 1 january 2000 , to come into force finally by 1 january 2003 .    3.779356302621551
well , for the time being , the revision has not got off the starting block .    3.3420907872092056
the two initial phases were not observed which , logically , ought to compromise the third .    2.9104801304242898
my first question is this : surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case ?    3.340253213616747
apparently , they were .    3.815995653907503
it is really not possible to see how the commission could by the end of 1998 , as stipulated by article 7 of the directive , have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in february of the same year .    4.382545106905094
moreover , the commission was also not able to provide the implementation report which , according to article 23 , it was to submit by 31 december 2000 .    4.415232240845262
should we complain about this delay ?    3.1439449719256216
we do not think so .    2.7035517044712707
if the commission actually did have convincing evidence in support of taking liberalisation forwards , no one doubts that it would present it without delay .    3.442420691984082
for its part , the european parliament , which had fought hard to ensure that the 1997 directive was balanced and respected the requirements of a universal public service , is rather satisfied to see that the compromise it obtained then is proving to be UNK .    3.6281670528264196
in these circumstances , it is quite reasonable for this house to express concern today , asking an oral question which urges the commission to show the definite and unquestionable feasibility studies which to date no one has seen .    3.799797122554831
what are the scenarios for development and the potential risks ?    3.7203835660048035
today , following the 1997 compromise , member states can give public monopolies responsibility for the postal service involving mail and parcels whose distribution cost is less than five times the basic tariff , with a weight of less than 350 grammes .    3.7994836591561865
it may be supposed , for example , as commissioner bolkestein gave us to understand during his hearing on 6 september last year , that the commission might propose reducing these limits to 50 UNK and two and a half times the basic tariff .    3.5071479191387316
this solution would not , in our opinion , be a fair one and indeed the commission would have no UNK figures to support it .    4.398715279980582
but , unfortunately , we are aware since seattle that the commission has no need of a proper assessment of the previous stage before proposing that we go rapidly on to the next stage .    4.47234941856642
the second scenario , which we prefer : to defer the revision and maintain the current situation until such time as we do actually have a proper , detailed objective study of the effects of the 1997 directive .    3.7760677574103045
in saying that , we are not seeking to protect monopolies whose pernicious effects we are already familiar with , but we wish to be certain that it is possible to combine the gradual evolution of the organisations with maintaining the key principles of public service .    4.081905863870219
finally , the union for a europe of nations group wonders if the idea of UNK unified management rules on the postal services of the fifteen member states might not be , essentially , UNK .    3.359080178977309
in france , for example , the unequal distribution of the population over a vast territorial area makes the obligation to provide a public service absolutely indispensable in mail distribution if one wishes to maintain the equality of citizens and social cohesion .    3.445833981818058
but other countries , in other situations , may have alternative analyses .    4.624960958589984
in our opinion , each one must be free to make its own organisational choices .    3.24397548740143
in fact , article 86 of the ec treaty , formerly article 90 , stipulates that services of general economic interest are subject to the rules on competition only insofar as the application of such rules does not obstruct the performance of the particular tasks assigned to them .    3.065905333167127
but who defines these tasks ?    3.4659419053786165
who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised ?    3.1922800856971514
our answer is clear : it is not the commission nor even the council or the european parliament , but the people of each member state by democratic procedures .    5.22328878170897
to wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions .    4.2800341761176846
mr president , we are currently in the first phase of transposition of directive 97 / 67 / UNK on postal services and i am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered .    3.8582703705786257
during mr bolkestein ' s hearing , my colleague UNK UNK asked for an undertaking " that any new proposals , once these are known , should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted . "    3.5243033786822697
what has become of it ?    3.4025455827664666
do we have the results of this impact study ?    4.234457302954652
as you know , we members of the edd group , are in favour , along with others , of rural life , maintaining employment , and social cohesion in rural areas , a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service .    3.919500272628597
most assuredly i would like to be able to say that the examples i observe every day in my own country and in my own region , a very rural one , convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation .    4.406747460853277
unfortunately , this is not the case and currently , by merging the start of the application of the european directive and the application of the 35 - hour law , which is purely french , but also by changing the working time criteria , such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per UNK as opposed to 1 400 , as previously , in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed .    3.85937585591938
this is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service .    3.4568245739898233
i have here the local paper for my municipality , which reads , " the manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 january 2000 " - you can see how topical this is - " the last collection will take place at 3 . 45 p . m . instead of at 4 . 30 p . m . as at present . "    3.6091835109356163
so you can appreciate why i am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation , and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation .    3.757530580507483
as you know , in our country , each village has its own local post office or at least a post box , with a collection every day .    3.8055296344086753
the postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents .    4.01113902332007
so he delivers money too , and sometimes even medicines , thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home .    3.4757968942332624
if postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way , more post offices will be closed , in the name of this UNK profitability , which is often the cause of rural regression .    4.065164715115675
once again , europe is UNK itself from its poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants .    3.5635010491598686
they will be told that they are too expensive , without drawing any comparison with other social services such as police and health services but also sports and cultural services , where lack of profitability is scarcely admitted in urban areas .    3.0439220982687893
everyone is free to choose their UNK .    2.9316021281284623
they should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment .    3.7560040319225503
in sport the saying goes , " do not change a winning team . "    3.205535270976365
why should we wish to change a system which is satisfactory ?    3.8688145026689114
the universal service will be able to fulfil its social mission only if it retains an area of monopoly enabling it to balance its budget .    3.7237002627408744
we cannot afford to make a mistake , for we know for a fact that we shall not be able to turn the clock back and that in the event of an imbalance , the firm will know how to tackle it : jobs will be lost , services will be reduced , the dead wood will be removed and we already know which areas will be considered dead wood .    3.92560557026013
we are told we should change the limit from 350 grammes to 150 grammes , or even 50 grammes .    2.9785065203217123
so be it . but the 200 grammes that make up the difference will be seized upon by many private and therefore profitable bodies .    3.1926675044729795
so , once again , why not leave things as they are and allow the public service to fund itself and to guarantee the annual excess cost of its operations in the public interest , UNK in france , by UNK UNK , as it happens , at ff 8 billion ?    4.464054450277309
if revenue is lost , then public interest operations will be revised and cut , and again it is in rural areas that the most UNK cuts will be made .    4.002050277341632
what we should do now , i feel , is wait , particularly until we know the economic and social impact of one phase of liberalisation before taking the risk of destabilising an entire section of our universal public service , which many of our fellow citizens still value highly .    3.9546407094683715
mr president , i am one of those who agree that it is appropriate that this particular service should be regulated at european level .    3.5614651011153997
if people are to be free to provide services across borders it is only fair and reasonable that we should have european regulations to govern it .    4.105533889826614
in ireland some services are provided by companies from outside ireland , for example , english companies certainly operate there .    3.475577053236321
but this directive has never been transposed into national law .    3.379497837709423
it is the job of the commission to ensure that national governments take account of their legal obligations under european law and transpose european directives .    4.311612945229131
that has not been done in ireland although a certain liberalisation has taken place and has not been UNK by the national government .    4.266413619531918
a small segment of our market has been taken over by private operators .    3.400220324239504
but the need for common legislation is underlined by the fact that in the netherlands they have liberalised , in germany they have not , yet german companies which enjoy the protection of national law seek to take market share in the netherlands .    4.0411013544966154
this is another example of the importance of moving forward with common legislation and ensuring that it is put into effect throughout the union .    4.085135937164798
i come from a rural area .    2.571724930795925
i support the principle of liberalising and the right of everybody to compete and i recognise the benefits that common regulation and liberalisation has brought over the years .    3.6298308582547834
for example it has enabled us to fly from peripheral parts of the european union to the centre for a fraction of the cost of 20 years ago .    3.688034917727072
we allowed it and the result is that our young people can travel and broaden their education .    3.4054342295919846
so liberalisation has taken a lot of UNK off our back in many areas and enabled many people to enjoy higher standards of living .    3.5105679432834003
on the other hand this is not a free market without limits and if you come from a rural area you recognise that some services in the free market situation cannot and will not be provided .    3.66180869737771
so , the commission , in bringing forward their new proposals , must remember those sparsely populated rural areas and not put anything in this legislation which will deprive those areas of the opportunities of having those services .    3.646932537910905
in rural areas , for many years , even before the irish free state came into existence , we sometimes had this service of a post office .    3.4571221988176917
today , it is probably the only public service in many remote areas and people are concerned that european legislation will eventually make it difficult to maintain it .    3.8722010545831727
i want to underline the fact that the existing legislation protects rather than threatens the right of every citizen in every remote area to have this service .    3.7097187776180247
but complaints are made by private individuals about social welfare being paid in the post offices in ireland .    3.3153763445668556
i want the commission to recognise that this is a necessary social service .    4.458783760232912
it should go hand in hand with our postal services in rural areas .    3.1497641506106966
we must implement what the directive insists on , that the postal service is available to everybody .    4.26398170728831
mr president , commissioner , besides the fact that the postal services doubtless play an extremely important part in providing employment , they are very helpful in the effort to achieve the cohesion we all want so much and which is a basic reason for the european union ' s existence .    4.55579302605499
as is known , the commission should already , before the end of 1998 , have tabled new proposals for a revision of the postal services directive 97 / 67 , guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service , securing its economic viability , and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved , including postal workers and customers .    3.542672805103707
to that end , the commission has commissioned studies on the cost of universal services , the consequences of liberalising cross - border mail and direct mail , the consequences of reducing weight and cost limits in the reserved sector , the consequences of liberalising the other phases of the postal process , excluding distribution , and an overall appraisal of the results of those studies .    3.944989584360489
mr president , we are therefore wondering , and we ask the commission - although , of course , mr bolkestein is not here , but mr monti is a man of many parts and i think he may have a view on this : should those studies not examine the economic and social impact of the various liberalisation scenarios envisaged on each , and i repeat , on each one of the european union ' s member states ?    4.526808365950867
the postal services in greece , great britain , the netherlands or belgium are , of course , all different .    3.8284870919972964
with liberalisation , how will it be possible for the universal postal service to be funded and to operate correctly in a country such as my own , greece , with its particular geographical features and its numerous , small but inhabited islands ?    3.6587522194227793
how can a universal service provider in my country survive with the liberalisation of cross - border mail which amounts to approximately 25 % , as opposed to less than 5 % in other countries ?    3.6980102117189033
how are we to deal with the transfer of the national post office ' s business abroad ?    3.6744541134883706
we have just heard mr UNK on the subject .    3.532772593999215
it will most certainly be necessary , we say , because of the technological developments that simplify this transfer and thereby make it more profitable , to determine the further gradual and controlled liberalisation by setting weight and price limits .    3.479434696378023
but what will those limits be ?    3.097861057002263
are we UNK to grant ' UNK ' enterprises the right to operate UNK and therefore circumvent the weight limit very easily since the content of letters cannot , of course , be checked ?    3.767536721070191
in any event , we ask the commission to lay its cards on the table and put forward its proposals , having examined the ultimate foreseeable development of the matter from every aspect and for all the member states .    3.340956283687962
it is self - evident that liberalisation is not an end in itself , but only a means towards improving services .    2.969906685325661
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the planned liberalisation of the traditional national postal services raises the inevitable question as to what the postal services will consider their core business to be in the future . in other words , what will the postal services be prepared to do themselves , what will they want to do together in international cooperation and what will they no longer provide ?    3.7947790795674465
this question should be answered in light of the fact that the age - old monopoly has de facto been undermined by all kinds of UNK companies and by technological developments , such as fax and e - mail .    3.4359469824686313
but then again , the central theme of the liberalisation of the postal services is employment .    3.5252777206038197
past experiences have sufficiently shown that early retirement schemes and voluntary redundancy schemes often have an UNK effect .    3.0664515246634183
i would remind you of the fact that the belgian telephone company had to recall employees who had been sent into retirement in order to prevent too much know - how and expertise from disappearing from the company .    3.216494940203805
once again , the point of discussion in the liberalisation of the postal services will no doubt be a reduction in the workforce .    3.576522058782739
one should , however , be very aware of the fact that if people are encouraged to apply for voluntary redundancy , the company will primarily lose those people who already work under pressure or who can easily find employment elsewhere , in other words , they are often the people which the company in question needs .    3.85093020670554
in my opinion , it would be a sign of well - thought - out human resource management if the commission were to share a number of these concerns , so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions .    3.74091480606117
mr president , postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in parliament at the moment and rightly so , given their importance .    3.8583262369799805
only last week , in the uk parliament at westminster the newly - elected mp from our european free alliance partners , UNK UNK , the party of wales , made his maiden speech on that subject .    4.051450122499662
the scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices , especially in rural areas , play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities .    3.696468378090036
liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services .    3.8173191244051545
post office outlets in scotland , as we have heard , handle much more than just mail delivery .    3.866077070490089
traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house UNK , local taxes and so on . but as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts , so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened .    3.513192224300273
if a rural post office UNK , usually with the only local shop attached , then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result .    2.9984350210479467
instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems , governments , and the commission too , should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon , providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents .    3.5913231917931507
mr president , the task of the post office is to ensure that , every day , the post is delivered everywhere , be it in the city or in remote , rural areas , at the same tariff .    3.7909884055664964
for 150 years , the postal services have been a public affair and , as such , just like public transport and the power supply , a core task of the national governments .    4.873417155965022
such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote .    3.1015080885474875
they are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs .    3.34718291005943
i once heard a christian democratic politician make the following comment in a dutch village : " the postal service belongs to us all ; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft " .    3.445976092366503
the existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors .    3.703221945262727
the UNK are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices .    3.442680032232454
such companies have always been around , but they used to be banned , whereas these days they are being heralded as progress .    3.8490497819626386
the end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices .    3.6873120092777425
they will get their workforce to do more work at lower wages .    3.2824872956692324
they will often do fewer home deliveries , charge more for retaining post during the holidays , close down a large number of the post office branches and , ultimately , the tariffs for the individual will sharply increase , at which point the only parties which will stand to benefit from this type of practice will be companies which conclude collective agreements at a lower tariff .    3.1094741855072625
it is time we stopped this trend .    3.044475343932147
a fault UNK is half UNK .    3.3058168924076927
we are better off with one democratically controlled monopoly than the waste and chaos brought on by competition which cannot be controlled .    3.060625751300103
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , people used to be UNK to demonstrations by letter or telegram ; nowadays this is done by e - mail and via websites !    2.9397030646338
i also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service .    3.2376027816379334
we know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1 . 2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market .    3.8227928342709823
i believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular , which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures .    3.8572366193314664
of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage , because they are so densely distributed throughout europe .    3.2489247673055313
even the UNK village has a post office and in future e - commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e - mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means . that is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important .    3.3064240019977054
the collection , sorting , transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension .    3.296537164083462
i believe that in future we must seize this opportunity .    2.913998993421135
as politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests .    3.2790431030417175
we want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid .    3.4291028551836127
we should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector .    2.864717191908552
this transparency is also very important for the unions , for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service ?    3.044168831342623
i think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice , fairness and solidarity .    3.3036171779874164
we should define the universal service precisely , establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender .    2.980154505106892
in rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost - effective , i believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent UNK conditions , so that all the market forces , and of course the existing postal services too , can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies .    3.9222895529469013
i believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system .    3.4228900736740484
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , postal services , just like any european public service , contribute to the social cohesion of community territory under the terms of article 16 of the treaty of amsterdam .    3.3285509480746738
by UNK tariffs , i . e . treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service , by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service , while complying with the requirement for quality of service , postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them .    3.7371322593795986
they also play a major role in maintaining links between people .    3.1939412419703377
as has been pointed out here on many occasions , is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in UNK districts or divided communities , whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities ?    3.6263653170388106
let me cite the example of the initiative of the french postal service , which decided , for instance , to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas .    3.795960085106503
without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors , european public postal services today employ one and a half million UNK whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical , untrammelled liberalisation .    2.9120344830558045
the european parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs .    2.9317608109105
we may congratulate ourselves on this , but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the european parliament is today being excluded from the main decision - making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in europe .    4.344199944557235
indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 january 1999 .    4.805437834527062
that resolution called for the european parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved .    3.488415912781787
these impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation , not just on the economic organisation of the market , but also in terms of its human and social aspects .    4.566799313299371
the delays in the commission ' s work will inevitably have a knock - on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question .    3.572089398319056
by defining a sector reserved for public postal services , on the basis of weight and price limits , the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases .    3.7268484727527484
the sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services .    3.351793728016156
against a background of globalisation , where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion , we must here , as a matter of urgency , reiterate our commitment to european public service , whether it be , today , the postal service or , tomorrow , the rail service or , the day after that , the health service .    4.497995824653535
mr president , i rise as other scottish members of this house , representatives of scotland , to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts .    3.3238448158541822
the postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout europe and not least in scotland .    3.69752429587242
it would be a disaster if action were deliberately , or even UNK , taken which had the effect of damaging that .    3.341325009108987
i do not believe that it is anybody ' s intention to do so .    2.9926713475189324
i do not believe that the commission has set out to make war upon the islands of scotland or greece .    3.5022683722596346
but they might UNK do great damage .    3.312215829194594
the point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place .    3.086378639395137
if too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service , it would become UNK to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate .    3.735966505926522
the critical thing is to balance universality and affordability .    3.3516246174040814
the message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the house to the commission today is that the commission should tread UNK .    4.238753463656738
the commission should not , for example , take a UNK jump from 350 grammes to , as some have suggested , as low as 50 grammes .    3.4783920169119598
on the contrary , it should proceed cautiously .    3.0773016282242076
i imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances .    3.276069808611848
the solidarity and cohesion of people all over europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else , at an affordable stamp price .    3.6896296065203584
mr president , the only way to guarantee a high - quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service .    3.3644627073615365
a universal service offering high - quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform UNK tariff .    3.6882831790675734
this service must therefore be kept public .    4.176173236840872
this is the only way to guarantee that the network , from collection to distribution , will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators .    3.4154423541242105
however , further to the directive on common rules for community postal services , the commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the european parliament . we are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive ' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current european postal operators in terms of both economics and employment .    4.67171141972283
in our opinion , the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted , including its timetable .    3.738067872429831
any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications , with the objective always being to guarantee a high - quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs .    3.8001397807310364
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker ' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service , is not a contradiction in terms .    3.745653697376824
i think ours is a different approach !    3.41099952294716
european policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy , telecommunications and air transport - and the target , the focus , was always the consumer .    3.3946008950836606
the aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services .    3.6529271875947904
i think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs .    2.9641490214642525
the postal market is UNK along behind and , sadly , we have wasted valuable time here .    3.7054451392379577
i believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends .    3.615099760443419
that will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges ; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges .    3.594794915252405
i believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market .    3.34194315075358
it also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of european policy .    2.856969841587033
we should seize that opportunity , for the citizen keeps asking , why do we have europe ?    3.8590191238084794
these are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of europe .    3.284198472267494
i am glad mr monti , the commissioner for competition , is here today in person , for he is pursuing an excellent policy .    3.667352914043399
and here i want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - parliament and the commission must consider where to draw limits to competition .    5.264463139468179
we are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy , and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible .    4.110116549636018
yet i believe that , as this debate has shown , we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas .    4.988582522951803
so i would ask you to give an impetus in that direction , together with parliament .    3.8439410423974008
i have mentioned the example of social services before : nowadays we can reduce everything to attracting the customer , including the pensioner in an old people ' s home , and the question is whether we want to subject all that to competition , whether that is the right course .    4.295689744108329
i believe we should use this legislative term to determine the limits , the positive aspects of competition .    3.2443529615946254
for competition is not an end in itself ; it is there to serve of the citizen , the consumer , which is why we should consider the areas in which we do not want it .    4.307028790437071
mr president , liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public ; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology .    3.1665804628415843
i emphasise the word ' could ' , and that is if it is done well and with care .    4.269477228907601
wrongly done , the threatening UNK that have been described here will certainly become a reality .    3.81522511271753
social problems will increase , interregional disparities will grow , and competition will occur only in those areas where the economy is strongest , areas where there are more people and , especially , more businesses .    3.755005571625025
on the other hand , the UNK will be the remote areas and their inhabitants , and the people that will not benefit from the new services .    4.289657224398068
before we decide whether to liberalise postal services , there should be much more discussion about how we can make the present services more flexible and more customer - friendly , and how funding systems can facilitate the investments called for by the new technology .    3.7156966085642495
i think this policy has been reasonably successful in finland , as UNK by the present public system .    3.608869435325559
i think , however , that common rules have to be applied to this sector , so that we do not find ourselves at some stage somewhere out in the wild west , or even the wild east . we need rules in common based on equality and the principle of a public service .    4.09677568634963
mr president , a precise assessment of the effects of the first directive is the least we can ask for when approaching the future of the public postal service .    3.9772859535606577
it would be UNK to wish to settle the fate of hundreds of thousands of postal workers , millions of service users , in a great rush .    3.5600051200125855
but , despite the unfavourable opinion of ten european postal services , a form of UNK privatisation is UNK in the corridors of the commission .    3.8407394429897477
by lowering the price / weight threshold reserved for public postal services and by liberalising UNK or cross - border post , the second directive may offer the most profitable sectors to the competitive sector .    3.3353268199422503
postal services may then keep whatever does not UNK the appetite of the private operators .    3.339038763916906
whether total or partial , privatisation will only make an already dismal situation worse .    3.0269657252983646
just the example of the privatisation of british rail services should suffice to prove the extent to which UNK for maximum profit is UNK to maintaining a socially useful service .    3.4366769029268918
one example of this slow progress is the way the commission is proceeding .    4.303593185877447
this study is taking far too long and we feel it is important to speed up the pace at last .    3.993008230439115
i am most grateful to the commissioner for his plain talking today and i would ask the commission to force the pace now .    4.1282662630284275
today ' s debate makes it quite clear that parliament wants more emphasis on speed , not speed at the expense of quality , but then UNK alone does not mean quality either .    3.5607741852903714
this brings me to my second point , namely the snail as symbol of our postal services .    3.1444297524911535
what has happened over the past 200 years is that the time it takes for a letter to go from munich to brussels has increased fivefold .    3.7722454715114866
letters to strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner , but it still takes far too long .    3.7707460969142206
that means that since the days of mail - coaches and UNK , we have seen a steady decline in the quality of services .    3.454647417058616
it may be true , as was said here , that today we have new possibilities , e . g . electronic possibilities such as e - mail , but on the other hand we must realise that as ever the ordinary letter continues to play a very , very important role and that , in particular , young families , the elderly and many others continue to rely very heavily on conventional mail .    3.675360566851558
so i believe that in relation to conventional mail we must do what mr radwan described in such excellent terms , namely encourage competition on the one hand and on the other , define the limits .    3.8247623510772875
but what we have often seen in recent years was the very opposite !    4.248350777853819
by embarking on the kind of pseudo and partial UNK we have also witnessed in germany , we have combined the drawbacks of the state monopoly with the drawbacks of privatisation , which is really not the purpose of the whole exercise !    4.343301360776006
they have referred to rural and sparsely populated areas .    3.156792637308742
i come from munich , a very densely populated urban UNK , but we have the same problem there .    4.062369702261511
one urban district post office after another is being closed down .    3.0398792992874597
we have a disproportionately large number of old people in these large cities , who are becoming increasingly UNK with the decline in the number of retail UNK .    4.170425870140388
that is why we must define certain minimum standards here too and realise that it is important to provide the necessary services for the people .    3.740890817796153
for if there is only one letter box left in the inner city of munich where the mail is collected again in the evening , that reflects a rapid decline in quality , while at the same time prices are sometimes rising , which is something else we must note .    3.487913813323204
so , yes to liberalisation , but let us also think about the limits to liberalisation , rapidly create reasonable conditions in europe and submit the appropriate study to the commission .    3.432500856052466
i would hope that in future the symbol of european postal policy will no longer be the snail but that our post will finally be UNK post - haste .    3.3023790002955598
that is a term that UNK back to the time when the post was still the symbol of speed .    3.643452424079426
like mr radwan , i am glad that commissioner monti is here rather than commissioner bolkestein because i believe that he can explain to us certain aspects relating to competition .    3.63229287997525
i do not know if mr monti is aware of the judgement of the court of justice of the european communities of last week , 10 february , which recognised the possibility of the german postal service being in a dominant position as a result of its holding a postal monopoly .    3.902507789043497
competition policy will no doubt have to be applied to this sector before the coming liberalisation - before 1 january 2003 - because at the moment the tendency is to divert mail via countries with lower postage rates .    3.5203634304762295
this has consequences for free competition between the different postal administrations .    3.546740737551138
in the event that liberalisation is brought about throughout the european union , what consequences would that have for free competition ?    3.5997298781000007
for the moment , it appears that , in the only country where liberalisation has taken place - sweden - there has been a 59 % increase in the price of postal services .    4.0789936084183855
we do not know what will happen in each of the countries where liberalisation is going to take place .    3.632458748238458
it is likely that postal liberalisation will lead to greater cost differences between countries , which will no doubt have implications for competition , which will not only affect the cost of the postal service but also the establishment of installations .    4.7724798994326845
for example , there are currently companies which set up in holland because the postal charges are lower than in germany and the same may happen in the future .    3.5204409711363494
at the moment , in services which are not theoretically liberalised - as is the case with national postal services - there is a basic form of liberalisation , which is agreed within the framework of the universal postal union , allowing for lower tariffs .    4.013148558570941
in a service which is theoretically liberalised , free competition may disappear as a result of the concentration of the service amongst large companies UNK their dominant position , agreements between companies and other similar circumstances .    3.323176128491207
i would therefore advise commissioner monti to deal with the issue of postal liberalisation , taking strict account of free competition , because i believe that this will probably become a very worrying issue in the future .    3.617911427292634
my prediction is that the liberalised postal services will probably be much less competitive than the current public postal services .    3.7414114094897672
mr president , the postal service is not a normal service provider like a UNK ' s or a UNK centre .    3.7448559855695818
for us in finland , a sparsely populated country , a visit to the post office is a social event .    3.4260436530025338
in the world of networking , the mail service is the most democratic of all networks .    3.7453542173680967
the common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the UNK .    4.111398833547906
for us in the north it will mean that the eu will be destroying the social infrastructure .    3.7638070315962167
commissioner monti , the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships : postal services must be improved , not run down .    3.669732275182012
only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone ' s reach in society .    2.977631258831617
the post office is democracy .    3.118808974479225
it is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies .    2.7462385423012683
democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office .    4.434352895656009
it is particularly appropriate that mr monti is responding to this debate because the great UNK with postal services is how to UNK an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all , even in the UNK and least inhabited region of the european union .    3.720761891439526
in the UNK and UNK of scotland and the rural borders and central belt , on the beautiful but fragile islands of the UNK , UNK and shetland , there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service .    4.200618546759332
yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services , like all service industries , are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open , even international , competition .    3.5877559263156353
i would suggest that there is a solution .    3.7673706365197543
air routes , UNK routes , train routes , bus routes , within and to these UNK areas are put out to tender . the bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract .    3.336571575536176
let us call this a negative tender franchise .    2.900920534462911
this permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly - supported but fully transparent franchise system .    2.856790274789426
why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner ?    3.269837058511051
the lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time .    3.3189757081322298
why could not the sub - post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender ?    3.299282920814548
it would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body , local , regional or national - probably under overall eu supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose .    3.56432046700272
otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace .    4.112188609081346
mr president , commissioner , it is no coincidence that i am the fifth member of this house from scotland to rise to speak in this debate .    3.596978430875005
that is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services .    3.687960806676873
scotland as a country is larger than some member states .    3.127888277531873
it has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road , sometimes served poorly by public transport , sometimes not at all .    3.088720580585215
such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities , such as a school , a post office and a shop .    3.2558326670078634
it is on the last two that the elderly , in particular , depend .    4.600118104872001
often they are located together , each service being made more viable by the existence of the other .    3.3562309484976867
scotland also has many island communities , some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea UNK .    3.856471909537802
it has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from edinburgh to the central highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across london .    2.9435889221890403
the more remote the community , the greater the difference becomes .    3.6090008518673757
it is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service .    3.515489386791262
it is for all our remote and island communities , no matter where in the european union they are situated , and not just for the people of scotland , that i ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide .    4.42143560074302
. mr president , i consider it a privilege that i am replacing my colleague , commissioner bolkestein , on the occasion of such a high - quality debate on postal services .    4.2143059134232255
i will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by commissioner bolkestein .    3.9119607320884526
may i repeat that on monday he will be available to the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism of parliament .    3.237624996188934
some members , like mr stenmarck , complain that there have been delays with the new proposal .    3.9871536488024875
others believe that it is not so bad after all , if there is a slight UNK after the first step of liberalisation .    4.64663227067222
this is , for example , the position expressed by mr berthu .    3.880457990878001
the commission ' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the commission , of which i am sure parliament is not totally unaware .    4.935594522301036
but we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made .    4.401521088132357
the scheduled date of 1 january 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible .    4.130006794439783
the proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service , to which i will come back in a second .    3.8807248558473555
as regards the existing directive and its implementation , most member states have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive .    3.5287278453249744
a number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence .    3.6297738158550485
the implementation deadline for the member states is january 2003 .    3.818152453884209
further liberalisation will occur afterwards .    3.4250624683987105
in some areas competition is already taking place , as in the parcels sector and in the express services .    3.926648752158112
the quality of services has , generally speaking , improved , in particular in regard to cross - border activity .    4.086606225095371
the quality of services , which is so relevant to consumers , was a main concern of all speakers , some of whom , like mr rübig , were very explicit on this point .    3.8720893156999905
the experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as sweden , finland and the netherlands , prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way , the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher - quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow - up .    3.671373501594381
so this is not a selling - out of the service and of its quality .    5.013493223053701
frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on - going standardisation of the UNK of the quality of service also contributes , as these standards will better reflect actual performance .    3.789046449313062
this will allow for meaningful UNK - marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent UNK as a result of the combined pressure by UNK , competitors and customers .    3.083865421084127
we can see in the incumbent operators , in public post offices , a change of culture that i believe nobody can consider negative if the current trend towards concentrating on customers ' needs continues .    3.3891595404437482
the concerns expressed in this parliament this morning by honourable members will be at the core of the activity of my colleague and of the commission as a whole in the preparation of the further proposal .    4.339758552954587
that proposal will fully take into account the need to ensure universality of service , the development of efficient safeguards for consumers , and the creation of a climate which would be favourable to new jobs - not to fewer jobs - in the framework of a progressive , gradual evolution .    4.132790765653194
we are all aware of the extremely important aspect of social and structural cohesion , especially in the sparsely populated rural areas , one of which has been particularly strongly and overwhelmingly represented in the debate this morning .    4.117754501908789
we believe that the universal service is a pillar and i am sure that my colleague will be able to provide reassurances to the appropriate parliamentary committee .    4.11257461450302
mrs UNK , but others like mr markov and mr UNK , voiced concerns about employment .    3.930599650444131
experience in other sectors show a sort of u - curve pattern : a phase of reduction in employment starts just before liberalisation takes place , as , of course , the incumbent prepares itself to be competitive ; then a second phase of steady employment , as new jobs in UNK operators balance further potential employment reductions ; finally , a third phase of net job creation , both in the incumbent and new operators as the benefits of liberalisation reach users and the market develops more quickly .    3.467196452866128
in the postal sector the first phase is already in progress , as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation .    4.145223593359219
the new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment .    3.8983405012098835
they have all been available on the commission ' s internet website since august 1999 and the commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested .    3.5017825100991886
the studies have been the object of some criticism , especially on the part of the public postal services .    3.886493461311517
i am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data .    3.091973961528136
this was no surprise , since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection .    3.607145918411906
does that not say a lot about management ability ?    3.6381596227915205
no single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties .    3.4775411694538447
nevertheless , mr bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision - making process .    3.0177287539756916
i finally come to three interventions about a subject i am supposed to know better than postal services , that is competition .    3.841477701531716
mr purvis , i found your UNK provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth UNK .    2.7729571564938635
mr medina ortega , i am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation , because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise , through UNK concentration , to private operators .    3.9305869960717237
this applies both to the post and other sectors .    3.283385643305054
if i can provide one example of this sort of vigilance , it is the case of deutsche post where , following complaints and an action before the court , the commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in july .    4.300978022766937
we have just received the reply of the german government to the observations made .    3.417149171828081
i will not go into the details due to lack of time , but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses .    3.6704320964524118
in a sense this is where its work begins .    3.7153930584807755
finally , mr radwan , of course , there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition .    3.9005696489650328
in particular , if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest , where a member state defines a mission of public service , it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition .    4.177205815325473
i would slightly disagree with the UNK you used when you said , mr radwan , that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition .    4.363357237419548
that concept i reject firmly , because competition is there for the citizens , and for them alone .    4.177033075271622
most companies UNK competition .    3.566796113035494
competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens , their economic interest and for their liberty .    3.746442238930673
the examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in UNK services in europe show that citizens have benefited from this .    3.262603686885796
thank you very much , commissioner .    1.894443415166077
pursuant to rule 42 ( 5 ) , i have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate .    3.8615178180063254
we shall now proceed to the vote .    1.8722281289198166
( parliament adopted the resolution ) explanations of vote    2.3656588137197114
we voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a french postal service trade union which was looking to obtain , in the event of a favourable vote , an additional time frame in which to defend employees .    3.5662208091741796
this does not mean that we approve the entire contents , which are too vague and which leave out the main concern .    3.404603007773286
the policy undertaken by the european institutions and by national governments , especially the french government , is a retrograde policy , counter to the interests of both the service users , i . e . the great majority of the population , and the postal service workers .    4.8893715154645365
postal services must continue to be public services .    3.845517850321314
all people , regardless of their location or social status , must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions .    4.252826883799808
in organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability , and private firms must not be authorised to UNK private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities .    3.90759005163367
consequently , the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of europe must keep their monopoly of this service .    3.4996007153242323
in order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the european union level , it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices , reducing the number of deliveries and UNK postal staff .    4.0300255160180365
the post office and , more generally , all public services must , on the other hand , recruit additional staff .    3.4394620560819997
such jobs are unquestionably useful , and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in europe .    3.0267281468324074
mr president , personally i voted in favour of this resolution , because the essential thing is that the european parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation .    4.307929278519908
if we dismantle the public service , this would be very serious , and we wish to know what are the commission ' s intentions .    5.37896244299321
saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate .    3.342944320695219
people who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so .    3.973066004131747
postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service .    3.372861435391552
occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day .    4.128660032542973
we can salute them , these postmen who , whatever the weather , sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone .    3.2359910179954743
dismantling the postal service , the local communication service , would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens .    4.709355662133191
profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion .    3.4277743668187073
mr president , i voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives .    3.000037326752163
several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman , particularly in mountain communities .    3.899575887047532
i wholeheartedly agree .    3.806268715701509
however , it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints .    3.646960883671961
in my own country , italy , there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately itl 50 million a year per capita , or eur 25 000 , that is , a total cost of around eur 5 million .    3.246362281511965
liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra itl 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled .    3.3487965409882623
that should UNK compensate them for UNK their contact with the postman .    3.3366669083175373
mr president , i voted in favour of the resolution on european postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position i have always defended in this house , which is the need for a high quality universal service , particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions , and there are some even in my small country , the grand UNK of luxembourg .    4.039201605212665
in these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities , as mr posselt explained so clearly , post offices and postmen have an almost socio - cultural role , i might say , which goes beyond merely delivering mail .    3.2449375066779815
i know that this service is unprofitable .    2.905207325826652
it would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages .    3.2846703849994285
in principle , i am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies , whether in water , gas , electricity , telephone , satellite , cable or any other services .    3.2224975294044764
nonetheless , liberalisation , which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service , especially in the telephone sector , must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears , when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money .    3.9935731088875337
if they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee , particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service , then the public service must be protected .    3.832455052670433
i feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service , even if our post offices operate like businesses .    3.8625255124944813
they clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email .    4.045290796066662
.    2.4274255028413507
( fr ) here indeed is a sector which has highlighted the limitations and serious deficiencies of liberalisation .    3.0692115346567777
i am not , personally , a UNK UNK in favour of monopolies , whether public or private , but when i see the results achieved by private firms in this sector i am reinforced in my position as a defender of public service !    4.08140583147647
if liberalisation continues in this area too , then there is a great risk that one day we will see entire regions with no postal service .    4.298883826009334
for who can believe for one moment that private firms , motivated only by profit , will continue to provide services in high - cost areas unless the costs are borne by the already disadvantaged inhabitants who are not , therefore , in a position to take advantage of the service .    3.6243552188681845
i should add that today , at a time when europe is revealing itself and is proving to be incapable of opposing the inclusion of fascists in a government within the european union , it is no longer acceptable to have an UNK which destroys public services foisted on us in the name of this same europe .    3.7955874596804082
i am a european and even a federalist .    3.6180366857646504
to achieve this i was ready and i am ready to make certain sacrifices , but not just anything ! most especially , i am no longer ready to accept the formation of a liberal single market if europe is not at the same time capable of defending the values on which it is based and which , in the UNK , made me a committed european !    4.505961443422076
president .    3.0050080721717225
parliament has completed the agenda .    3.0748342012467735
the minutes of this sitting will be submitted for approval by parliament at the beginning of the next part - session .    3.4549936262810803

statement by the president    5.699798284140239
ladies and gentlemen , as you know , on 22 february , eta struck again in a brutal attack in spain with the murder of fernando buesa blanco , the general secretary of the socialist party of UNK and the spokesman of the socialist party of the basque parliament , and jorge díez elorza , his bodyguard .    3.369393245543266
the same day , i conveyed my own and the european parliament ' s deepest sympathy and sincere condolences to the victims ' families .    3.20764421563343
these men paid with their lives for their commitment to democracy .    3.280848604787912
i utterly condemn this act of barbarism that is unworthy of any civilised society .    2.798692692170333
the rule of law and the respect of rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the european union is based .    3.834152392254054
terrorism , whatever form it takes , is unacceptable .    3.6625434855879164
in expressing the hope that these men will be the last victims of eta , i call on this organisation finally to cease resorting to violence and to use the democratic channels that exist in spain .    3.9136034916861555
i would ask you , ladies and gentlemen , to observe one minute ' s silence in memory of fernando buesa blanco and jorge díez elorza .    2.4336131143781334
( the house rose and observed a minute ' s silence )    1.9386441451792231
madam president , on behalf of the group of the party of european socialists , i want to thank you for your statement last tuesday and for your words today in memory of fernando buesa blanco .    2.4184867606964504
he was a member of the basque regional parliament , spokesman for the socialist party in that parliament and also a former vice - president of the basque regional government .    4.0484159936451745
anyone of my age - i am 54 - can remember their grandparents ' era and their parents ' era and , of course , is living in the current era . we can also see into the era in which our children will live .    3.6967253145743606
in my grandparents ' time , it took several days to travel from vitoria to UNK .    3.45100021182735
now you can go from vitoria to copenhagen in 2 or 3 hours by plane .    3.0497693716081176
today , at the end of the 20th century , a single market is operating in europe in which we will soon be using a single currency .    4.387117425974981
we can now travel much more easily than our grandparents could within spain or even within the basque country .    2.878561821935054
we are building a vast european area which will firstly be linked economically and then politically .    3.2238452032401446
the public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation .    4.172382270006367
in a debate within the socialist party on the irish process , someone said : " in the end , the key to the irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought : does it really matter whether we are irish or british ?    3.3249880847860314
everyone can be what they want to be because , if ireland and britain are both in the european union , there is no point in killing each other for being irish or british .    3.9437988247329394
what difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function ? "    3.3267235438491434
we in the basque country could ask ourselves the same question . does it really matter if we are basque or spanish or european ?    3.57177138942682
we have talked a lot about what it is to be basque , but a basque today UNK like a UNK and reads the same things as a british person .    4.006786947630175
if life is going to be lived on a much more global basis , as is already happening , and our children will therefore be living in the europe which we are creating , why are we killing each other for being basque or spanish ? '    4.134463829672586
fernando buesa also said the following , which everyone in ireland has probably thought . ' if we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in ireland because there were UNK groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the basque country too .    3.926117728338742
what difference does it make to be basque ? surely it is all the same thing .    3.3447459200958125
you can be what you want to be .    3.8866601709228026
if , in the future , economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the european arena , there is no point killing or dying for being basque or spanish ' .    3.7780853460133432
may he rest in peace .    3.345966177301254
( loud applause )    2.3309633389222304
madam president , on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party and european democrats , i want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of fernando buesa , an elected representative of the basque people , and jorge díez , a member of the basque police force . we also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the basque socialist party .    3.255881916443884
in recent times , in this house , we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in europe .    4.459654382235926
it does not matter what banner these come under because , in the end , they are all different expressions of the same thing .    3.6774741292076762
faced with these , we democrats cannot UNK ourselves to the peace of the dead .    3.2486946529138536
on the contrary , we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the basque country is the UNK which separates those who kill , and those who support and express understanding for the latter , from the vast majority of the basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom .    3.5214653625158236
( loud applause )    2.3309633389222304
madam president , on behalf of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , i must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 february in vitoria which took the lives of the socialist mp and spokesman in the basque parliament , fernando buesa , and his bodyguard , jorge díez .    2.697900474686517
in a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the european union , it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended , provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice , freedom and economic and social progress on which the union is based . the UNK of these principles is simply not acceptable , as clearly indicated in the treaties .    4.198136588850727
there is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of fernando buesa and jorge díez , particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the basque people .    3.378616424979581
we pray that these are the last victims in a process which , as you said , madam president , has seen much barbarism . we pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the basque people to live together in peace .    4.31624239211527
madam president , on behalf of the confederal group of the european united left / nordic green left , i must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the basque country . we send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop .    2.971534374015355
the terrorist organisation eta has , in its time , killed police officers and soldiers .    3.7881774408297004
it has placed a bomb in a UNK and killed men , women and children .    3.5064825598075138
in the streets of madrid it has killed a general , UNK UNK , who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981 .    3.2283363527953366
it has assassinated the spokesman of the popular party in the town council of san UNK , UNK UNK .    3.154070152858896
eta must be condemned . however , those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned .    3.8343274247353034
there is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road .    3.1358650145476585
we must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties , whether they are national or nationalist , and no matter how pro - or anti - european they are .    3.8956371359893964
it is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident .    3.534360734414572
all european democrats in this house must join together to send a message to the basque country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing . it is time to share the basque country , spain and europe .    4.306379701945558
this , madam president , is the only way forward which we therefore fully support .    3.902606663270217
madam president , on behalf of the union for a europe of nations group , i would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it .    3.014975424248216
for the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy , but i feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy , in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others , democracy and democratic life .    4.431631632681661
so , madam president , maybe we should consider taking some action if we want our sorrow and our rejection of terrorism to have any actual significance .    3.7087126221889166
why does parliament not meet in all the countries of the european union and show that it rejects terrorism ?    4.028521898521437
let us make ourselves heard !    2.941138651291209
we are not just confined to brussels or strasbourg .    2.8570150976752293
let us all go back to our respective nations and shout from the rooftops that our belief in democracy and our indignation are not just words , but a demonstration of our actual political commitment .    3.4370323558821534
madam president , as a member of the group of the greens / european free alliance and also as an mep for the basque nationalist party , i must firstly categorically condemn the UNK attack which took the lives of a basque police officer , jorge díez elorza , and the basque mp and former vice - president , fernando buesa .    3.113196796666167
secondly , we send our deepest condolences to their families , their socialist colleagues , the basque parliament and the basque police force . we also want to express our solidarity and heartfelt sympathy .    3.399831834568928
thirdly , we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which , by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people , not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people .    3.7744639667680273
fourthly , we express our UNK at the fact that this dual UNK was intended to directly destroy the political process aimed at achieving peace in the basque country .    3.3283400623942074
fifthly , we again call on the spanish and french leaders and politicians to show the same tolerance as in the united kingdom and ireland in order to resolve the current basque conflict with something more than police measures which , on their own , cannot bring about the peace which we all desire .    4.126942630581626
sixthly and finally , we reaffirm that eta ' s terrorism and violence must end . eta must stop UNK the will of the basque people who must be allowed to decide on their future freely and without violent coercion .    3.3303163500370334
just three months ago i took the floor in this house to congratulate the irish and british people on their success in reaching the northern ireland settlement , as many other colleagues did .    4.312430110040745
in northern ireland in the last thirty years too many people have been killed and injured - too many families UNK .    3.858112044817992
so far , unfortunately , in spain and france , just the opposite has been happening as regards the on - going conflict in the basque country .    3.595205801879802
we , euskal herritarrok , are convinced that a definitive solution to the present struggle can only be found through an open process of dialogue and negotiation with no limited agenda .    3.3453560062285845
before 20 january last , during UNK months , the only killing we witnessed in the kingdom of spain was that of josé luis UNK , member of eta , in march 1999 .    3.2221230377716497
in spite of that and the arrests made by the spanish and french police , including arrests of eta negotiators with the spanish government ' s agreement , eta honoured its unilateral ceasefire .    3.4834239962232774
then , last november , before the ceasefire was over , the spanish government spokesman , mr UNK , declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the basque country .    3.68714745297761
we , euskal herritarrok , have regretted many times the loss of human lives .    2.899596319410303
we share with all the basque citizens the UNK of our people .    4.391651580824706
we are committed to dialogue and ready to work together with all those eager to find a democratic settlement for the basque country .    3.446820732608786
twenty years have passed since the northern ireland question was first raised in this parliament .    3.405249075624002
may i ask : UNK tandem - UNK UNK ?    3.505962080814446
thank you , mrs dührkop dührkop , i should like to assure you of my UNK and sincere respect .    3.0884460628297696
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.3506184552294846
the minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .    2.2495165909057317
are there any comments ?    2.070454319710833
we are about to discuss the subject of reforming the commission and you will recall , madam president , that at the beginning of the last session , i raised with you the question of whether , in the interests of openness and transparency , the members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the internet .    4.2919443058069175
you promised parliament you would raise this subject with the quaestors that very evening .    3.2507371862262917
i wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to parliament that the quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the internet and , if so , whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 april - for doing so .    3.538626364826031
i can tell you , mr davies , that the bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the members ' register of financial interests on the internet and the quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve .    4.0234267189558475
but we shall have a decision very soon .    3.60516541131955
( the minutes were adopted )    2.928492989243576
reforming the commission    5.340354352957713
the next item is the commission statement on reforming the european commission .    2.435243123898133
- ( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , last july , here in your presence , i made a solemn commitment to reform the commission .    3.3149718044449985
i would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last july : the UNK commission had been in crisis , i had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination .    3.530467689758476
the UNK of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the commission , to reform it thoroughly , completely UNK the commission ' s way of working .    3.6321862708433854
today , that commitment has been fully discharged : you have the reform here , before you , in the form of an institutional white paper which has just been adopted by the commission .    3.7602578945185767
i would like to emphasise that , on that occasion too , the commission voted unanimously , with one voice .    3.670487168652577
briefly , these are the main points of the reform .    4.577530333085851
one : definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources .    2.864832780746934
this is at the heart of the system , and it is this , the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources , which will enable the political sphere to assert its UNK and to take its responsibilities fully on board .    4.180176469291291
in order to do this , we have created a completely new policy - planning mechanism , a system which will allow the college to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these , to assign well - defined objectives to the directorates - general and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control , which is of fundamental importance .    4.154224962362525
in this context , activity - based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives , actions and resources .    3.0599530458809823
the second point is human resources .    2.7509695013440765
they are extremely highly qualified , of a UNK which it is difficult , if not impossible , to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used .    4.374406374613441
this was the impression i received when i first became president of the commission , and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work .    3.3548442490942745
previously , there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution , but now staff are frequently UNK by the UNK criticism .    3.9585287602132464
all this has to change , and this is one of the main reasons for our reform .    4.30714426999913
these are the areas in which changes will be made .    3.082720569006759
the third point , which was also rather a sensitive , key issue in the recent crisis , is financial management .    3.982676118651312
this is the UNK of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security .    3.695493515655763
we are going to create a management and control system in every directorate - general .    3.8994918996225967
at the moment , our control system is completely centralised ; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system .    2.8668852579015187
this means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice , decentralisation in every directorate - general of the entire chain , that is of programmes , undertakings , contracts , expenditure and the related ex ante control systems , and an external auditing service which will direct these operations .    3.6679386325442738
this is a complete revolution of the commission ' s way of working ; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking .    4.106490306593845
we are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage , and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff : we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place .    3.604040776936117
in fact , the commission UNK this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of europe and the world .    4.522485690704029
we also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology .    3.301002617914171
we want to be a model of a completely computerised administration .    4.178399343153003
the commission has been accused of being buried under UNK of paper , and so we are going to become a UNK commission .    3.7969639791190413
this will make the commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the commission .    3.92848238342103
this is not just a technical revolution , but a complete organisational revolution as well .    3.0621963007716935
i shall leave to UNK kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform , but i would first like to thank him for the intelligence , enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise .    3.527361442327307
we would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the commission staff , who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the commission .    3.7994925550012226
i would stress that this style of debate is something very new and , in my opinion , it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well .    3.489076231627714
the white paper before us is also the product of contributions from the commission staff : they knew that the commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become , once again , that internationally - admired institution which was at the heart of european history .    4.471129480234734
the adoption of the white paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and i hope that it will remain closed forever .    4.42846860961908
now we can focus on the future , on the challenges awaiting the union and on the programme for 2000 - 2005 , the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks .    5.035032404285479
the very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five - year plan .    3.4244989338704444
we need - the whole union needs - a strong commission , a commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions .    3.77350470913145
this is why we are redefining all our work priorities .    2.6829842238098096
this is why we are UNK all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity .    4.335944614702653
for this reason , we are reforming the administrative machinery in order to create the necessary conditions for us to be able to carry out our work efficiently .    3.965516779981178
we will make the best use of the resources at the commission ' s disposal , but they are very limited and we have almost exhausted them .    4.640380459284966
we may need to come back to you and ask for additional resources to fund the new tasks which have been assigned to us and those which will be assigned to us in the future .    4.04253093505186
in september , we undertook to present a white paper on reform , and today we are fulfilling that undertaking according to the conditions established in your presence .    4.156740069142545
the commission wishes to be judged on results and results alone - on what we achieve .    3.415153220597133
i would , however , remind you , and this is my final point , that the commission is not the only community institution .    4.8459541176517975
parliament and the council are also called upon to take up all the challenges presented by these reforms .    3.9680475413107494
the commission has resolutely forged a path , and i hope that all the institutions will follow it right to the very end , in the service of the citizens of europe , to achieve an ever - stronger and ever more transparent europe .    4.034493288815743
i am glad to be here together with president prodi and my colleague , UNK schreyer , to present the white paper adopted by the commission this morning : " reforming the commission " .    3.789960617393206
as honourable members will see from the document , which will be available to them today , the unprecedented consultations with the staff of the commission , with this parliament and with the council , which have taken place since the adoption of the consultation document in january , have been very productive and resulted in useful UNK .    4.551871759823722
together with romano prodi , i express my gratitude to this house and to the very large number of people who have put time and effort into giving us their constructive responses .    4.2953389720137585
the white paper puts reform in its proper political context .    3.127619735776092
in the commission , systems and structures have built up over forty years in which successive enlargements have occurred .    3.4176916937821207
the treaties have been revised , new managerial tasks have been attributed by this parliament and by the council to the commission , and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our union , in our continent and in the world .    4.487338087221201
those realities , together with the approach of further enlargements , all counsel strongly for modernisation of the commission , so that this essential institution can fulfil its primary tasks of policy conception and development , of treaty application and of management of the public resources and do so with maximum effectiveness , maximum responsibility and maximum accountability .    3.707311789203622
the sustained independence and strength of the commission are , of course , basic to that mission as this house has repeatedly recognised .    4.519679570776084
reform and renewal are essential for that purpose too .    3.700632166961033
the commission is not and will not be a secretariat of any kind , and that is clear to all of the institutions - it is well understood everywhere .    4.7648340469923784
that is what the public has the right to expect and it is what the people who work for the commission want to provide and will provide .    4.5197836244428125
the house will be aware , of course , that the commission cannot fulfil these objectives alone .    4.375918579934833
all institutions in the european union will have to face up to the issues posed by the reform and face up to them honestly and responsibly .    4.058616400607176
i know that my colleagues and i can count on the support of many members of this house across the spectrum .    3.877230623823254
one of the biggest challenges that may come from the essential efforts to match the tasks of the commission with the resources of the commission will confront this house .    4.915241822749053
last month , as romano prodi has just said , we launched a thorough evaluation of activities and resources throughout the commission and we will fully report on that in september .    3.9156910102343656
our aim is to focus the commission on essential policy priorities and on core activities in line with our strategic policy objectives for the next five years .    3.406931048015716
inevitably , that will mean identifying activities that could and should be reduced or ended .    3.887900717966821
it means taking a very hard look at how the use of internal and external resources can be most effectively balanced in the interest of the union .    3.421391495898374
it means allocating staff to areas of high - policy importance within departments and across the commission .    3.1105467116081384
and when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us .    3.4812282135794055
if they are proven not to be , we will put the case for more resources to the budgetary authority .    4.606059742659671
if that does not meet with a positive response , the difficult issue of which of our lower - priority activities should be discontinued will then have to be addressed , not just by the commission , but by this parliament and by the council too .    3.910755546815257
i do not make this point because of any desire in the prodi commission to UNK from activities or responsibilities .    3.514680163278817
on the contrary , as many in this house understand , i am setting out these considerations because we want to meet our responsibilities and meet them with full effectiveness and full accountability .    4.210952311476511
that means closing any significant gap between obligations and operational resources either by reducing activities or by increasing means or by a combination of both .    2.916972489432874
the new activity - based management system , that the president just mentioned , will link political priorities to the availability of resources and consequently to the budget for the first time .    4.086448715211063
the role of the budgetary authority in the operation of UNK will , therefore , be vital .    4.294071397273639
attempts to micro - manage the commission ' s operations are clearly in no one ' s interest .    4.436772150688083
a UNK and practical interinstitutional agreement will , therefore , be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activity - based management .    3.3617798766205547
in human resources policy , the involvement of parliament will unavoidably have to be as an employer of civil servants as well as a democratic institution to which the commission is accountable .    4.952852536016292
again , that will be a very demanding challenge .    4.199742349052642
and finally , in the crucial area of financial management where the court of auditors , the committee of independent experts and other external and internal analyses have strongly advised radical change , the support of this house in implementing the recommendations for full security of money and value for money will be of prime importance .    3.7547111181127417
in the limited time available for this statement , it is obviously impossible to go into the full details of our proposals .    4.119486831540243
i have no doubt that we will do that on several occasions in the coming months and years , and i certainly look forward to the questions of honourable members this afternoon .    3.978370283477149
it is clear , of course , that in many ways the really hard work starts now , with the implementation of our proposals .    4.2113958154283075
i look forward to working with this parliament , with the council and with the staff of the institutions to ensure that the reform strategy is put fully into effect for the benefit of the union and for the advantage of all of its peoples .    5.141744613440232
thank you , commissioner kinnock .    2.3826507168743456
we shall now move on to question time .    2.8090850937429352
madam president , the commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials .    3.210523108271795
recently , the immunity of a former commissioner was lifted and proceedings are currently pending before a judge in brussels on the basis that brussels is the seat of the community institutions .    3.115264824498248
yet these institutions have other seats and , given that the community ' s actions affect the whole community territory , there are in fact thousands of courts which could judge officials , commissioners and so on .    4.0242691191961
is the commission aware that , in order to lift immunity , it would be necessary to adopt a new legal instrument to regulate the procedure for holding commission officials accountable , including former and current commissioners ?    4.233658989232582
there is effective legal precaution .    3.2931018123251223
in the particular case that the honourable member has in mind , not only did the commission easily and quickly come to a decision to waive the immunity of a former commissioner , but the former commissioner herself advised the commission of her desire that the immunity should be lifted .    3.6576169276723305
i can see the complexities that concern the honourable member , but i say to him that in the last five years there have been ten cases in which there have been requests from national legal authorities for the immunity of 26 officials to be lifted , and every single one of those requests has been met , and met with UNK .    3.9787804813538594
i think that the house can therefore be confident that not only are the civil rights of individuals who may be accused or required to produce evidence safeguarded , but so is the interest of the properly constituted legal bodies of every member state in seeking to get information , or the right to interview or investigate anybody associated with the commission .    3.511882144416618
as the parliament ' s rapporteur on the staff elements of your report , mr kinnock , i very much welcome the fact that we are now starting the process , and if i may say to all colleagues here , we have a very important task to do , which will be absolutely central to the future of the commission and its effectiveness .    5.204514721007255
that will form part of the work that we will have to do and i sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process .    4.647971853734343
now there were two points i wanted to pick up with mr kinnock , if i may .    3.804507866739449
the first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms .    2.820490602008661
mr prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the commission about low morale and low motivation , and clearly that is a major concern .    4.178281067796922
big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the commission and outside .    4.602826005227048
and if we are to move forward , i suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side , early evidence of change of culture , UNK and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later .    3.4390144022135605
and if we look at the original proposals - and i suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the staff regulations .    4.496510955618025
indeed , it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced .    3.865476516987649
i suggest that is too long , and we really must move forward much more quickly than that .    4.16147843705546
the second point that i want to make concerns information technology .    3.497128273878926
have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about , because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms .    3.6179531034345
on the second part of mr harbour ' s question , he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change , not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the commission , as the president briefly outlined in his statement .    4.380239069074697
could i thank mr harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale , the motivation and the professional commitment of commission officials , which is already very strong , will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training , the allocation of responsibility , the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing .    4.244545580812004
cultures are products of structures and systems , and the structures and systems have become old .    4.296558311604476
by UNK those structures and systems , in some cases very radically , we will assist the people of the commission who are strongly committed to the european ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before .    4.118739159418566
i would like to make one last point in answer to mr harbour .    2.79614635156238
i share his UNK to secure the full implementation of the mechanisms of reform and change practices .    3.8522681107028016
i wish i could honestly say to him that we will be compiling and providing in the form of proposals communications before 2001 and certainly be putting them into effect before 2002 , but he will be aware there are legally required consultation procedures and periods which we must respect .    3.604564225901925
i do not use those as an excuse .    3.351022981018486
we indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and i believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms , these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake UNK .    4.010863272109642
i would like everything to happen much more quickly .    3.1589778744160633
it is better to do it absolutely properly .    3.1908816842286343
madam president , we admire mr kinnock ' s vision and sense of realism . for he is holding up visions of a well - UNK and effective administration and is , at the same time , drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated .    3.4146396530586838
mr prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities .    4.733397147713604
we will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first .    3.5290558306092628
i think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities , because i can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise .    3.744612262225484
enlargement - that is enlargement of the union - is one of the key challenges in this context .    4.508540102363725
i would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace , it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board .    3.7335229810452613
we must resolutely switch from our present , rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace .    3.466220148743769
could mr kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the council and parliament to come up with for these priorities ?    3.7812130572367844
i am grateful to mrs maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this house .    3.467242373084796
can i assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out .    2.927383173209657
we are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities , not in order to UNK any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have .    4.4114065645175575
one of those obligations very clearly - and i am at one with mrs maes in this - is in the preparation for effective , smooth , calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current union .    4.673842536393793
one of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect .    3.80735893158285
can i say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity - based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any UNK .    3.217231151183325
since i was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised , i may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our UNK view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the union and its enlargement .    4.784142845672793
i hope that , in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the council and with parliament , not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way , but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the union .    4.565118699743844
i would like to take the opportunity firstly to congratulate the commission on unanimously bringing forward this timely and substantial white paper with the accompanying action plan and i think when the president of the commission described his vice - president as acting with intelligence , enthusiasm and energy that indeed that is a fair and valid description with regard to this procedure .    3.7953353501772034
two questions if i may .    3.4536658783291694
we anticipate , if i understand correctly , a report in september on core activities .    3.6510017151951715
will that already begin to impact possibly in some form of amendment to the budget exercise which the parliament will have to close in the last quarter of this year in respect of the budget for 2001 and can you already say whether the commission UNK such a procedure ?    4.537377720495415
secondly , on the question of ex ante and ex post auditing and procedures , do i understand correctly - and i have not had the opportunity to UNK into the detail of the paper - that the unanimous decision of the commission is indeed to empower the directorates - general to liberate them from the ex ante UNK system but to put in their place a strong ex post and independent and centralised audit system ?    4.104446235490961
if that is the case i can say at least that after prolonged and at times engaging discussion each way in my own group , i believe that if we have demanded in this house as we have done that we have responsibility at each level in the commission , its necessary counterpart is that we free people up to be managers .    4.901306480533468
let the managers manage .    3.422071377200841
i want to thank mr cox and indeed his group for the way in which several members have strongly engaged themselves and interested themselves in the detail of reform which can sometimes be rather trying but is always , as he indicated , worthwhile .    3.361222558909594
so far as the september communication is concerned , it is unprecedented .    4.8172668000107235
it will not be just one of the UNK that the commission has UNK undertaken but a very thorough and sharp review within directorates - general and across the commission for which we have established a mechanism for reviewing the demands on us and the means that we have to meet those demands .    4.259200994968565
it is conceivable therefore - i cannot say with absolute certainty at this stage - that at that stage in the budgetary procedure and in the cycle in which parliament is engaged we may have to - i emphasise very strongly the conditional - we may have to come to parliament with some conclusions and discuss the possibility of revision .    3.8898135692643043
that is a sensible forecast to make , it is not an ambition that we have but it is a possibility that we may have to entertain .    4.9951685316581536
can i thank mr cox for underlining the virtue of following absolutely the recommendation of the committee of independent experts and introducing a system which will end definitely with the revision of the financial regulation and the end of centralised ex ante control .    3.709630284765734
i would emphasise , too , that the intention is not only to liberate the personnel of the commission - that is certainly an objective - but it is simultaneously to " UNK " - it is an appalling word but we all know what it means .    5.26035756166105
in undertaking such a development in our organisation i am certain that we can match or even advance upon the success and increase in job motivation which has come as a consequence of similar developments in several administrations , both in the public sector and in the private sector , in the last decade or so .    4.012984305642905
i think that the end of the centralised system will certainly not result in any UNK of effective financial control but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship to operational tasks .    3.476533591623965
financial control will be absolutely secured , both because of the way in which we will introduce the changes , and because we will introduce a completely professional , independent internal audit service .    3.9001760006951045
as i said earlier , our ambition is total security for money and value for money .    2.6710991372154496
we are also interested in value for the people who work for us .    3.3357074718675985
i am also grateful , at the risk of being UNK , to mrs theato for the consistent attention that she has given to these matters and indeed the way in which , if she will allow me to say so , she played UNK to many of the changes which we are now contemplating .    4.668861782440224
i hope that she will come to take pride in the child for which she has at least part UNK .    3.363230473161349
first of all , i am not sure if i got the interpretation properly , but i do not think it would be possible for someone as expert as mrs theato to talk about the abolition of independent financial control .    3.563077336383204
there is a degree of independence obviously allocated to the current financial controller by the financial regulation .    3.663361946435337
however , because of the mixture of roles of both financial management and control , and audit under the present terms , it is very difficult to think of this as an UNK role , no matter how great the integrity of the person actually holding it .    3.54280161375112
so , the changes that we seek to make - as i say consistent with the very strong and clear recommendations of the committee of independent experts - are not negative in any way at all .    3.431407215160706
one is to ensure high quality training , another is to ensure that no directorate - general can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the UNK of the system , another is the establishment of a central financial service , as honourable members will see from the white paper , to ensure that those standards are set and supervised , and there is also the additional belt and UNK and UNK approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service .    3.8725222279923845
   3.7318943719743674
i will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but i am certain that on examination mrs theato will be able to see that in the details of the white paper , there are very strong assurances .    4.479801517337171
there will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this house particularly in the committee on budgetary control , and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in directorates - general .    4.363971756146899
naturally , there are diverse requirements across the commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular directorates - general have to engage .    4.031411314049764
account is taken of that too in the white paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system , it most certainly can be used .    4.789918409156794
lastly on transition , i share the reservations of mrs theato over so - called " soft law " .    3.3037450775046593
we have had this discussion before and she knows i make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what i suppose we could call " hard law " .    3.060107022362472
but , on this issue , i do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this house and in the council .    4.315086709247724
there are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the white paper .    3.514673340926538
in addition , however , and very importantly , because it is a transition period , there will be training , there will be advice , there will be support , there will be assurances .    4.833753011386058
the new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 may and with that and an accumulation of other assurances i think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition .    3.887187179826173
two other points i must make , because this is an essential question central to reform .    4.6943225622188685
the first one is that people feel - for reasons i well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia .    3.417844471259924
irresponsibility because the feeling exists in some quarters that there will not be sufficient control and discipline .    3.7419011395083523
i completely reject that simply because of the standards of commission officials , the responsibility of directors - general and the assurances that we have built into the system .    4.206266671034269
inertia would only be born of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to diminish the possibility of that occurring .    4.718240917497682
lastly , the system we currently have - as the committee of independent experts asserted very strongly - is now unsustainable .    3.6196868487423175
indeed the court of auditors has called it fiction .    3.429840697459354
change will have to come in any case , change would imply a transition period because there is no possibility of any system being invented that could enable us to move from one friday to the next monday from one system to another .    4.0717895108737885
in so far as it is at all possible with all of the advice at our disposal and all of the design capability that we have , i am certain that we have installed , or that we will UNK on the basis of our proposals , a system that will provide the union , its taxpayers and this house with complete security .    5.652604214807122
madam president , great importance has been attached to the reform process , which deserves to be acknowledged , although this may be somewhat premature .    3.566582694862637
my question is this : there is a need for reform , due not least to the accession of new countries , and thus to the enlargement of the union .    3.628305046580839
how can we - the commission , parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively , taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries ?    3.8520373230613627
the delegations are actively engaged - as am i in my delegation for relations with the czech republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced UNK tone to our dealings with one another .    3.5729496311743767
how can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the european parliament , the national parliaments and also the commission , and the work they perform together , more effective ?    5.10687005476606
i am grateful to the honourable member for underlining the fact that , apart from its own inherent merits , reform will be made necessary by accession , the enlargements , and particularly the kind of enlargements that our union will shortly be engaging in .    3.611431390823876
it is essential that we have that reform , both for the sake of the current union , and certainly to facilitate UNK .    4.132764318620598
in the course of the coming years i will be continuing the practice i have already started , together with several of my commission colleagues obviously , of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new member states .    3.5854559740033736
we are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering .    4.262745210826489
i would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current member states and by the union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the commission and officials and UNK in the member states have to deal with the realities , the complex realities of membership of the union and the single market , it will be difficult to see the joins .    4.91133225332335
that is the level of UNK and provision i would like to see .    4.126438455163966
all i can do now is to promise to strive for it .    3.7156571269732916
can i start by wishing the commissioner a very happy st david ' s day .    3.10628057109006
thank you for the presentation .    3.2996680603227886
it is important that the commission never UNK sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it UNK with the european public .    4.210287763358829
that really has to be the sharp focus the whole time .    4.45229136308001
it has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays i am sure will be very welcome , but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork . excessive paperwork .    3.915726491998285
is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to european funding whilst ensuring financial control ?    2.8826456373701164
that is a clear complaint that we get .    3.610599846728548
that needs to be addressed .    3.518527496441427
the other question i would like to ask is on the audit progress committee .    3.8263614661686356
this , of course , is welcome , but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the european parliament within our discharge procedure .    4.715979166403652
will you be adding that into your audit progress committee ' s work ?    3.3036960157849284
finally , the socialist group agrees with activity - based budgeting and with UNK and you will be judged , as mr prodi says , by your actions , not your words .    3.8600527496806434
the mission of UNK with the european public is critical as mrs morgan says and that can only be done on the basis of action not words .    4.424803559645045
i say that with some UNK in the european parliament where there are so many experts in words , but we will try to lead by example .    4.8126621571082575
as far as excessive paper is concerned , the dilemma is UNK out by mrs morgan .    3.6429299414920826
we UNK the excess of paper , but given the requirements that we have to check and re - check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control , sometimes the requirements of administration , which some call bureaucracy , are unavoidable .    4.014765094890317
in order however to strip back those obligations to their minimum , we are not just talking about it ; we will be appointing in the very near future a deputy secretary - general , an additional deputy secretary - general with the specific mandate and mission of identifying best practices and spreading them throughout the commission and of ensuring a radical reduction in the procedures which generate so much paper , so much bureaucracy and i must say so much frustration , not only for the citizens and businesses of the union but for the people who work for the commission too .    4.065039532700775
one of our difficulties is always going to be of course that the better we are at reform , the less anybody is going to know about it so we will be relying on our friends and partners in the european parliament to explain with their customary generosity the full efforts being made by the commission to properly serve the people of europe .    4.355590883161324
i know i can rely on everyone here .    3.1615814312146067
that concludes question time .    2.4246667551966974
i should like to thank president prodi and commissioner kinnock .    3.0660198786298474
statement by the high representative for common foreign and security policy    3.0418844623933152
the next item is the statement by the high representative for common foreign and security policy .    1.9015788341110558
please give a very warm welcome to mr javier solana to whom i shall hand over without further delay .    3.148516591511131
madam president , ladies and gentlemen , it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again , here in the european parliament .    3.034580274814587
much has happened since the last time i was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent .    3.2400624624063874
sometimes we may feel that too much has happened .    3.3419693469914162
this afternoon i should like to share with you some ideas , particularly on the common foreign and security policy .    3.4034234833055024
the world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred . however , i will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me .    3.5714046484109185
in recent months , since the last time i appeared before you , important events have occurred in this house and also in the european union . i would remind you of two of these events , one of which is very dear to you all as members of this parliament , and particularly to the president .    4.900997857753567
these are the opening of the intergovernmental conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the european union .    3.0787446968215924
the events in kosovo and the balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds . there are also important issues at stake in the middle east in which the president of this house played a major role on her recent trip .    3.977381752866365
certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between europe and africa in which i was pleased to participate in cooperation with the portuguese presidency . a vital meeting has also taken place in portugal , in UNK , with the eighteen countries of latin america to try and develop a deeper relationship between the european union and latin america .    4.252564722189184
chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and i will speak briefly on this at the end , in the light of an important conversation which i had this morning with the council of europe representative , mr álvaro gil - robles , on his recent visit to the region .    4.489907461532847
however , i realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in europe since helsinki .    3.251696039101928
i will speak of this briefly . if you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time , i will be pleased to answer them .    3.714855698567074
the helsinki summit under the finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago .    3.557820271694651
decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent .    3.4104372255160453
these were essentially of three types which i will describe .    3.5070651280455882
the first was the decision to establish within the european union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management .    3.7331818311702847
the first is a political and security committee , the second is a military committee representing the chiefs of staff of the fifteen member states and the third committee is to make decisions on the european union ' s relations with third countries and other organisations .    3.9093523736775495
this basically involves relations between the european union and the atlantic alliance and relations between the european union and those countries which , although geographically in europe , are not part of the european union , or at least not at the moment .    4.015467244799136
i will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events .    3.7781561058552704
firstly , with regard to the decision - making bodies , the political and security committee met for the first time this morning , 1 march 2000 . this committee was established by the last general affairs council .    3.976905146008797
i was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch .    3.389330121396473
you can be satisfied with the progress made .    3.4271969158637483
the fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months .    3.8635269828060776
secondly , the military committee , which represents the various chiefs of staff of the fifteen countries , will hold its first meeting on 7 march which will be just over two months after the helsinki declaration .    3.3301951264003216
this military committee , as you can imagine , will have various duties .    4.259216206274909
in the interim stage , its basic duty will be to advise the council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will , of course , try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next .    4.533976669091711
thirdly , the military staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries . together with myself , this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare , with the assistance of the military committee , any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the european union .    3.418512218875997
this crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the military committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces .    3.497478722007321
mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics , not for military purposes , but with strictly humanitarian ends .    3.6938200798601817
we are therefore working diligently in this respect . madam president , if , a few months ago when i had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time , i had told you that i would be able to announce on 1 march 2000 that the first meeting of the political committee had been held today , that the military committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the military staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use , many of you would surely have thought that the high representative was going mad .    4.609960717985523
we are not mad . what we have done is to work long and hard , with determination and , without a shadow of a doubt , with the support not only of yourselves but also of the heads of state and government of the countries which you represent .    3.800097076136652
few initiatives within the european union can have been progressed with such determination , drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since helsinki .    3.797279786578555
in less than two months we have established the UNK for cooperation with the commission .    3.946227632770305
i must thank commissioner patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time .    3.7271410708933974
i will now move on to the second issue which i should like to discuss with you . we have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility .    4.3998487899352865
europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis . i must repeat that the european union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace .    4.076110478436729
it will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict , to re - establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them . as you may recall , it was in this respect that the helsinki summit UNK agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the member states .    4.091047933858292
it will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days , or two months , to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year . this is a major operation and an important objective but i can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the heads of state and government posed in helsinki .    3.742903706474546
on monday , just two days ago , in sintra , a beautiful city very close to lisbon , the defence ministers of the fifteen member states met and took some important decisions towards implementing this headline goal defined in helsinki .    3.2013301062134674
the proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us , including this house .    3.2570795690199006
i will set this out in five points .    3.329549485518987
firstly , before the next general affairs council which will take place this month , we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the headline goal , bearing in mind the views that the military UNK may consider appropriate .    4.002045612424293
to say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace .    4.311605011390159
we must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well .    2.8423708773339
before 24 march we will therefore have established this timetable so that the general affairs council can , on this date , do its job and do it well .    3.556260578053029
secondly , we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries .    3.2550724434942
thirdly , we must look at the differences between the headline goal and what each country can provide .    3.416950396869866
we may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs .    4.398912258857758
how can we do this ?    3.2615374189662636
madam president , the timetable must ensure that , by december of this year during the french presidency , the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match . we will then be able to say UNK that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available .    4.725878165869763
this is what we are doing and we are committed to this .    3.479282363297687
we have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the portuguese presidency , which is clearly carrying out excellent work , and during the french presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions .    3.806094832632166
i would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four european councils , those in lisbon and feira and two during the french presidency .    3.510949397615714
on these four occasions , the heads of government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that , by the year 2003 , we are able to deploy what we have agreed , if necessary .    5.042057874286076
madam president , we are therefore working on this issue with determination , energy and the full support of all the governments and all the heads of government .    4.10575891473068
i have two further points to make on this process .    3.099606298407366
the european union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which i have referred which , although geographically in europe , are not members of the european union .    3.5045385935743956
we have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises , which i hope will not be the case , all forces and all countries will be more than welcome .    4.090453399889103
secondly , we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with nato . the operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types .    4.270987027166233
the first type will be operations in which european forces are involved within the framework of nato . the second will be operations involving european forces and directed by them , but using the means and infrastructure of nato .    3.5121206762225916
the third will be operations in which the european forces act alone . in the first and second types we will need to cooperate with nato and must therefore establish a transparent , positive and confident relationship between ourselves and nato , as appropriate , which will be good for both the alliance and ourselves .    3.9363710513533765
madam president , i have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide , the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months .    4.6426597524794655
however , we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well .    2.957847976286765
as far as possible , we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in kosovo and the balkans .    3.5235079439512718
we are working in this direction with the commission and commissioner patten .    4.806563938340359
on saturday morning i will meet with all the ministers for home affairs of the fifteen member states to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well .    4.211436274933675
there are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that , after a few months , a police force is needed rather than a military force . then , in the final moments of the crisis , it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police .    3.9192714023781403
in this respect we are also working closely and positively with the commission .    3.4276533170716386
i am not going to say much more on these issues .    3.016295119713002
many other events have taken place in recent weeks which i should like to mention , such as in kosovo , the middle east and chechnya . there are also many other issues which i should like to discuss with you .    4.41864040376976
however , i would prefer , madam president , to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that i have time to answer them .    4.2735333270097176
however , before this happens , i must tell you about a telephone conversation which i had a few hours ago with the council of europe representative on the subject of chechnya .    3.7979906714543903
mr gil - robles returned this morning from chechnya where he visited grozny . when we spoke he gave me his initial UNK which are not good , as you can imagine .    3.46959359497108
the situation in the refugee camps in ingushetia is poor and deteriorating .    2.8493048006622033
in most cases there is no hot food during the day as the russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non - governmental organisations .    3.6584881507994336
in grozny , there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat .    3.617462372749163
yet there is one positive point which i must share with you .    3.528398541142843
mr gil - robles told me that , when talking with the acting president and the foreign affairs minister last night , the russian authorities had agreed to allow council of europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the russian authorities . the latter were also in negotiation with the chairman - in - office of the organisation for security and cooperation in europe to allow osce representatives to be involved as well , if feasible .    3.757070696052523
these are the only positive aspects which i can tell you about at the moment .    3.427064260435693
i hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from commissioner gil - robles and , in particular , better news from the russian authorities .    3.691256648641783
madam president , this brings me to the end of my speech .    3.7885450771953204
i would just like to repeat what i said at the beginning .    2.8869479313375397
i am delighted to be participating in the work of this house and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the commission . this work has one clear objective of allowing our european union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations .    4.246479262807259
thank you very much indeed , mr solana . i shall now give the floor to mr poettering , on behalf of the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and european democrats .    2.7920341179720904
thank you , mr poettering .    2.4495975917224038
mr poettering , it goes without saying that commissioner patten ' s participation in this debate is most opportune , and we have agreed that i will allow him to speak when he so wishes .    4.084133184639777
commissioner , would you like to speak now or a little later ?    3.746439989030707
( the commissioner indicated that he would speak later ) very well , thank you .    3.5673745523344556
madam president , commissioner patten , mr javier solana , UNK no es una persona UNK , UNK UNK UNK ( you are not mad , quite the opposite ) .    3.4803493992947265
we know that you have an important role in this .    3.430848878994248
i am also very pleased that you have mentioned mozambique today , and in this context , and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question .    4.613152757361758
we cannot , of course , talk about foreign policy without mentioning chechnya .    3.3136614980754424
my friend jacques poos will be talking about this on behalf of my group .    3.3204865025574426
i want to concentrate on kosovo .    3.094752498474779
it is now quite clear that the situation in kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means .    3.6460417854522014
the kfor forces have made , and are making , an invaluable contribution , but tanks and fire UNK cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term .    3.3473645594925885
it has now reached the point where the UNK has prohibited american forces from returning to northern mitrovica .    3.0018643062903374
they have now been replaced by robust danish , finnish and swedish troops .    2.773438928702002
it is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred , but it is important for the sake of kosovo , the balkans and europe that we do not fail .    4.10894003885924
through the stability pact , we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation .    3.9174594912578913
this is therefore a test of credibility for the union ' s common foreign and security policy .    3.107679412083995
at the moment , there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in kosovo .    3.346796569345232
last autumn , we already heard mr bernard kouchner call for a civilian police force .    3.6469950417421533
i am now delighted to hear that , this weekend , mr javier solana is to call the UNK ministers together to discuss the question of policing .    3.551208718609181
i hope that this discussion will , in the first place , concentrate upon kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied .    3.5888734396450617
when it comes to the balkans and kosovo , i also hope that the council will comply with parliament ' s and , as i understand it , also the commission ' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in kosovo .    4.5415386083244575
the situation in kosovo has taught us a lot , for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management , an idea which has already been translated into practical action .    4.4384633459714715
another , at least as important , lesson of our experience , however , is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently .    4.181025161481888
therefore , the eu must also have an independent , credible conflict - prevention capacity .    3.5523746988043814
on behalf of the commission , commissioner patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction .    4.251681551152167
i am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non - military operations and to introduce headline goals for non - military operations , together with a commission crisis centre .    3.0507624205464694
my last question to mr solana is this : what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind ?    4.241683322849975
how have these been organised by mr solana ' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the commission ?    3.8537390573400234
mr president , mr solana , you have the full support and confidence of the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party , but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders .    3.234495011397337
i am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian , peace - keeping and peace - making tasks .    2.9907642037959667
but i am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new european cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between nato and the eu or between the united states and europe .    3.805580169656209
such a split would only delight the UNK and UNK states which threaten freedom and human rights .    3.439156611691795
i believe you heard the concerns which some members of the american congress expressed last week here in parliament .    3.7139846463720554
you must lay these concerns to rest for , as you yourself have said , when we are able to present a united transatlantic front , we are in a position to do something .    4.821036179002507
when we are divided , we are weakened , and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged .    4.394892705678141
so , maintain as close contact as possible with our american allies and do not forget norway , turkey and canada , either .    3.3489774438455377
you also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper UNK .    3.6070402391423957
as UNK UNK has said so often , we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into kosovo .    4.157821195697958
it may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war .    3.369363258594851
diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats .    3.6963913008938065
everything else is UNK thinking .    3.443509905546746
that is why the member states must either authorise more expenditure or UNK their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment . we are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last monday in sintra .    3.537946381367196
the third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny .    3.613802342781672
this should be exercised first and foremost in the member states .    3.453558598332272
no soldier can , of course , be UNK without the approval of the relevant national parliament .    4.117750352331616
it is therefore wrong for people to talk about a european army .    3.466984895241058
it will be a force comprised of various national units .    3.3550435909622642
what is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment .    3.556082065018732
however , there is , of course , also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the european parliament .    3.4662780623740366
as someone who both speaks and UNK , we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy .    3.2426709601131387
finally , i should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion .    2.9585002597988375
he was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much .    3.5681768374154714
bear in mind that there are also non - aligned countries at the negotiating table .    3.7821039540974
we share your delight , as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is UNK .    3.2488062513213847
there is one thing i shall again finally emphasise : that the purpose of all this is , of course , that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all .    3.3069823243664165
that is the purpose of all this , and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with mr patten , for it is military , economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries .    3.526330427229766
mr president , mr solana , we are all behaving like children .    3.1569868793509155
you are building UNK in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers .    4.020361163345809
it is extraordinary what decisions we took in sintra concerning 2004 , 2005 , 2006 .    2.824454784565504
but what about kosovo in the year 2000 ?    3.0895320646544384
you have spoken to mr gil - robles . i have received an e - mail from a former colleague , pierre UNK , who is in pristina at the moment .    3.253277033782928
he tells the story of a serbian doctor who has just been murdered in pristina .    3.2484340101809197
he treated roma , albanians and serbs and that is something unforgivable in kosovo .    3.6575184296551018
a man with three children and he was murdered .    3.2518026214598015
we need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice .    3.3444528729423375
i am not a warmonger , but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in kosovo , then what is the point in having soldiers at all ?    3.7559383060383618
people may have to risk their lives in kosovo , but that is the price of freedom at the moment .    4.838946136521265
if we allow what is happening today in kosovo to continue - border provocation , serbian provocation , albanian provocation , etc . we are heading for war .    3.370738769925499
tell me , what civilian forces are being mobilised , mr patten ?    3.369802309526148
we need a civilian task force in kosovo now to monitor what is happening , and to tell the military and the police what they must do , otherwise everything we did in bosnia and everything we did in kosovo will be UNK by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence .    3.658933255460749
( interruption from the extreme right by mr martinez ) we have a major problem , because we are providing travel warrants for the people , but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis , as in chechnya .    4.864819259883981
mr poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so .    4.0047700585898625
i am in favour of a UNK policy against austria , but we shall then have a responsibility towards russia .    3.8403644269162425
i do not like foreign ministers who say nothing - whether they are german and from my party , whether they are french from the broad left or whether they are italians from any party !    3.2434975968080306
in the current situation , we should say to the russians " if you want money , if you want us to reduce your debts , you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into russia " .    4.2492613410469176
if not , we are not prepared to pay for their war , since , by reducing the debt , by giving them money , we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres .    4.054838858988117
we are UNK in the massacres in chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers .    4.044051489445038
it is not enough just to say , " you , the murderers , please stop the slaughter ! "    3.2710891115727914
they know full well that they should not commit these acts .    3.6083216857994573
do you think that mr putin does not know that what he is doing in chechnya is not good ?    3.638401354185035
from the beginning , he wanted this war in order to become president .    4.176863246470625
so that is the world as it is today .    3.8536116056530827
for that reason i say to you : my group is not entirely in agreement , but i am in favour of european defence .    3.981539849321284
i believe that european defence should be scrutinised by the european parliament and by the national parliaments .    3.852052783855122
first of all , the european parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers .    3.4676436561920325
if a civilian task force can , at the same time , intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step , we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers , but who are incapable of sending in civilians .    3.3973410268405426
as long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements , we shall not be credible .    3.509816857114122
mr president , mr solana , we are very uneasy about UNK to you because , in our view , you are responsible for an area that does not really exist .    4.440744259032043
we believe that poor old europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or , and this is possibly more serious , that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply UNK along with american politics .    3.4678340790244713
in the UNK mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of , at sintra , the fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is ' UNK ' called autonomous .    3.4190582440084487
now , the union can certainly call the body an ' action force ' even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the UNK - on paper - of men , weapons and logistics .    4.2882332039054685
but to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether .    3.59076942565403
what interests will this so - called force defend , in view of the fact that the countries of europe do not have the same interests ?    4.30480168145574
let us just consider for a moment .    3.153079069361768
what is the basis of armed action ?    3.7717165332027727
it is the defence of a territory , the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital ?    4.041036830715527
just what is an army in the absence of a home country , in the absence of territory - because europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders - and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests , which the fifteen have , for good reason , never dared to discuss .    4.090953820842798
in short , what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy ?    3.3347979969308406
we fall back on a kind of UNK army based on humanitarian rights , a kind of army in the service of vague ideas , of an ideal , the dangers of which have many times been shown in history .    3.533982805321924
but the cfsp will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system .    3.244291042519114
who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the UNK formed by london and berlin , UNK by their respective UNK , and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of washington , seeing themselves at best as bit - part players .    3.8708236238157956
mr solana , you yourself are a perfect illustration of this , as it were , structural complicity , passing smoothly from nato to the cfsp as if they were one and the same . of course , in reality , they are the same thing .    3.7749244353913176
it is still the old imperial service .    3.3273045373792667
it is not without some UNK that we have seen you , in your pathetic UNK with mr patten , present this delightful and most charming argument : one day you told a german newspaper , " i am the one that the americans phone up " .    3.6575394890058446
you might have added , mr solana , ' to give me their instructions ' , because that is what we see , in fact .    3.927771999511378
in the case of the balkans , just like everywhere else , one day the united states wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it .    3.4897048816217273
yes , jean - UNK martinez was indeed right to interrupt you , UNK cohn - bendit . in every case , it is follow - my - leader syndrome .    3.180097647394011
do you think i am going over the top ?    3.69011741976226
every day the news brings more proof of our UNK .    3.170975887206011
the experts speak of a cultural problem , i think they might be right !    4.251622146867783
on behalf of the combined european right , i must say to you , mr solana , as high representative for common foreign and security policy , we do not have confidence in you .    3.701627411981383
you say that you are against war , but as secretary - general of nato you started a war .    2.827574519496673
a war of aggression , UNK carrying out american military policy , in a sphere that was not that of the north atlantic treaty , against a state that had never been a member , that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non - interference as well as those governing the declaration of war .    4.108512314618869
today , even mr cohn - bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for .    3.549081817336068
we also have several questions to ask you that show our concern , that is the least one can say .    4.195557470646595
first of all , in your view , does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the member states of the union , as one might think , or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world ?    4.01078141055274
secondly , if you do recognise this right , then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on ?    3.7071262976258943
i can already hear your reply : humanitarian standards .    3.0237182021146576
in kosovo , it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in serbia .    3.6853568848083196
when the us killed 2 000 people in UNK , it was not to impose their politics , it was to combat drug trafficking .    3.9876128312187484
when they landed in UNK , before having to withdraw in UNK , it was not to guarantee their UNK of the oil route , it was to restore hope .    4.8717327137443345
' restore hope ' , do you remember ?    3.6481580170520265
in a nutshell , can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons .    2.9984693138054337
finally , you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management .    2.9619046281805055
not to make war , of course , but to protect peace .    4.365433803730059
but these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions .    3.064861374813038
can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any state you care to mention , particularly those which , in their elections , do not ratify the policy adopted by the other member states of the union ?    4.292186040852401
mr solana , these questions convey our concern .    3.1554827560189294
you say that you are against war , but you would not be the first warmonger to UNK that .    3.6845848482417347
may god spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward .    3.753053345584418
mr president , it goes without saying that the development of a european security and defence identity will have a huge impact on the three countries which joined nato last year : poland , the czech republic and hungary .    3.301167688648402
as candidate countries of the european union , they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning , that is to say as of now .    4.042944515767028
this request , however , was not honoured by the council at its helsinki summit at the end of last year . in the finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation .    4.07356647606513
this is why i would like to ask the high representative , mr solana , to what extent UNK , UNK and budapest are , or will be , involved in european military crisis management plans .    3.74892864232426
given poland ' s rather critical stance , this question is all the more pressing .    3.424541672831856
its reservation is UNK in the following , rather blunt wording : avoid american UNK and european UNK .    3.6298354505045243
as one might expect , the polish foreign affairs minister , mr UNK geremek , has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms : " the development of a european defence identity should not be at the expense of nato ' s unity .    4.224780739772772
if anything , the european defence identity should serve to strengthen nato " .    4.2028757674046595
we all very much share this opinion .    3.4622582808141265
minister geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new nato members from central and eastern europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today .    3.310933542293786
the czech defence minister , for example , shares this opinion . in the autumn of last year , the latter stated : " security within europe is not UNK .    4.150227423189045
it cannot be restricted to a small number of countries , with others only being allowed to observe or UNK decisions " .    3.306995549555349
these opinions add substance to my question addressed to mr solana .    3.785538174920152
UNK only need five words for this : nothing about us without us !    3.3811732623533715
what do the current eu member states intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries ?    3.5453013090057475
mr president , i too welcome the presence of the high representative and his availability to answer members ' questions this time round . on his first appearance in november this was not possible , although this was not mr solana ' s fault .    3.4548245755820126
it should be acknowledged , however , that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by members .    3.7256300204985884
we should also acknowledge the efforts which mr solana is making towards achieving a more effective , visible and coherent common foreign and security policy for the european union .    3.532140118540857
in this respect , i agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian , diplomatic , humanitarian and police elements , to which mr solana referred .    3.648838647283223
the portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies .    3.172634764442355
in record time it has organised this informal meeting of defence ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this common foreign and security policy .    2.7362555922514504
one of these milestones was the meeting in sintra which i would like to ask mr solana about .    3.742825536356867
this meeting was based on two documents , one being a british document on the headline goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the european union .    3.641812220649231
mr solana , would you be prepared , at your next appearance before the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit ? i should like to ask mr patten and , through you , the president - in - office to also attend and answer the same question .    3.1910829531017004
secondly , to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the french defence minister that the member states had to allocate 0 . 7 % of gdp to defence expenditure ?    3.79576555126171
i would like to hear your opinion . do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the member states in this respect ?    3.57982172316697
thirdly , what assessment would you make of the ' UNK 2000 ' exercises which have just ended in which , for the first time , the european union took part in a series of initiatives with the north atlantic treaty organisation ?    3.917616004092221
mr solana , as the rapporteur of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , i shall limit my speech to those subjects .    3.162007126317015
you have , mr solana , heard the force of the criticisms made by the members of parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in kosovo , chechnya and elsewhere .    4.143119513049607
for my part , i do not wish to give up hope .    3.9183996671633627
and today , as far as you are concerned , i acknowledge your efforts to build a european security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed .    4.403023033400463
indeed , we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective , in any case , the objective that i wish to achieve .    4.079221867904638
but i do give you credit for your intense work , the number of meetings held , your efforts to create a rapid intervention force , your specific efforts to prevent crises , to manage them or stop them through civilian means and , if necessary , by military means .    3.3610165578888758
i should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the " what is to be done " variety .    3.986327201162449
the first concerns the forthcoming european councils in june and december , without counting the extraordinary council meeting in lisbon .    2.7325257094016857
what are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings ?    3.4608797396439637
and finally , what do you most need at these next UNK ?    3.303408413766003
my second question is different , although it is not UNK with the previous one .    4.180540538368473
it concerns the next igc .    3.545912983102079
do you not think that the agenda of the igc should include the question of european security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties , if it appeared that , as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment , they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established ?    4.904234737921559
i believe that the italian president of the council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 february .    3.756052979640467
can you tell us your position on this subject ?    3.6671775445305705
mr president , bosnia and kosovo have shaken europe .    2.86350843878687
at long last , the european union UNK that it cannot afford to always give the americans the political and military initiative .    4.342060947136151
the decision to set up our own peace force is excellent .    3.4725438368844284
however , if europe wants to take military action at crucial times , the treaty must include a flexibility clause .    3.2666514747069404
mr solana can play an important role in this .    3.1847386620941966
he is not stupid . certainly not !    3.1580282288873796
he is a driven man , a competent man .    2.9124549730915423
but the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence .    2.9069492235944874
in addition to being secretary - general of the council , mr solana is also secretary - general of the weu , as well as high representative for the common foreign and security policy . he also heads the unity policy planning and the new early warning unit .    3.637680006085791
one wonders whether he gets any time to UNK , mr president .    3.999423211825756
from a democratic point of view , i actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable . this is exacerbated by the fact that mr solana is , of course , not a democratically elected politician , but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament .    4.216083532223858
his position threatens to UNK that of commissioner patten , as has been illustrated again today , in fact .    4.525687629635433
it appears that , as european security and defence policy takes shape , the commission and parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold .    3.941210273465577
this too is unacceptable in my view .    2.969295494639046
naturally , every attempt should be made to make european policy more efficient , but this should not lead to UNK - for concentrations of power .    4.028727835677867
mr solana must keep europe awake without UNK off himself .    3.028740036294859
mr president , peace is the european union ' s very raison d ' être . i am pleased about the fact that commissioner patten and mr solana have already underlined this repeatedly .    3.641632992721389
we have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy , cultural diversity and tolerance .    3.2322355131700817
but look at us now ! we are observing the misery in chechnya in a position of powerlessness , and regard the wars in africa with indifference , despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries , given that they are ex - colonies .    3.7699297768259354
some of them are our acp partners .    2.8289877238720655
the war is an extension of UNK underdevelopment .    3.6582733217694545
in kosovo , we stepped in with military means , having been unable to prevent the war in ex - yugoslavia .    3.880669012242542
we are now unable to guide the peace .    2.9776733283252845
this is why europe is not credible as a union .    3.2935125271011594
i do not believe , mr solana , that we can restore this credibility by military means .    3.5937756994335874
as representatives from the group of the greens / european free alliance , we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries , but we always needed to fight those who came to UNK us .    3.3469494902284147
we are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term . this is not because we are against european defence , but european defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound , democratically - based decision process in respect of foreign affairs .    3.764415390986011
at the moment , europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of .    3.5464338610718804
i can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level .    3.3133621788021905
in my opinion , it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment , which are such nice toys , after all .    3.833800283401422
i am very sceptical about the fact that commissioner patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further UNK , underdevelopment and conflicts in europe and outside .    3.363895615015143
because our borders do not stop at the mediterranean sea .    2.9854536428598966
mr president , allow me to start with the UNK of kosovo .    3.3476705451765514
it is obvious since the nato bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing , not to promote peace and order but to drive a UNK even further into yugoslavia , to change the borders and to promote the new order .    3.6281550985548683
today , we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of nato occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the serbs and non - albanian speaking minorities .    3.189272582324269
all the signs point towards a second round of attacks on yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the kla attacks on serbs in mitrovica , the attempt to annex three towns in southern serbia to kosovo , the promotion of the independence of kosovo , the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into kosovo via greece , despite the objections of the greek people and , at the same time , intense efforts by nato and the european union to UNK the legitimate government of yugoslavia .    3.7845558756035445
on the other hand , despite his declarations on humanity and peace , it is clear from what mr solana has told us that , according to the helsinki resolutions , we intend to set up a terrorist army , starting with 60 000 men , in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the UNK .    3.6648244591017733
mr solana has confirmed our view that , in a UNK european union , nato will have the UNK hand .    5.682515125767707
that is why this job went to mr solana , the secretary - general of nato , who is also guilty of the crimes committed against yugoslavia ; the right man for the right job , against whom charges have been filed , calling for him to be tried as a war criminal .    3.0431221520576925
commissioner , mr solana , there is no doubt that you are acting quickly and forcefully and that you have made great progress in certain areas .    4.190399346212018
i wonder , and here i do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow members , about the direction in which we are going .    4.5751613873288814
i think that contrary to the great process of economic and monetary union , which was an integrated process within the community structures , today , unfortunately , the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure .    4.139778361067129
my first question , mr solana and commissioner , is to establish whether , together , you have framed strategies that will , at least gradually , lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the community process .    4.365151627039948
we have taken fifteen years to achieve economic and monetary union .    3.196163326972036
we can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy , but the process must be clear .    4.321638294257724
i also believe that we should not underestimate , and this is a question that i put to you , the UNK and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries .    4.584426072733373
we know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the community .    3.380787221263934
today , they would have everything to lose from the UNK of foreign policy , and i believe that they are working with that in mind .    4.818336129149961
finally , with regard to kosovo - mr cohn - bendit was right to emphasise this point - i believe that it is urgent that the european union raise the question of the status of kosovo .    4.414700577449906
without this status , there will only be instability , murders , provocation by belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the european union should come to a decision on this matter .    4.032418171783519
finally , i should like to thank mr poettering because i believe that the belgian initiatives , as we say in common UNK , are getting a bit much .    3.969215453350227
i think many member states among the fourteen other member states would have many reasons not to cooperate in european union meetings on justice , for example .    3.6109621717657956
four years after the arrest of mr dutroux and his associates , we have still not had a trial , and we still do not know what is happening .    3.6549295999241336
as far as tourism is concerned , there will be many people in these fourteen member states who could consider UNK parents of young children from taking holidays in belgium , for example .    3.7986685238483577
so the time has come and i would ask mr solana and mr patten to tell mr michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may UNK on him , which is what i hope will happen .    3.9985430868051
mr president , first of all , i would like to warmly congratulate mr solana on this first day of march , for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on european security and defence policy .    3.404649313391651
but i do wonder what his own view is on this .    3.337879349120858
according to the documents , cooperation with the high representative was fruitful .    3.845939748924271
you said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch . you have to admit , it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks .    4.115969250120772
but do you not regret the fact that you do not UNK over them yourself and are not their leading light ?    3.890620431987913
i - and i believe many with me in parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent .    4.0525409517730635
one gets the impression in fact that they both think that the petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the eu defence policy in due course .    3.767325962722658
the treaties also point in that direction , although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a european pillar .    3.6242116337318353
we would then have a voice in nato through this european pillar .    3.0559392613813228
actually , i hear less and less about this .    3.2883911166278184
it seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation , which would work very well .    3.988563421488624
but is there not more to it than that ?    3.4462720023481936
i cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy , nato ' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence .    4.519824579169236
the european pillar does not really function any more as such . europe is not venturing beyond the petersberg tasks .    3.2507002375015506
is this actually how we want things done ?    3.0840580902974395
moreover , whilst there may be talk of integrating the western european union into the european union , there is no longer any mention of article v , which is , of course , of direct concern to us . article v touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just petersberg .    3.9942415532163507
will it be omitted ?    3.507980324787399
at the same time , an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets .    3.5933568784889816
i think that this is to be welcomed , but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between petersberg tasks and wider , collective defence tasks .    3.2960476339811917
i wonder how this will develop .    3.2733174401634795
i would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long - term future .    3.0946612234755344
is it necessary to give further attention to this during the igc or will the treaties inevitably set the ball rolling ?    3.421850608712823
i am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy .    3.569047995233651
i do wonder , if turkey were to bring in a UNK , would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy ?    4.027933091165557
that would seem odd to me .    3.1640744357198582
will they also take part in our defence policy ?    3.882951584182867
it is a very interesting position to be in , to say the least .    3.696227822184426
high representative , you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between amsterdam and helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since helsinki , such as the establishment of the three committees and , of course , the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50 - 60 000 - strong military force .    4.014602643581313
i believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who , rightly , are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the intergovernmental conference .    4.137527923953493
a word of warning to the latter : this policy needs substantial democratic UNK .    3.345951877037372
we are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy , and i would therefore ask you , in general terms , of course , whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues : the new , two - level commission - high representative structure ; a clear , practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management .    3.9334934728324993
at this stage , this could include , for example , collaboration between the commission and the political committee , the consolidation of community responsibility for non - military crisis management , the creation of a council of ministers for defence , coordination of the treaty on european union , the nato charter and the weu , the legal personality of the european union , reinforced cooperation in this area as well , parliamentary control and , lastly , financing .    4.172798669426598
do you think that any of these issues could be included , at least in the agenda of the current conference ?    4.107627957092975
mr solana , i am sitting quite close to you , close enough to see your face .    3.936458419352268
i think that you have aged , your face is quite UNK .    3.3422025434722067
it pains me to look at you and i despair on listening to you ; that applies both to what you say about UNK with little soldiers , as mrs maes just put it , and what you do not say .    4.1663092760020675
you bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another UNK of ethnic cleansing in kosovo and yet you have stood up here , while blood is being UNK in kosovo , and you have not said a word about it .    3.823629169516173
you are spanish ; you are from a large country , mr solana .    3.618391677316397
spain and franco were not one and the same .    3.32036955222694
spain maintained its unity , it kept the basque country and UNK and UNK and it did well to do so , because no one identified spain with franco and no one played around with spain ' s unity in the name of a fascist dictator .    3.5705368248195493
today , you are identifying yugoslavia with milosevic and you are playing with UNK , with montenegro and with southern serbia . it is you who has created this mess .    3.8741607536517972
which is why , unless they are accompanied by clear political solutions which respect borders and autonomy and all the democratic guarantees , all these plans on paper will lead to new blood - letting in the balkans .    3.476825372956798
mr solana , the war in kosovo and the continuing crisis , have served to reveal a european public opinion that is aware that defending the fundamental values that gave rise to the european union , throughout the world , should no longer continue to rest solely on the shoulders of the president of the united states of america and that the time has come to share the burden , which our american friends have constantly been demanding since europe became a world economic power .    3.7295902331413213
over the last year , the member states of the union have , naturally , decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in sintra , held the day before yesterday in your presence , has just confirmed the main trends .    3.527918068104203
i have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work .    3.4510961846748627
the first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men , which , as you have said , is likely to be deployed to perform peace - keeping and peace - building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long - term basis , if necessary .    3.444489096561623
for the information of our colleagues , i must say here that the corresponding UNK should be divided into three parts : one third to prepare the mission , one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation , following often difficult UNK for personnel and equipment .    3.313110314307977
this explains why the initial figures given in the press , setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men , is close to reality , which has certainly surprised the UNK .    3.571416147834571
my first question , mr solana , will be simple and more direct , perhaps , than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me .    3.378387965248082
you know the french UNK , ' nothing for nothing ' .    3.4506942621017216
do you really think that the governments of the union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them , apparently at least , have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends .    4.147007270381264
my second question is of a more technical nature , but it is important for the responsibilities of the atlantic alliance and the western european union to be transferred to the european union as UNK as possible .    3.9044479985043647
you have told us , in this regard , that three committees are being set up , a political committee and a security committee , which started up today , and a military committee .    4.265562391948343
you then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the atlantic alliance or associate members of the western european union but which are not members of the european union .    4.2245601078536295
in the operation of the temporary institutions , whose establishment has just been decided , can you tell us , mr solana , what status you intend to confer on the members of the alliance and on the associate states of the weu which , i repeat , are not yet members of the european union ?    4.3928449126490134
could they , for example , have a place , at least as observers , in the different political and security committees or in the military committee ?    5.609933003871722
you know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and i should like to say that i understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion .    4.064348482494882
mr president , secretary - general , as you can tell , the members of this house have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the informal meeting of defence ministers in sintra and its significance in the european integration process in terms of security and defence .    4.227305217058433
thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with mr gil - robles .    2.7590039315987505
however , in terms of foreign policy , i am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements , as some members have said this afternoon , without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against .    4.005076319655211
i will give you an example .    2.4708108463713128
during the recent trip by the president of the european parliament to the middle east , which you mentioned , the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the european union in the on - going peace process in the region .    3.8456717419417403
do you believe that representatives of community institutions and member state governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who , like us , hope to mediate between two opposing parties ?    3.2840133326777914
this house is rather doubtful about this and i am not sure whether you share this doubt .    3.470498384701503
in this respect , as you will know , the european parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the community . this is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the member states but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination .    4.04001629188706
could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative , without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the foreign affairs committee ?    4.1572120139666815
mr solana , it has been said many times in this house that prevention is better than cure .    3.721101276817303
of course it is , but there is no reason why europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful .    3.656735315239733
in any case , it is prevention that i would like to discuss today .    4.2791555377278385
war is threatening to break out again in the gulf .    4.177927769524231
as you know , the iraqi government has refused to abide by united nations resolution 1284 , and this is likely to lead , within the next six or seven weeks , to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .    3.5518187576755538
if this happens , the united states ' government and the british government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention .    4.308111626046427
a visit to iraq and meetings with the iraqi leaders and leading figures , particularly mr UNK UNK , convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the iraqi government to cooperate in enforcing resolution 1284 .    3.6533163360030563
i would like to know what you and europe are doing , mr solana , or what you intend to do in the near future , to stave off this threat of war .    3.4298936213340347
today , we have the chance to prevent it ; tomorrow it may be too late .    3.327588033685571
i would also like to know whether , in this context , it would not be possible to do something to induce the iraqi government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the UNK missing UNK , or to set them free if this is within their power .    3.941170391571764
as we sit here , hundreds of thousands of people are in enormous UNK from the floods in mozambique .    3.0860966965458125
this has not just happened .    3.173251412911468
the flooding has been going for weeks , and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need .    3.955087797051454
the level of practical assistance from the community and from the member states has been pathetic .    5.005084290103846
for a long time , many of us have sounded a warning that the european union was spending too much time on its potentially damaging and essentially political project of establishing military decision - making structures , when instead it should have been concentrating its efforts on the improvement of its civil instruments , particularly for humanitarian intervention .    3.887990287044059
i acknowledge mr patten ' s efforts in this direction , but what a pity that the governments of the member states had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of nato .    3.5479052384010648
of course , there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance , and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many european countries .    3.6336151735181605
these are of long standing , but are being addressed already within nato .    3.2684011019342654
i have not yet heard a convincing security - policy explanation of why the european union needs to establish autonomous , decision - making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the nato structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival nato .    3.985390130660621
after all , the eu member states are either full members of nato or sit around the euro atlantic partnership council table .    3.2447468742184773
nato is largely european .    3.982241887342016
mr president , high representative , commissioner , with regard to the war in chechnya , we have all noted the particularly UNK and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the european union in particular .    3.965070650488391
now , what has happened and what is still happening in chechnya is similar to genocide .    3.775629446924361
how else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants , the UNK and inordinate bombing of towns , villages and districts where , in amongst the whole of the civilian population , there are perhaps a handful of chechen fighters ?    3.7648338405997412
how should we describe the sinister filtration camps , which are comparable to concentration camps , in which the population is suffering the most dreadful UNK and from which able - UNK men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive ?    3.433292002444576
how can we describe the UNK , the looting , the deliberate UNK , the UNK , which are called " cleansing " , that recall the worst episodes of the middle ages in europe ?    4.086011218381809
and what can we say about the UNK UNK that is UNK down on russian and international journalists and with the UNK of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres ?    4.331907734016814
if that is realpolitik , if we really do not have any means , mr solana , as high representative of the cfsp , and commissioner , i put this question to you both , let us at least use the means that we do have , namely , the aid programmes to russia .    4.368041949177728
the war in chechnya proves , if proof were necessary , that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers .    3.7803735138729784
let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the russian federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war , to the exclusion of any other objective .    3.610925123486621
mr high representative , you have spoken to us of the progress made to date in relation to the decisions taken at helsinki .    3.672972805108623
some of us here are passionately in favour of creating a UNK european security organisation to defend peace in the world .    3.973986548011897
of course we recognise the role of the security council , as the helsinki resolutions clearly state , in maintaining international peace and security .    3.7888967290833553
however , we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the security council , as referred to at helsinki , was contested recently .    3.652924798754577
the point is : does the political will exist to grant real administrative autonomy to this mechanism , which will cover the entire spectrum of petersberg decisions ?    3.4752010886818834
what about the infrastructures ?    3.3781040617723868
is there some sort of provision which will allow the system as a whole to have this administrative autonomy ?    4.012044561614197
secondly , what will happen to the european defence industry which , after all , comes under the more general activities relating to this system ?    4.0468987908332865
finally , if the treaty needs to be amended , how do you think this amendment will be implemented , following the report to be submitted in feira ? how will it be incorporated into the more general procedure for amending the institutional framework of the treaty and how do you think this will fit in with the possibility of a system of qualified majority voting ?    4.197860799549461
has any thought been given to the matter ?    4.393451852191451
has it been discussed ?    3.6167333009359446
and to what extent has collaboration between you and the relevant commissioner brought about concrete results and created some sort of framework strategy as to how you and the commissioner hope this system will prove truly efficient ?    3.8290915905599987
mr president , i seem to recall from my study of european history , that the UNK convention of sintra was a controversial peace agreement which probably UNK rather than shortened the UNK wars and nearly cost the UNK of UNK his job .    3.529298733695479
i hope this is not an omen for this sintra agreement .    3.572187758605173
that said , i would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far .    4.3741537624443385
but it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters , and the real test of the european defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity , rather than nicely formulated institutions .    4.632229841412444
and , to that end , i am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation , or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity , particularly given the american statements that they are not giving intelligence to europeans until they can deal with security .    4.04047318013361
we have all heard some of the tales emanating from the council of ministers building in brussels .    3.705295947343222
to what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure , because some member states spend considerably more than others .    3.830444657468152
and indeed , some member states are not geared for mobility .    3.566355955821336
can i perhaps also turn to mr patten as well and ask , in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing , to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long - term conflict - causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream eu policies , particularly in development , because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right .    4.195684068015129
and finally , can i also endorse mrs schroedter ' s comments that we do need to have a parliamentary dimension in this defence development .    4.085534951289653
we cannot leave it simply to governments .    3.1311948791813884
i strongly support the decisions taken at sintra .    3.3968198898194086
they constitute a significant step towards establishing an effective european security and defence policy .    3.1365287686954
the creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving eu policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction .    3.4522471601502893
however , while all these developments are indeed welcome , i would like to address a matter which i have raised in this house on previous occasions .    4.316581329446895
i am anxious to know how effective the eu ' s policy planning and early warning unit has been .    3.1083234455860103
while commissioner patten ' s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in mozambique will be opportune , i would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information .    3.2245319492748012
would the high representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit , which has been strongly supported by the committee of which i and mr titley are members , assisted in providing early information , analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves ?    4.5286233589637535
i would also like to support mr titley ' s comments on an effective role for the parliament in this whole area .    3.1762323791301035
when mr solana last spoke to this parliament i was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention ; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention , but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way .    3.81223369852923
we have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year , but we currently have crises in europe and on the borders of europe and elsewhere which this union is failing UNK to deal with .    4.267383287358404
what we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations .    3.706083093504756
we have not heard any information from mr solana about what UNK is going to be used in relation to russia and chechnya .    3.537140456008975
we have not heard anything from mr solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the european union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in chechnya .    3.354613767291138
we have large gaps in what we are arguing for , in principle , in relation to human rights .    4.040156679856472
we UNK the capacity to intervene in relation to kosovo , and we are now making a complete mess of kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention .    3.7329171232557012
so , i would ask mr solana to explain to this house the position of the european union in relation to chechnya .    4.74084972191831
what are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end ?    3.4397007412513343
we have UNK we can use with russia if we choose to use them , but we are choosing not to use them .    3.7469564865844394
mr president , high representative , commissioner , i have two questions for you , mr solana . how , with credibility , are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the member states are not prepared to comply with common commitments ?    3.889756306602011
meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .    4.805279966769483
i also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper .    3.3377585369570073
if we look around , the reality is that the cfsp is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk . take , for example , germany ' s defence savings .    3.4707412101883333
these are not only of concern to the defence minister , mr scharping . instead , they also affect the whole of europe .    3.8218231292060443
in my own country , sweden , the objective , and the commitment towards playing our part , is to supply 2 500 men for eu operations .    3.693179651519501
in the present situation , the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men , due to reduced defence spending .    3.2971059937168867
if we translate this number into figures for the eu countries as a whole , which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place , we shall not have 60 000 men but , at best , 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003 .    4.154202309244245
my second question concerns the following matter . some weeks ago , you were evidently UNK in the german - speaking media , whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters .    3.1603334843513733
i should like , however , to know the background to this , namely whether , as high representative , you have been UNK at all with the idea of giving austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and , if so , on whose mandate and with how much leeway .    3.956470108178461
i am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the high representative .    3.713278680158366
i will not detain the parliament for long but perhaps i could make one or two points and begin , which is sometimes rather dangerous in any parliament , by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality .    3.598160385214303
mrs pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail i think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow .    3.552773623952807
i would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject .    2.832055770150688
i spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the nato parliamentary assembly and members of this parliament .    3.5061658830504268
many of you were there on that occasion and i think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a UNK among many of the nato parliamentary delegates when we spoke about europe ' s ambitions in the area of cfsp .    4.500486005415348
this was particularly true with some of the american delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well .    3.8349045266297934
as i said in my remarks , i felt when i was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to UNK or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the high representative ' s remarks today were extremely encouraging .    4.271886960908991
   3.7318943719743674
we have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time , but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves , for example , facing up to difficult questions about resources .    3.94240429555987
many people will argue that of course all that is required in europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but i suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the member states about whether that really is enough , about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own union .    4.82114834043347
i would just like to say a word about the non - military aspects of our security policy , of conflict prevention and crisis management .    2.9961423588360563
rightly , the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non - military side either and mozambique reminds us of the importance of UNK that .    4.1939416800318785
we will be bringing forward to the council before lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required , not in months or years , but in days or weeks .    4.158964893062942
we are establishing a commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative ' s policy unit .    3.129903351272721
additionally , and this is for me the most important area of all , an area where we are breaking new ground , we will , soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility , be bringing forward proposals as well on non - military headline goals .    4.370316298789555
it is , i repeat , breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in kosovo , policing elsewhere , is the most dramatic and obvious example .    4.3143549894244115
i grew up as a kid hoping i would be allowed to stay up on saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community UNK called UNK of UNK green .    4.276165364687348
i have just been writing a report before i came to this job , and writing a very good report , just to respond to my honourable friend , on policing in part of my own country .    3.4628639496886504
i remember talking about community policing to some american police experts and saying ' what in your view is the ideal community police officer ' and the reply was ' a black grandmother ' .    3.019761254819893
but that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in kosovo .    3.3809997728791656
we have armed forces , we have all got experience of training community police officers .    3.6662630901717375
what is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing .    3.2453710094486348
we need somebody who has the ability to UNK crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well .    3.4074919893990425
that is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the european union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences .    4.560201334647353
so again , rhetoric and reality .    2.9763536992669737
but perhaps i could just say one or two things this afternoon .    3.5449985017786045
i think there is an UNK cord between neglecting human rights , between neglecting UNK corpus , between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance , between tyranny and between environmental degradation .    3.3219471576557673
all those things come together .    3.1913679232228063
we talk about the complexities of our eco - system but there is an eco - system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the balkans as well .    3.582055837365282
so , in the coming months , we will be producing communications from the commission , for example , which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises .    4.709141425078719
we will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this parliament feels passionately about , that is , how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as UNK and UNK as possible without UNK the integrity of the institutions which do it .    3.7957024098332193
we will be producing a communication on anti - personnel landmines , actually the use of UNK equipment .    3.028366217328108
the work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in mozambique .    3.8091230826883775
they have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the UNK , they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools .    3.221834600173025
what does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days , moving those anti - personnel mines around ?    3.2576367541653064
we are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise .    3.435530280085637
what we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that UNK with our policies elsewhere .    4.10462684620994
we have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti - personnel landmines in ukraine , in moldova , the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks , the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks , the political consequences of dealing with those stocks .    2.967797360335856
so the point i want to make is that all these things are intimately related .    3.854244387998454
we have all the instruments , we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the high representative and i face in the next four or five years .    4.479835681829207
now , i hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric .    4.197111909600059
we all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and i will tell you three of them - bosnia , albania , kosovo .    3.2774854723674682
   3.7318943719743674
those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics , quite a few american politicians , quite a few UNK and UNK who say ' how can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep ? ' .    3.4555377496859117
so the big test for us is going to be in the balkans . i hope that all those heads of government , all those prominent politicians in our member states who promised the earth in the balkans , who promised marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the balkans .    4.075023877254272
i would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the european council , the general affairs council and ecofin .    4.136386741825401
all on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver .    4.167367126521703
in the last few months in this job i have heard promises that we will do more in latin america , i have heard promises that if there is a middle east peace settlement , we will be there to pay for it .    3.9482631500734904
i have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern UNK .    3.1818718011817584
i have heard promises that we will secure democracy in indonesia by giving more assistance to indonesia    3.0661898720970613
where is the beef ?    2.5578648688567465
and that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy .    4.042942575890363
that is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view .    4.5202961607386
one reason why i am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that i do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality , the response is ' UNK but we know you are not running things efficiently , we know that you have not spent all your commitments , we know there is some money in your back UNK ' .    3.8477399819468356
i want us to be in a position in which we can say : ' it is not like that any more . we are running things as efficiently and competently as we can ' .    4.813300850663078
so , member states , we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between council conclusions , between UNK of UNK and what we can actually deliver on the ground and i think that if we can achieve that the job of the high representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better .    4.532075559486452
thank you very much , commissioner patten .    2.033338651678401
women in the decision - making process    3.6238709219199525
the next item is the declarations by the council and the commission on women in the decision - making process .    2.8052691452463843
mr president , two centuries ago , during the french revolution , a very famous woman , UNK de UNK , was executed and proclaimed mad because she had supported equal rights for men and women .    3.166795679321529
two centuries later , we have achieved a great deal in europe .    4.615562100760399
the last century was marked by three periods .    3.1067870773700195
this was followed by a second period , in which the worth of female models was recognised .    3.3631474707655356
prime ministers , members of parliament , ministers , in the professional arena , doctors , lawyers , UNK , UNK .    4.826952377981545
we are now in a third period : in this third period , the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed .    3.5050648275940905
the composition , or rather the change in composition , will also bring about changes in policies - policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes .    3.7876588222858687
ladies and gentlemen , the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events : the first was the election of the president of finland , mrs UNK .    3.7335500559433283
and a woman was elected .    3.1881163637073873
the second event took place in france , which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in april 1999 at the ' women and men in power ' conference , at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio .    3.7110712976305082
we must congratulate prime minister jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner .    2.8731601845238264
a great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the member states .    3.630337941231649
but the figures tell the true story .    3.138410499173375
and the figures still give europe cause for concern .    2.839525883264878
24 % of members of government are women and there are an average of 22 % in parliament , although this UNK from 6 % in some member states to as many as 40 % in others .    4.644678638840323
the number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small .    3.0739552631581173
even in countries such as germany and belgium , which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes , the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18 % .    3.986320821725219
what we need , therefore , is to promote specific policies .    4.028428711319323
we need a policy mix which includes long - term political commitments , as in sweden and finland ; they now have governments in which women account for 56 % and 44 % of members respectively .    3.4036780715054338
we need organisation and statistical monitoring .    3.091458989285024
we need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture , UNK and specific problems of each area .    3.496166962720871
increasing the number of women or , as the french prime minister put it , increasing the influence of women in the decision - making centres , is the best way of renewing the policy , of UNK the approach to the question , of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience : the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up .    4.001286073793029
the recent initiative by the finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision - making centres is extremely important .    2.804345190495934
these indicators include national parliaments , regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every member state .    3.3373337459062773
i think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets , compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool .    3.6882065083688063
although legislative measures and institutional intervention by member states have been effective as far as the decision - making centres of the parties in power is concerned , the same cannot be said for the private sector .    3.9487384016165312
my contacts with large european and multinational companies in europe have brought tragic results to light .    3.224029028835403
there are companies at european level which employ thousands of workers , sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2 % of the directors and managers are women .    3.577719099624749
nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision - making centres .    3.1323500847435195
here too , specific efforts will be made of course ; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature , but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices ; in all cases , my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results .    3.612567666589403
as you know , europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within .    3.1919303095679723
a decision has already been taken on quotas of 40 % for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes .    3.4090471753802083
it was approved by the house in may 1999 , when the need for women in research and technology was stressed .    4.5654025276890255
we in the commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the commissioners are working together , as can be seen from the reform of the commission , to achieve 40 % representation of women on all the committees of the european commission .    4.6370513668412405
ladies and gentlemen , there are often objections , UNK - progressive objections , as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power .    3.1440601529909897
no one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say .    3.5479264339628447
and at the level of the european union , the question of whether the 15 member states need to be represented on every committee will never be asked .    4.513415576707302
why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population .    3.247145559015387
i should like to be absolutely categorical .    3.422405839094003
there should be no reservation , no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power .    2.3355005397175095
( applause )    2.1317664315829634
women make up half the population , half the strength of the planet .    3.4849580358692345
excluding women from the centres of power means , first , democratic failure and , secondly , under - exploitation of human resources .    3.751324281310929
we face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles .    3.501365887569062
the bet before us is a bet with time .    3.3100332255933433
future generations of women must not be sidelined .    4.103743790997178
if need be , we must use all possible means to force the situation .    3.939332620290783
mr president , firstly i must thank mrs UNK UNK for taking part in this debate and for her interesting speech on the subject .    3.4100796383771788
i must also thank the commissioner for being here and for her words .    3.750086762301313
the various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under - represented in the decision - making process , in both the political and the economic and social spheres .    3.5144328330933936
nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life , in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved .    4.517726412554779
the equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work . this involves both equality in accessing work , which implies equality in training , and equal pay for the same work , so often defended and yet far from being achieved .    3.679617961632494
we are convinced that the participation of women in the decision - making process will be beneficial to society as a whole .    2.749379975950389
women always have a different viewpoint from men . this serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us , who are dedicated to active politics , undertake to solve .    3.5401859629411456
the difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making .    3.734015529159277
in some countries of the european union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women .    3.418270733558929
however , this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men .    3.3918245888215366
women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent .    3.498280421587623
the real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women .    3.9760225380418333
there must also be a clear and real will to allow more women , who are ready and able , to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision - making process .    3.6304522468856035
there is no clear agreement within the ppe - de group in support of the compulsory quota system .    3.1241756319736202
some members have even come out against this .    3.3095318111952268
personally , i would not want to feel like a quota , to think that i was in a particular job because i was a woman .    4.7336176254494315
this is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference .    3.8119574419123015
mr president , i should also like to thank the president - in - office of the council and the commissioner for good speeches on their part which i think provide hope for real optimism , especially given the will and commitment UNK by both women .    3.03827140994305
i think it was an excellent example the commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the european union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women .    3.9084244483108685
it could hardly have been made more abundantly clear , what we are concerned with here .    4.1516002400501595
i do hope that the commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the commission - but then , of course , she is young and full of energy .    4.0845516733894085
i am convinced that it will be hard work , when all is said and done .    2.9098568268749636
we have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the commissioner can implement her views on equality .    3.823578948456332
i would say to the portuguese minister that i completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power .    3.825027356240195
that is absolutely crucial .    3.3529281480757773
it should also be remembered , however , that no one voluntarily UNK power , and that applies to both men and women .    3.8133025054526417
men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them , but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power , and i am thinking here , in particular , of positions of power in relation to children .    4.7209337067498796
moreover , i would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today .    4.074216778527921
inevitably , we should like , for the same reasons of power politics , to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves .    5.338318297201057
what i want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides ' surrendering power .    4.299438820689394
the commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly - based political mix , and she specifically mentioned finland and sweden .    3.246979683713975
just for the record , i would say that she might well also have mentioned denmark .    4.095046081052924
and i say that , of course , because i come from denmark .    5.489298037188941
in fact , 45 % of the danish government is made up of women , and that is , in reality , a touch more than in finland .    4.437412442052991
we still do not have a female president but , on the other hand , we have a UNK , and that must no doubt , in certain contexts , amount to the same thing .    4.167455240494105
i should like to UNK some of the points the commissioner mentioned , notably the question of financial resources .    4.319826798480722
it is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term .    3.8186707530661153
in the short term , we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and , of course , also properly educated .    3.4617507216247976
the issue is therefore one of appropriate structures .    3.108987586213023
one might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing , and i am therefore very happy that the portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the lisbon summit , which is , of course , to be partly concerned with it developments .    3.823385125226777
i think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women , specifically because it is characterised by flat , rather than hierarchical , structures .    3.413366474476358
in denmark , we have , in any case , seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up .    4.940325769911632
there are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which i should just like to mention here finally .    3.8265855814731116
the first is the issue of the media ' s influence .    3.047901525078701
i think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish .    3.135488362095525
i have to say that i do not know the precise answer to that question .    2.878068186456179
i have a suspicion that this is the case , but i am not certain .    5.399416062442544
the second point is the enlargement of the union .    2.638854932164208
i think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well , specifically that the new member states should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned .    4.596633701345951
i would also like to thank the minister and the commissioner for their statements and i agree with the commissioner ' s statement ; it is time that fine words were translated into action .    3.343619239080979
we all know to what extent women are under - represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves .    3.722961329311338
it is systematic monitoring which will reveal this .    3.0583479799002617
mainstreaming is a long - term commitment and process .    4.096143165964149
in the meantime , we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures .    4.076532765938445
we can learn from the successes mentioned , not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected , but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system .    3.8642678128386683
i am pleased to say that in wales , which i represent , 40 % of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but , on the other hand , we have only 4 women mps from wales in the house of commons which is only 10 % of the total ; so statements of principle , of support in principle , are not enough because they have not worked .    4.037470139230176
if we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen .    4.352460427290098
mr president , at the second international conference of socialist women held in copenhagen in 1910 , it was decided that the main demand of the time , that of a woman ' s right to vote , should be linked to the women ' s question as a whole and that ( as also stated in the relevant resolution ) women ' s day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for .    3.8856904364471943
it is also worth noting that international women ' s day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years .    3.2169277451392992
in 1910 , a woman ' s right to vote was on the agenda .    3.022706668603045
today , we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision - making process .    3.149687835538565
women are no homogenous collective .    3.1056540161751975
women belong to different social classes .    3.250599989479412
women have different individual needs and interests .    3.3085387322315527
irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class , race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work , it is nonetheless a fact that , in all areas of society , the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men ( albeit with a few individual exceptions , it is perhaps best to add ) .    4.29139028114318
in my own country , sweden , a number of political parties have , in recent years , voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run .    3.0287325912887173
this has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which , in turn , has provided opportunities for further research .    3.2963930102145875
what happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making ?    3.185945083157016
what has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes , so too of course do the types of decisions made .    3.8759620058239856
when the talk turns to quota allocation by gender , the word " qualifications " also crops up .    2.7729586012110077
what is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined .    3.265506788984394
it often looks as if men today , as in the past , always have the least defined qualifications .    4.035796689359108
being a man therefore seems , in itself , to be synonymous with maximum competence .    3.9619675313322675
this way of seeing things i consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today ' s decision makers .    4.010138397983263
earlier this year , we requested , here in this chamber , that 8 march be made into an international holiday .    3.7562054926063526
in anticipation of this request being met , i now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the " women ' s world UNK " which are to begin this spring on international women ' s day .    3.438806648036373
this is a world - wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world .    2.9472470342433565
finally , i want to say , as commissioner patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close , that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother .    3.760718073359117
we do not have any such officers , but black UNK are in fact to be found .    3.3672690270375987
mr president , the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to UNK each other in terms of political correctness .    4.096421954355853
undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics .    3.884101711717918
it is not absolutely certain that the UNK of men in the party machinery alone is responsible .    3.9671892261330974
in the authorities of the french departments , the leading french party is that of independent elected representatives , in right - wing or left - wing categories .    3.70473092554009
in order to be elected as a local UNK , you just have to want to be elected .    3.705055773307406
but access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local UNK .    3.142611567139466
our group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the european union .    3.278991106356869
that is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination , whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities .    3.8350846023724903
the policy of minorities , while neglecting the deep - seated unity of the human family , to establish superficial divisions , is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system .    3.8746117181102093
on the one hand , if we establish quotas for women , why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group , quotas of catholics , of workers , of those who wear UNK .    3.5162199153309017
the establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more UNK than establishing quotas of women .    4.049285722075739
with such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative UNK .    3.7274686631797382
it would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation .    3.3790175397119273
the policy of quotas can only increase the UNK of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs .    3.765254595363371
on the other hand , such a policy shows a deep contempt for women .    3.0270679640425646
a woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised .    3.406060844060758
ladies , have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the UNK of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota ?    3.727850244061102
women deserve more than a quota .    4.017581763253358
minister , commissioner , everything you have just said has been very well expressed , even if a few male colleagues , if there are still any in the chamber , perhaps UNK their teeth .    4.602388657776415
i know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action , because they believe that this positive discrimination UNK them and marks them forever in their careers .    3.699478423313257
but the statistics prove it : the positive action , even the quotas , - if they are not applied blindly , without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision - making process .    3.2116538796775678
that is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas , as a transitional measure , contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women , particularly in political life .    3.748292476901342
i should like to take this opportunity to remind the commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas .    3.338303516472548
first of all it concerns our report , which was adopted last year on the occasion of international women ' s day in strasbourg , which requests the commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women .    4.127602913608879
according to the treaty of amsterdam , there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right , and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically .    3.732393884626531
things being what they are , nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society , requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures , including positive action .    3.804552367981494
therefore , commissioner , you can go ahead .    4.140204361753507
you do not need to wait for a new amendment to the treaty .    4.358915974509755
may i just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and UNK with regard to the equal treatment of self - employed people , including assistant spouses .    3.7911239431742834
here again , commissioner , the ball is in your court .    4.002514767253884
do not take too long to send it back .    3.599934392083189
i would like to thank the minister and the commissioner for their speeches and for UNK themselves before the european parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today .    3.4252253862077735
the presence of women in decision - making bodies , in particular , is a question of democracy .    4.486031642257248
all citizens , both men and women , should be able to see , to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule .    4.56627637708799
if we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision - making bodies , it is clear that we are still far from true democracy .    4.370176933036478
however , it is also a question of political agendas .    3.3049612677910316
in addition to making up the majority of the population , women are also the most dynamic element in society : it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in europe in recent years ; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men , and in many of our regions , they are the main feature of the innovation , training , performance and flexibility development model .    3.9021708854360844
out of a sample of women who work in and around milan , where i live , 90 % said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day .    3.9348146581813026
women work an average of 60 hours a week , which is 20 hours longer than men .    3.857966498050893
the price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time .    3.265655188244747
if this is true , and it is , any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point .    4.052386321629296
laws , programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well - constructed , coordinated and UNK , in order to encourage the formation of new cultural , economic , social , institutional and political ruling classes whose UNK is characterised by the involvement of women .    3.8216262203236964
much has been achieved on many issues in europe , but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation .    4.583717873051257
i agree with the commissioner that it is time for the european political sphere - the entire european political sphere - to represent women and men on an equal footing , and for decisive action to be taken in this matter .    3.984025032090762
mr president , before i came here for today ' s sitting , i was watching finnish television .    3.393599736772918
in finland , an honorary company of the finnish army was UNK the new president of the republic , with the words " good morning , madam president . "    4.228840101032887
you perhaps know that , in finland , the president is not just the leading public figure or political leader , but she is also commander - in - chief of the armed forces , so this was quite an interesting and historic occasion .    4.172738434380473
during the finnish presidential term , a report was produced that reveals an image of the whole decision - making process , and , on the basis of this report , i hope that the commissioner proposes legally binding ways of improving the position of women in decision making .    4.282060186396292
i urge you all , women of the right , to listen to mrs lulling , because she told us why quotas were needed and , if any of us has sufficient experience of political life , it is she .    4.088075451553596
i appeal to you , ladies and gentlemen , not to vote in favour of the proposal tomorrow to moderate the contents of point 4 , to prevent gender democracy from being discussed at the intergovernmental conference .    3.5415268953977335
we know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve , both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility .    3.50589208742681
the truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy .    3.0961384705953434
it is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the council , the commission and each member state strictly to respect the commitments they have made , particularly at the beijing conference .    4.338692067776311
quite simply , i would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and i am particularly against the system of quotas , because i believe it is especially UNK of women and i come from a country where UNK has just been achieved .    4.9136474143623445
it is quite logical , it is consistent !    4.310217534399444
it should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50 % , if not more , of those within decision - making bodies and , inter alia , in the political arena .    3.9372963544236557
so , there should be no positive discrimination to include women .    3.1769699655374235
woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense .    3.624757140830959
when i see that we are asking for training for women in politics , i want to say - no , definitely not .    4.630900260909878
let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics - but why especially compel women to undergo training ?    2.830891521604129
that simply amounts to UNK their UNK .    3.864268691793764
so i believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow UNK to achieve decision - making power , to gain responsible posts in the political arena , but i believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think .    3.9391853878423744
we shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women ' s participation in the political decision - making process .    3.1610358539090044
mr president , minister , commissioner , " women are half of heaven " , a successful man once said .    3.468379868722961
but when it comes to important decisions and priorities , there is a lack of women ' s voices .    4.194692153460168
women , who constitute more than half of the population , are heavily under - represented within political , economic and social fields .    3.779439343676128
that is unacceptable in a democracy .    3.5054498119481887
where equality is concerned , the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making .    3.5736378791228693
if we are to achieve a balance , a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required .    3.340853667579514
an important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women ' s full participation in power structures and decision making .    3.6862455699728076
i am therefore delighted that the commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind .    3.2931413175531983
i propose that the eu ' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the UNK - out achievements of the three most successful member states within each area , with the member states each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated .    4.357263998403928
women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape , sexual offences , domestic violence and the trade in women , but they are under - represented on the legal and legislative bodies which UNK upon these crimes .    3.3558400324406343
the latter are consequently accorded low priority , and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted .    3.801679957230793
women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under - represented in peace - keeping efforts , conflict resolution and reconstruction work .    2.938665522745301
in the resolution , we therefore urge the member states to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace - keeping .    4.48195731747106
the call for women ' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy ; it is also essential if women ' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full .    3.869716779405065
women should not only be " half of heaven " but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet .    3.6286820832072384
mr president , i would like to congratulate the president - in - office of the council and commissioner diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today .    2.7050571252325946
we have high hopes for what you will achieve .    3.307072816237125
we are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to UNK decision - making positions .    3.500345276221317
furthermore , we want values that women consider important , such as peace , fraternity , equality , justice , security and environmental protection , to be the guiding spirit for life in the european union and , if possible , throughout the world .    4.397467063705143
in order to achieve this , women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has , until now , been essentially UNK with masculine values .    3.530134349231119
we know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for .    3.295056107390084
let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory : not over men , not over anyone , but the victory of equality between men and women .    3.402387014855836
we therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities , and the great challenge confronting all europeans now , and particularly women , concerns the new economy and the new information technologies .    3.9323890799503802
the lisbon summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women .    3.8613941956698987
the rate of employment in europe , which is much lower than in the united states and japan , must be increased .    4.746014985983709
we must therefore have many more women in work , and working in the new jobs in which the eu has a UNK .    4.628863789719287
i would therefore like to ask the council and the commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming lisbon summit to ensure that the new economy and the new europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women .    3.6695761574807255
mr president , commissioner , the reason why i was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the member states where the political representation of women is a success , such as , for example , in finland , france and sweden , and equally , you had the courage to list the member states where things in this respect are not going so well , such as , for example , my own country and greece too , which you forgot to mention .    3.6510929583135012
moreover , i have heard that for the next elections , it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in greece .    3.928831046683635
i think this is a very sad state of affairs .    2.9032625064807864
i appreciate your courage because i think that it is high time that we in the european institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda .    4.193959259145614
this is why i think it is important that this parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution .    3.8459395672048746
i myself , commissioner , am a product of quotas . i do not believe that any of the meps will be able to prove that i am any less competent as a result .    4.839162101087404
it appears that the meritocracy in a number of our european countries is still so biased in favour of UNK that women simply do not stand a chance .    3.8218688525989997
it is true that a number of countries in the european union have already introduced quotas , and you yourself made reference to belgium , commissioner , where it has not really taken off .    4.494219918461559
hardly surprising , would you not agree , mrs avilés perea , not because we failed to find the necessary candidates , but because recent scientific research , instigated by the commission , has shown that quotas are , in fact , only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats .    4.154711440125922
this is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas .    3.0055418082124667
indeed , minister , we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract .    3.938180265850161
but we should draw the necessary conclusions from this .    3.1919367393287192
the electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one - for - one system , as is being applied in sweden on a voluntary basis .    3.9103039652544047
i would suggest the following : where possible , apply it on a voluntary basis , where there is reluctance , impose it .    3.394801580656116
i hope that in the fifth action programme , minister and commissioner , benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through , for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this .    3.888850824559473
mr president , i too should like to congratulate the commissioner and the president - in - office of the council for their solid recommendations and , above all , for their proposals .    3.1181754399100963
because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women ' s rights , i thought i might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual , francis UNK , to today ' s debate .    3.471890589332116
in an article entitled " if women ruled the world " , he maintains that if women were more involved in politics , the world would certainly not be so UNK to violence .    3.4008005140866353
UNK , the UNK of wisdom and war , may have been a female model in ancient greece , but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace .    3.8547152620138596
there are , therefore , serious grounds , over and above justice between the sexes , for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and UNK between men and women .    3.0485248822876563
women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue , reconciliation , an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means .    3.2191173591098297
these female virtues can offer an alternative to today ' s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone .    3.347059814437552
that is why the intergovernmental conference must introduce into the treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the european union and in all democratic institutions and political decision - making centres throughout the community .    4.044778952331934
mr president , why do women need their rightful share in political decision making ?    2.927081084679003
and how should we achieve this ?    3.4491185855414783
we all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary .    4.184551997952021
it is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and , as such , a condition for political legitimacy .    3.371119566969663
but if we look into how to achieve this , the opinions are greatly divided .    3.58523571898197
is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment , much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties ?    3.656054582183782
and is it then up to the state , in other words the legislative , to impose such measures on political parties ?    4.569036594859043
or should we even consider a system in which 50 % of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies ?    3.6538089973592
in my opinion , the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level .    2.8972767297973214
i am a great UNK of voluntary quotas on electoral lists , without which , in fact , i would not be here today .    4.150916327879615
like mrs van lancker , i am a product of such a measure .    4.484631864977011
in my opinion , though , the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties , at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself .    3.5219626072967043
in other words , the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid .    3.1396979007800168
we would , in this way , violate democracy .    3.850434877659909
mr president , today ' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision - making bodies and changes to the decision - making system in europe .    3.28407065988416
we have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors , education , work , culture .    3.9551544327191697
the problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision - making centres .    4.634877465314249
the debate is a deeply political one .    2.817248469705601
there are two approaches .    2.937412317498278
the first is a policy of persuasion .    3.118753790349154
gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved .    3.481679991325123
three comments : the first is based on the fact that women are able . i can , therefore all women can .    4.602241561523898
how do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded ?    3.6376473765791526
we are able but the rest of the female population is not ?    3.5068609134742923
here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics . because women have to deal with different realities .    3.705930259910757
because they have fewer opportunities .    3.083361145543765
because they have a different level of education .    3.5779069816818025
because they have to face social obstacles . because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest .    3.9335133483645186
the second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders .    4.423735639071144
not necessary !    3.7390751840176906
they have all been persuaded !    2.753946055717527
there is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women .    3.172256780888501
there is not one party , from the far left to the far right , which does not stress the need for women to take part .    4.050506558182693
on paper !    3.959323760568239
thirdly , we must expect things to change gradually .    3.3586679629518588
the women ' s conference in beijing brought an important point to light .    3.94658384016652
with the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level , it will take 2 , 300 years to achieve a balance between men and women .    3.335546415672525
as far as europe is concerned , as far as the european parliament is concerned , where there is a quota for the involvement of women , it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation .    4.821586870736704
the second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women .    2.656350566661304
quotas alone are not enough .    3.3282809135464433
if only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history .    3.1506308442889397
on this we are clear .    3.4922896004222506
quotas are one of the ways , one of the policies needed to bring about change .    4.963410905497584
finally , on the question of whether , as the product of quotas , we can be proud , i would reply categorically that i would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that i had managed to impose quotas on greece , where the level of representation of women is 5 % .    4.871279900817662
thank you , mrs diamantopoulou .    2.2940007339768114
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow morning .    2.3671290471751014
floods in mozambique    5.473566122866516
the next item is the commission statement on flooding in mozambique .    2.2321158168502735
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission .    2.2909767628058004
the commission is following with very great concern , as i know all honourable members will be , the emergency situation in mozambique .    3.558225127647667
the continuing UNK UNK throughout the southern african region aggravated by the UNK UNK have led to the displacement of large numbers of people and there has been considerable damage to housing and infrastructure .    3.6258189464013553
about 800 000 people appear to have been affected by the floods , about 300 000 are in urgent need of food and other types of humanitarian assistance .    3.6613596886119146
several people have lost their lives , many have disappeared , many have been injured .    3.6295904427457097
the government of mozambique has UNK for humanitarian aid from third countries .    3.4145365223805806
the international community including the united states of america , switzerland , south africa , ireland , norway , denmark , italy , sweden and the netherlands have to date provided substantial assistance .    3.211025291191488
my colleague poul nielson is literally on his way to mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the portuguese secretary of state to assess the situation on the ground .    3.2449524910241245
mr nielson will be happy to report back to parliament on the findings of his mission .    3.245705788798773
just before i say a word about the assistance which has been given by echo so far , perhaps i can be allowed to make three rather personal remarks .    4.007659733967984
first of all , from 1986 to 1989 , i was an overseas development minister and i formed a particular attachment to the people of mozambique .    3.0953598563881615
they were UNK dealing then with huge environmental and political problems , with the problems of poverty and the consequences of a bloody war .    4.28483557479192
if ever a country deserved help from aid donors it was mozambique .    3.0178633575227414
secondly , that feeling has been confirmed by the real efforts which mozambique has made in the last few years to build a strong and prosperous economy and a stable society .    3.4254276606934573
thirdly , we spent much of this afternoon in this chamber discussing conflict prevention , how one could prevent crises happening or how one could respond to crises more effectively .    3.2622475035430774
we talked about the importance of the commission developing a series of headline goals for non - military actions related to crises and , if i may say so , if ever there was a case where that is relevant , it is the disaster which has UNK mozambique .    4.225365749241033
let me turn to the assistance provided so far .    2.9813066114477955
last week echo decided to allocate eur 1 million for flood relief , of which 600 000 will be dispersed through the spanish red cross and 150 000 through UNK luxembourg , for operations in mozambique and eur 250 000 to UNK through the german red cross .    3.0017811087988293
these ngos will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care , water and sanitation .    3.7026492432093603
echo is currently preparing a second decision for a further eur 2 million this decision will be implemented through UNK , action contre la UNK , UNK , UNK UNK and UNK pending , of course , the reception and examination of their final proposals .    3.9083497500496676
these ngos will be concentrating on the areas of water and sanitation , provision of shelter , plastic UNK , UNK UNK , blankets , those sorts of things .    3.487343895786348
they will be concentrating on the UNK of displaced people , on the further prevention of outbreaks of UNK , UNK and other UNK diseases , on the provision of supplementary food to UNK and children at risk , on the provision of seeds and tools , on food security , on the rehabilitation of essential animal health structures and on the training of village livestock promoters .    4.53339861045309
a third decision will be considered in the light of the mission of commissioner nielson .    3.716461724780175
the commission is also preparing a medium - term community response combining ngo co - financing with european development fund operations to help mozambique to respond to the crisis situation in re - establishing the rapid pace of growth that mozambique had worked so hard to achieve .    2.9430489720666033
it is envisaged that this response would link the current phase of emergency through to re - construction within a three to four years time horizon .    2.9917243337864328
at times like this we are all aware of how much more we need to do to prevent disasters and to deal expeditiously with the disasters that we are not able to prevent .    4.485390664072109
i am not sure that i can add very much at this stage to the analysis of what went wrong and what we can do better but obviously we must learn any lessons that are required from this terrible calamity .    3.484498331451558
i repeat , commissioner nielson will be happy to report to parliament when he returns from mozambique and the scene of the disaster .    3.198942909525824
mr president , commissioner , mozambique is a young african country which has made heroic efforts to recover from the underdevelopment resulting from two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy .    2.93439380905502
the credit for mozambique ' s success story must be shared equally by its government , by the opposition , but above all , by the people of mozambique .    4.022583693596216
there is a risk , however , that all the effort that has been made in recent years , after all the problems with the peace agreements , with which we are all familiar , will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on mozambique over the last few weeks .    4.466450307674096
the current figures reaching us on the extent of the disaster are terrifying , as the commissioner has already said : around one million people homeless and more than one hundred thousand on top of roofs or trees , waiting for a UNK to come and save them .    3.776438179730738
there have already been hundreds of deaths .    3.731975827042847
the eu and some of its member states , including my own , have provided emergency financial aid , perhaps a little later than they should have , but they have done so , as have the united states and various countries in the region , particularly south africa .    4.325855012368841
it is now obvious that the main priority is for rescue helicopters , followed immediately by food aid and other emergency humanitarian aid .    3.147186516547462
although these floods began three weeks ago , the whole world has finally begun to wake up to the dire UNK mozambique currently finds itself in : there are thousands of people whose lives are hanging by a thread and who will soon die unless we arrange transport , particularly air transport , to get them out of the situation they are in .    3.768327772911597
this is undoubtedly the greatest priority at the moment : search and rescue transport and emergency humanitarian aid , including food aid .    3.2343510296412106
i would like to emphasise , however , that the eu and the rest of the world must not limit their aid to mozambique to the emergency that we are now discussing .    3.678720911777969
we must be aware of the aftermath of the floods .    3.243382515323224
it is therefore now becoming urgent for us to start considering how we can find financial resources to rebuild the infrastructure that has been destroyed and without which mozambique cannot continue on the path towards development on which it set out a few years ago in such a promising way .    3.951740464990803
rebuilding infrastructure is crucial , because otherwise there can be no development . it is also time for some UNK countries to think about writing off or reducing mozambique ' s debts .    3.8301940485701587
i therefore hope that the visit by commissioner nielson and representatives of the portuguese presidency this week will enable us to treat this extremely important issue with the seriousness it deserves .    3.4814053948263135
although it is currently impossible to UNK how many people have died , we do know that around 80 000 are in imminent danger of drowning and 300 000 have lost their homes and crops .    3.3476941600256054
they urgently need aid such as food , water and shelter in order to survive .    4.206528749622347
however , the aid needed now is difficult to get through , despite the efforts of the ngos , because the roads , bridges and railway lines are damaged .    3.8068683322444863
helicopters are therefore needed .    3.8735580119449002
apparently there are only five at the moment to rescue about 80 000 people from trees .    4.000577153816994
the machinery mobilising the aid is too slow .    3.5507888133906667
the pse group of this house has suggested that preventing natural disasters , including preventing conflicts , is the best way of avoiding situations like the one now being suffered by the people of mozambique .    3.7790031978692196
i must remind you in particular of the efforts of mr rocard during the previous term .    3.7227343022041786
the european commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as dipecho . this was intended to be proactive and , using a regional approach , to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population .    3.6420928393935452
however , africa is surprisingly not included in the dipecho plans .    3.261752096551765
mozambique , which is now suffering a foreseeable disaster , just as the famine now threatening in ethiopia was foreseeable , is excluded from these plans .    3.5446365745769475
this is reasonable and we support this , but we have to ask the commissioner , why not africa ?    4.501319438230475
the pse group has always supported the commission ' s humanitarian aid policy .    4.084887805479526
we have always supported echo , its policies and its actions , even some which have been disputed by certain bodies . we believe that solidarity must be the distinctive feature of the eu ' s external action .    3.964668489871027
in view of all this , we also believe the time has come to demand a UNK effort by the commission and the member states , on behalf of those who are now drowning in mozambique .    4.581194716739733
the eur 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the mozambican government at 65 million dollars .    3.5463121945838254
the time has also come to demand greater efficiency .    3.3306060406443097
we hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon , the commissioner ' s knowledge of the situation in mozambique and the visit by mr nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help mozambique .    3.9999753682679766
mr president , the situation in mozambique is of the greatest urgency .    3.3760478246691825
each day , each hour of delay costs many lives .    3.1572554264754937
there are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims . the water levels continue to rise .    2.9865315228057896
UNK and epidemics seem inevitable .    2.9989236775126615
it is as if the whole world is looking on , UNK .    3.2109647531734424
the question is whether the commission has reacted with sufficient alertness .    3.2612437351097623
i must admit that i have my doubts about this .    3.100678064006733
commissioner nielson is flying out today . in european terms , this may be swift action , but given the emergency in mozambique , this is probably very late .    3.9271568076419894
unlike a number of member states , the european union has promised only very limited aid so far .    4.297334429081664
what options does the commission have , to offer effective help fast ?    3.7932360691298275
what could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of ?    2.971147378171447
can commissioner patten update us on the international coordination so far ?    3.901232954434827
why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner ?    3.513943989227821
the international community could also help mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts , not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy , but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential .    3.4007925614315235
mr president , all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting mozambique .    2.780667073147699
there are thousands and thousands of displaced persons , a large number of dead , a lack of food and drinking water , and homes and crops have been destroyed .    3.4027325012054224
and this is happening in a country which , because it is one of the poorest in the world , does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary .    5.216507628404732
we know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation , representatives of the portuguese presidency and commissioner nielson left today for mozambique .    4.293236169776106
we are pleased about this development , but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium - term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately . this should be done in conjunction with the mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires .    4.094321063702005
furthermore , it was precisely for this reason , and also because i am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action , that i spoke today to commissioner nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as chairman of the committee on development and cooperation . i asked him to join us , as soon as he returns , to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the eu has already taken , and those which we are going to take .    4.080778181109984
thousands upon thousands of human lives are in danger at the moment , and only international solidarity can save them .    3.605501812583639
i would like to think that the eu is up to the task of providing the people of mozambique with what they expect from us .    4.175115304156521
mr president , i would like to begin by emphasising , first of all , the timing and the UNK of this debate on the devastating floods in mozambique .    3.2465246410729716
indeed , these floods and appalling weather have resulted in many thousands of people losing their homes and all of their UNK , people who cannot return to their homes after the storms , purely and simply because their homes and their UNK no longer exist . they are no longer there , having been swept away in the UNK .    3.5121564765919735
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there remains , however , one immediate problem : the need to provide help for all mozambicans who have been afflicted , many of whose lives are in danger , in their flooded villages , hoping that they will be UNK .    3.5299064862295046
as the president of mozambique , UNK UNK , remarked in a dramatic appeal , each passing day may mean death for many mozambicans .    3.7224703600596047
the eu must therefore mobilise resources immediately and effectively , in terms of quantity as well as quality , and it must employ the most rapid and appropriate means of achieving this .    3.928228756402034
it is true that mozambique ' s democracy is still far from perfect , as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them .    3.3448452845427457
but given this situation , which is so tragic for the people of mozambique , we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of mozambique ' s leaders , both those in the government and those in opposition , who , out of a sense of responsibility , have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems .    4.142151007074222
mr president , commissioner , i would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this house ' s attention - which was not really necessary , but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in mozambique . i have some figures here , which i believe are the most up - to - date ones available .    4.143454607955303
more than three hundred people have already died , six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced , two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off , with UNK - five thousand needing to be UNK , some of whom are in UNK , others on roofs .    3.3949440476946404
as has already been said , helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid . otherwise , apart from the tragedy created by the floods , the next tragedy will arise : that of a lack of aid to the people , who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods .    4.037564568849642
this would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all .    3.1891659730943664
the commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with mozambique , as i have myself , and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake .    3.936667611194492
i hope that the mission by commissioner nielson and the portuguese state secretary will provide the information that this house needs in order to understand the current situation , and what the most urgent needs are , so that we can help the people of mozambique , who genuinely deserve our help , in their struggle for development .    4.054414666143465
.    2.4274255028413507
could i thank commissioner patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said , the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken UNK valley in mozambique are absolutely UNK .    3.363057480219712
children have lost parents , families are bereft , hopeless , helpless and they have lost absolutely everything .    3.3086344845167335
but of course , as others have said , this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate , woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness .    3.2717562718880133
there is a case as the commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the UNK preparations in place .    3.97351359053814
this morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the gaza region .    3.3762142042705956
the save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet .    3.158383798691338
85 % of the work is within an hour of UNK so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is .    4.879152276619077
also i would like to say commissioner that european citizens want to know exactly what echo is doing .    4.115445326402074
most of us here would not wish to boast about eur 3 million .    3.582521438349433
we need far more and i hope that the commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there .    4.19515548931143
clearly also we need to see a massive UNK .    4.8511563004302225
as you say tons of food , water purification equipment , UNK , blankets .    3.912079857411291
are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources .    3.3186640148792113
are we ready to pay for those resources ?    3.507400829844284
mozambique is , of course , one of the poorest countries in the world , but one of africa ' s great success stories with its work on economic growth , on poverty reduction , on democracy in spite , of course , of massive debt pressures .    3.952817561192666
mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured .    3.476862426142785
how badly the disaster sets mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country .    3.394347725800643
thank you , mrs kinnock .    2.7717278898654403
mr nogueira , we note your interest and concern about this subject but your group is not down to speak and i must abide by the rules of procedure .    3.4668254348447527
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
union economy ( 1999 )    4.571304473629104
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0041 / 2000 ) by mr katiforis , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission document ' the eu economy 1999 review ' [ c5 - UNK / 2000 - 2000 / UNK ( cos ) ] .    2.466363420611661
the report of the commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the european economy which it finds promising , especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8 % by the year 2001 .    4.906720889951512
this picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of UNK , of growth of only 1 . 9 % per year throughout the 1990s , despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were , however , unable to consolidate .    4.0196790080023375
it would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to UNK themselves , we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self - sustained higher growth levels in our economy .    3.7860047430825694
this is the challenge .    3.175652024775888
faced with this challenge the commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal UNK of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents .    3.3028712058557352
in europe , in your rapporteur ' s opinion , this is exactly the attitude that has served us badly over past years , not just once but repeatedly .    4.465321617415414
such an attitude has UNK risks which i understand the ecofin council is currently discussing .    3.493979489163829
these risks involve a correction in the us economy and the future trend in oil prices and in long - term eu interest rates .    3.599402728911606
should any of these risks materialise in a negative fashion , what will be our response - more UNK UNK or shall we have prepared ourselves better than in the last downturn ?    4.033157842335269
it has been my proposal that parliament must recommend an UNK economic policy consisting of two main parts .    3.0172806957081413
one is to adopt the commission ' s own excellent , outstanding UNK analysis , and ask the council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected UNK targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible .    3.797208167246426
a central plank of such a programme should be the raising of the level of investment of capital formation from 19 % , to which it has fallen over the decade , to at least 23 - 24 % of gdp , both in the private and in the public sector .    4.268128214777665
to allow the public sector to take the necessary significant lead in investment policy , the council would indeed have to sacrifice some of its most UNK cows .    4.595540233999109
it would need to revise its negative attitude towards the big infrastructure programmes of trans - european networks , which have been gathering dust in the UNK for rather too long , to allow them to be financed on an adequate scale by means of european community bonds and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficits which would allow governments to UNK for purposes of investment without falling foul of the restrictions of the stability pact .    3.712519264396498
this was the first pillar of my recommendation .    3.163809694023142
the second pillar consisted of embracing a large number of structural reforms , privatisation , de - regulation proposals , as well as suggestions facilitating the transition to a knowledge - based economy which , as we know , constitutes the backbone of the proposals of the presidency for the lisbon summit .    3.7413002529981116
it has been repeatedly stated by expert opinion that the programme of structural reforms combined with an UNK programme of investment and growth is capable of pulling the european economy out of its state of inertia while one - sided policies are condemned to fail .    3.5326123987661098
i am glad that at least after five years of insistence they have found the target of full employment acceptable but i must say that simply referring to full employment without proposing a concrete programme towards achieving the targets smacks too much of lip service and is too UNK to serve as the political message of optimism that people expect from us , have been expecting from us rather too long .    3.194336466447422
i believe that the political message of this parliament should consist of something more original than a mere UNK of the neo - UNK economic mantra .    3.91921034755897
something more robust than a call to surrender to the UNK of the market economy , something more decent than opposing UNK aims but denying them the means of their realisation .    3.7466121071978913
the report which has come to you from the economic committee UNK in all these respects .    3.662900060970447
unless it is restored in its original form by parliament , accepting the amendments retabled by the socialist group , i must take the unusual but inevitable course of asking my socialist colleagues and indeed anybody who believes that parliament should speak a meaningful language to vote against the report that bears my name but that is no longer mine either in thinking or in conscience .    3.6249138446237277
mr president , mr katiforis ' passion and conviction have prevented him from carrying out the usual task of a rapporteur in plenary which is to defend his report .    3.136849787518906
instead he has defended his own position which was not the one approved in committee .    3.5896369592616573
we clearly have different views , one of which is that we believe the development of the european economy can be regarded with confidence .    4.38172371673969
yesterday , when speaking to the committee on economic and monetary affairs , commissioner solbes specifically indicated that the prospects for this year and next for the european economy are excellent .    3.7385476232936896
moreover , several countries were mentioned whose problem is what to do with the public surplus .    3.482459096806052
they are having to choose , for example , between reducing taxes or reducing the public deficit , but clearly avoiding any price rises , or - so there is no misunderstanding - creating a special reserve for future situations in which welfare may be needed , given the eu ' s population growth .    3.611627598888325
we are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the union , now and in the coming years . it must be taken into account that we have an open , globalised and very competitive economy .    4.480621117925216
in order to reach and even UNK the leading position of the united states of america , we must avoid interventionism , as proposed initially by mr katiforis , and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures .    4.353593322357319
furthermore , the member states refused to contribute more funds when we discussed agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at union level .    3.6310226675016795
however , we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the european internal market which still has some serious flaws .    3.98271332376681
there are still sectors such as air transport , energy and telecommunications in which , if we compare our unit cost with that of the usa or other countries which are equally competitive at international level , the cost supported by our companies is very high .    3.8579055675042175
we therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention .    3.166145086541211
it is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the european union .    3.490388338906866
mr president , the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in mr katiforis , in my view , only served to call on the european parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people , social UNK and those living a precarious existence in our european union .    3.618674122819806
this is the objective , in respect of which he called upon the european parliament : give hope to the people of europe .    4.161842033054722
there is indeed economic recovery , but it only marginally reduces unemployment in europe .    3.5504611833738777
the votes of the ppe - de and the liberals have very considerably diminished , and even reversed , the meaning of his message .    3.461229408988591
that is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them , despite our efforts , and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment .    3.8516892119531985
what are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report ?    3.620173748573334
first of all , the affirmation that there is room for a europe of growth , but a europe of sustainable growth , that particularly respects the commitments of the european union at the conferences in kyoto and UNK UNK .    4.1794115465340065
there is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year UNK , by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions .    3.523082285197201
secondly , even the growth rate of 3 or 4 % , something we consider eminently feasible , will not be sufficient to reduce unemployment if we do not improve the job content of this growth .    3.7421015843471843
and we should say so very clearly , it will involve more savings on services , more third systems , more reductions in average working hours , whatever methods we adopt to achieve these things .    3.591530632005819
thirdly , we fully agree that it is necessary to reform labour relations in europe , but that clearly means for us that we must protect and enrich the human capital .    4.141872323040288
the lesson learned from the european experience is that where wages are lowest , where the salary ratio is the most flexible , unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest , where the social relations are the best regulated , the unemployment rate is the lowest .    3.7458316614104077
mr president , i think that this policy will engender not hope , but deep disappointment in european workers .    2.9719479356397063
the vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the european commission , ecofin and the central bank , but also the european parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo - liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the member states of the european union .    3.841578486210182
our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the european union and to send the commission and the council the sort of message which the european parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the european union .    4.270957736296739
even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high - level experts , who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas , failed miserably to UNK any support .    3.767652066014328
with this vote , the european parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it , by supporting an extreme neo - liberal economic and social policy ; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything , categorically opposes any form of public sector , UNK workers ' employment , wage , social and insurance rights , imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti - social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and UNK if they want to find a job .    3.6058005565327966
our group categorically condemns this perception and , in this sense , does not intend to support this resolution .    4.231842161798432
it will be voting against it .    3.396694122092485
mr president , the report presented by the commission on the union economy in 1999 appears to us to be UNK utter UNK as it scarcely shows why our performance remains UNK below the potential that the immense human resources of europe should allow .    3.3138209506432394
indeed , it is good to note that the forecast of 3 % growth for the year 2000 , which could have seemed rather bold when the commission announced it in november 1999 , now has a serious chance of being achieved , even in the context of continued inflation , since the peak of 2 % for the euro zone in january , nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past .    3.772259858670636
but we have the impression that this growth , sustained firstly by the performance of the united states , and then by the productivity gains of the new economy , by the new information and communication technologies , is driven by the general world situation , even despite our handicaps .    3.999977209212645
we are well aware of these handicaps , which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility , the excessive mandatory UNK .    3.195327408723268
but let us not forget that there is another one , a new handicap , with the single currency .    4.1109800953118505
in fact , the unification of monetary policies and the gradual UNK of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances .    3.2046984996460472
this unification is considered to be positive by the commission ' s report .    3.8691969878613994
but , in reality , we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation .    4.366504105451165
if you add the UNK of a single currency that is not built upon a state , itself based upon a people , you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in brussels , the markets ' suspicion of the euro .    3.887657184319318
indeed , it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999 , as it favoured growth in an unexpected way , but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is , in fact , symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions .    4.0333136836934775
mr president , the present draft resolution is controversial . given the topic it covers , this is hardly surprising .    3.2897358005329793
it is , after all , a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things , especially where the future is concerned .    3.190967509606911
even if he advocates sustainable growth , sustainability does not come into it .    3.1855039204048605
given the environmental and demographic developments , if anything , we ought to encourage member states to pursue a selective economic growth policy .    3.580775187081633
more investments , production and consumption only generate short - lived prosperity .    2.905366669888613
the use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced    3.392147811805159
other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes .    3.04138174779874
if member states do not do anything about this , there will be even fewer means for care , education and other important public UNK in the future .    4.171757076071878
an appeal in favour of a more pro - active government policy comes across as very odd .    3.5501940994155974
it does not take into account the latest eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which , at 2 % , is now at its maximum permitted level .    3.335810326013879
if , despite this , there is a desire to increase public spending , then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the european central bank raises interest rates again .    3.607499944895932
what the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium - sized enterprises , in particular .    3.5159730776424474
high unemployment in the european union concerns all of us , especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting .    4.131115872893623
promoting employment , however , is a long - winded affair and comes under structural policy .    4.384567930257872
member states , in particular , should adopt an effective policy .    4.079070582933144
in order to achieve this , they must be given the necessary leeway .    3.6134979692535008
UNK by imposing social convergence criteria and other community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs .    3.6454028937892953
however , shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and UNK is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution .    3.86651314681242
mr president , first of all , i would like to congratulate my colleague giorgos katiforis on the report he presented to us . not the report he presented to us here today , but the one he presented to the committee on economic and monetary affairs , because politically speaking , these are two completely different reports .    3.2758142013087213
in very general terms , we could call the first report a left - wing one , as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones . the report we have before us now and which mr katiforis is reluctant to defend - and i think that he is right in this - is a UNK report , from which the main conclusions have been removed , and is based on social concerns .    4.810563763148656
what did mr katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report ?    4.8107595307124305
he proposed an ambitious report , based on an optimistic europe , which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve .    3.7434529798973326
and europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets .    3.878386455131333
why , for example , was the proposal to increase europe ' s active population to 75 % of the total population removed , when we currently have levels of around 60 % ?    4.267756603802256
we therefore need to UNK our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive .    3.1748057166913317
as has been advocated for the lisbon summit , we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training .    3.8796560840603265
we also need investment to grow at a faster rate .    3.009433892492749
we are all familiar with the idea advocated by mr von wogau , according to which what we need is a flexible workforce .    3.206281671801747
i would like to counter this with the example of portugal , where employment laws are not flexible , and where unemployment stands at less than 5 % - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing , with community support of course , at a rate considerably higher than the community average .    3.674840258766763
what we want , therefore , is for europe to enjoy economic growth , but also be prepared to address social issues .    5.021452183485811
mr president , like many others , i want to thank mr katiforis for an interesting report .    3.2039284900767533
when i read the report and see the picture of the eu ' s economy that is described there , i think it is quite a worrying picture .    4.2936131484048765
investment levels are too low , unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth .    3.9405758941573703
it is not , therefore , perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies , in spite of rumours to the effect that the european central bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it .    3.699221851001311
the rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself , which is something i agree with .    3.6988968123081953
there is far too much talk about stability , convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development .    3.3789542704422253
as far as i am concerned , emu cooperation UNK UNK large as a UNK which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present UNK economy .    3.187185475252794
my conclusions about this differ completely , however , from those of the previous speaker .    4.650655067339342
i believe we have to place our confidence in human resources , partly through a macro - economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training , democratisation and good social conditions .    3.0620042399198364
in this context , i can , in fact , see the emu project ' s main weakness , for it is true that you cannot act like UNK and raise the european economies from above .    3.8635100479719418
instead , you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the member states .    4.029280978917975
mr president , commissioner , i have the feeling that some of the previous speakers have not read the 1999 annual report on the union economy in its entirety and have made a conscious decision not to listen to my group ' s spokesman , karl von wogau , for the document that we are debating today , and which has had a report written on it , points to the fact that the introduction of the euro has been a success .    4.254301970894566
it points to the problems experienced in 1999 , when , notwithstanding the problems , there was currency and price stability , increased employment , the UNK of a period of upturn , and it was possible to make a start on reducing unemployment .    4.6129708591128855
in terms of outlook , the document points to an UNK , to long - term prospects and the measures required to achieve this , which karl von wogau then UNK to enlarge upon .    4.008055842475996
i am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one , for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy .    4.469381751997823
we want to continue along the successful european path to growth and employment and a functioning internal market , to hasten our progress and supplement this with the necessary measures .    3.531310833989402
the left - wing of this house does not want to continue along this path , rather it makes dramatic statements such as : what we need is state intervention , not the extension and consolidation of the market economy .    3.860345187478918
state intervention has always led to a high level of debt , and a higher level of debt has always damaged growth and employment , as well as social justice .    4.159549912169352
that is what the debate we are having is all about , on the subject of which i have this to say to you : we need more freedom and less state intervention .    4.534052456217674
it is sound framework conditions and not state intervention that enables enterprises to create growth and employment .    2.8538974526187344
mr president , the economic situation of the european union from the viewpoint of the workers is eighteen million unemployed people , it is the UNK of insecurity , of low wages , of deteriorating working conditions .    4.06305401706506
the commission has the cynicism to consider wage restraint as a positive factor , whereas in france alone , over three million workers receive a salary that is close to the poverty line and they barely survive any better than the other three million people kept unemployed by an UNK economy .    3.0636366845174865
but you never speak of restraining the income of shareholders that is infinitely higher from the outset and which increases UNK every year .    2.878832005912607
what you have as a result are all these major trusts that cut jobs while their profits are high , and which often make staff redundant simply to make their share price rise on the stock market .    3.6523365718790957
eleven thousand job losses at UNK and UNK - UNK , twenty two thousand at UNK , ten thousand at abb / alsthom power , not to mention all the others .    3.8150761595164235
the economic growth on which you pride yourself only benefits a fortunate minority , the owners and shareholders of the large industrial and banking groups .    3.1010305577593407
but beware of the UNK from the workers and the unemployed , who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but , on the contrary , are getting worse .    3.872694876506135
this is the key ideological struggle for europe facing us .    3.028335827352305
this debate , i think , has UNK it up .    4.28676188179242
the key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening , and it is no surprise that this issue has UNK the debate in a house which is known for its consensus and its carve - out politics , and i am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear , because this report is a radical one .    4.216534655258086
this report is a wake - up call to europe .    2.615058633132986
this report recommends radical measures , which in essence will make it easier to employ people .    3.9508692165804007
it is as simple as that .    3.1145492304738265
the reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets .    4.2868504216414784
this is the only way to go forward , because the real way to deliver social justice in europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs .    3.9244608779346084
this report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that , because europe has to wake up .    3.860954436468056
it cannot create jobs just by government spending .    2.7688626675585235
it cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours , as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people .    2.8675572728905667
the real world simply does not work like that .    3.508197937796307
but if you want europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of europe , then i would call upon you all to give your support to this report , because it will deliver those jobs , and it will deliver those opportunities , and it is the only way to do so .    4.438655009979063
mr president , the original version of the giorgos katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations , based on the precise observations of the commission report on the economic situation in europe , for a european union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent .    3.8468560006360795
these recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the union ' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy , which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment .    4.234863779835993
it is this absence of management of the european economy which is responsible , my dear mr von wogau , for the fall of the euro .    3.9893957947217302
the report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a european research area and the promotion in all countries of the union of converging measures on research , lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the states in the field of taxation .    3.607002863796819
lastly , the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in president delors ' white paper on the promotion of a european project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services .    3.7534384869450794
these recommendations , which , for the most part , are consistent with the guidelines in the portuguese presidency ' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the lisbon summit , have been rejected or distorted by the committee on economic and monetary affairs of this parliament , by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a european union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets .    4.147986424171519
mr president , this parliament , which has shown itself to be highly europeanist so many times , must , on this occasion , show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures .    4.0487395068464505
mr president , mr katiforis ' s report is exciting .    2.5875984481769905
in its original form , it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy .    3.151232668930737
it is therefore sad that , in committee , the group of the european people ' s party and european democrats and the group of the european liberal , democrat and reform party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously .    3.3131438661119357
the debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this .    3.192566095344865
it is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals , namely that the union ' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments , partly in order to involve all the union ' s citizens in the information society , something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view .    4.191837023101652
i am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant states ' links with trans - european networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and it infrastructure .    3.005600683648293
this is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people , both within the eu and between the eu and the applicant states .    4.292260323344265
the applicant states ought not merely to tag along behind but , instead , share the eu ' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field .    3.3952966863417786
society needs , therefore , to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern it infrastructure which also reaches small companies , poor regions and ordinary citizens .    3.639654946799548
we have that opportunity right now . let us grasp it .    3.342923290468296
mr president , the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before .    3.7342955968750506
i would like to say that i strongly disagree with mrs villiers ' view that this is such an interesting debate .    3.1278698748838174
i think that the european parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and UNK out old political concepts and visions .    3.2712657741921203
it would have been much better if we had actually made the effort to reach compromises and to develop a common vision .    3.6138292114010144
i think that , in this way , the european parliament is excluding itself from the discussion at the very moment that an extremely interesting development is taking place in the european union where a very wide , socio - economic agenda is being drawn up much more clearly .    4.03418357646162
the portuguese presidency has submitted a wide agenda of this kind for the extra summit in lisbon .    3.60565998727817
the commission has done this in its five - year plan by listing one of the four priorities .    3.564727178566603
the commission document too , which is being drafted for the summit in lisbon , takes precisely such a wide approach which covers different areas .    3.7084314214603076
i think that in adopting this wide socio - economic approach , the european union is taking exactly the right line , not least because that is the economic entity on the basis of which policy is drafted .    3.8971588909775234
in this light , i think that the european parliament ' s role will be limited in lisbon , but also in the forum in june for which we might have an invitation , but are UNK as to the input we can have .    4.419948430306534
are we going to have nothing more to report than the fact that we are still UNK in a mould of old political contradictions ?    4.148012906428936
. ( es ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i must thank this house for its serious and detailed work .    2.581373298294967
there is no doubt that the hearings of experts and the debates in committee have provided us with additional high - quality information .    3.0704593775080635
there is also no doubt that , throughout the debate this afternoon , we have heard differing opinions about the possible policies .    4.477062259339605
however , i believe that there are also some elements of consensus .    3.420047627583592
we all agree that the current economic UNK is good .    3.207807471063328
i will briefly comment on these issues before concentrating on the last point which i regard as the essential issue in today ' s debate .    3.4477280495940126
yesterday , as some of you have noted , the committee on economic and monetary affairs referred to the improvement in the economic situation in europe .    3.563783481981057
we currently believe that this improvement , which we highlighted in the perspectives in november , may lead to even better results than initially forecast .    4.008440153892582
employment is growing at a good rate .    3.4890794656856627
despite yesterday ' s figures , we certainly consider that the fact that inflation was around 2 % in december shows that this is an issue which must be pursued . however , the rate of underlying inflation demonstrates that the UNK tendencies are due to certain very specific elements such as the rise in oil prices and exchange rate developments .    4.43160916215604
when we submitted our report , we referred to the risks posed by growth .    3.432974151956722
we basically highlighted the possibility of UNK difficulties in terms of growth in the usa , and therefore in other parts of the world , and of a sudden rise in inflation .    4.303104461793521
parliament ' s analysis has highlighted another issue which is the development of risk in the stock markets .    4.165517793977241
the commission regards this as significant although we do not believe that this is the basic problem .    3.957615195541116
anyway , we currently have some excellent opportunities to do more .    3.6989545861941138
we all agree that , after a decade of very weak growth and intolerable unemployment , certain action must be taken .    3.004027586072324
we need public and private investment .    3.184690877558471
our levels of research and development are too low compared with our competitors and our low level of employment reflects , among other factors , the imbalances in our labour market .    3.1695015359855794
our aim must therefore be to make this UNK of the economy long - lasting with strong growth and job creation .    3.8948138378268817
the latter element continues to be the commission ' s fundamental objective , as we indicated in the prodi document submitted for your debate at the lisbon summit , in that we are aiming for full employment in the medium term .    4.613536313152523
what policy should we use to achieve these objectives ?    3.8639774980075727
in our opinion , the union ' s economy is UNK but we still have UNK production capacity , not only in terms of physical capital but also new sources of jobs .    3.9688726000739387
the policy mix to be applied should specifically allow this capacity to be fully UNK .    3.761163938227847
we must define a macro - economic policy which aids growth .    2.8272865226597497
this is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growth for growth ' s sake .    3.473001130919834
it is simply a budgetary policy which can be coherent with price stability but which also allows us to have an appropriate monetary policy which contributes to growth .    3.5110725720753697
this policy mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and will lead to growth .    3.6003539087084695
the eu ' s potential for growth must pay particular attention to certain factors , on most of which i believe we agree with parliament ' s analysis .    4.31270052840729
firstly , private investment must be assisted .    3.1697180094550013
the union must help to promote the spirit of enterprise and to generate employment in this way , but without forgetting public investment .    3.711733851526344
this has been the major victim in recent years and any improvements in public finances must lead to improvements in public investment . however , this must be carried out with respect for our tax consolidation commitments .    4.109339810070109
our main support in the future must be for research and development and human capital .    4.385985074913506
these are two of the principal challenges for the lisbon summit .    2.8972768602841255
it is essential that we tackle these challenges with quantified objectives and specific definitions . this will ultimately allow us to achieve our goal of clear improvements in productivity , thus enabling our society to grow , together with a rise in employment which will go some way towards making up the ground lost in recent years .    3.224193977770444
this is the policy which the commission has defended and will continue to defend in lisbon .    4.222998718458088
common fisheries policy    5.886986892025427
the next item is the joint debate on the following reports :    1.9129003561689215
a5 - UNK / 2000 by mrs attwooll , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council regulation establishing a community framework for the collection and management of the fisheries data needed to conduct the common fisheries policy ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) ;    2.46056767020653
a5 - UNK / 2000 by mrs attwooll , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council decision on a financial contribution from the community towards the expenditure incurred by the member states in collecting data , and for financing studies and pilot projects for carrying out the common fisheries policy ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) .    2.5774192381543966
the proposals for a council regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and for a council decision on a financial contribution in this respect are both very welcome .    3.449550044091265
so is a joint debate on them since each can only be fully understood in the light of the other .    4.120208414769162
i understand that they have been some five years in their gestation .    3.8499242250317343
with the review of the common fisheries policy due in 2002 , it is important that swift progress is now made .    3.8531973652079143
to take first the proposal for the council regulation , this makes provision for member states to collect a wider range of data relating to fisheries than required under previous regulations .    3.4807623518918906
both biological and economic information are included .    3.200384161280204
the proposal also makes provision for member states to produce such data in aggregated form .    3.183993493764695
exactly which new data are to be collected and what is to be aggregated from these and existing data will be specified by an implementing regulation .    3.957369257349535
the implementing regulation will establish a minimum community programme and an extended community programme .    3.363035899401848
it appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective , for example , by type of fish stock .    3.409147199946923
the proposal for the council decision allows for the making of the financial contribution by the community to member states engaged in the collection and management of data .    3.876473269182048
it also allows the commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects .    3.0963782086016662
the only apparent sanction for member states that do not completely fulfil the requirements of the minimum programme under the regulation is that they will not be eligible for any financial assistance in respect to the extended programme .    4.050195550757094
two major areas of concern about the proposal were considered by the committee .    3.9467354056004025
the first relates to the degree of involvement of the commission .    3.4192073290548426
the original proposal simply allowed for the information being gathered to be transmitted to international organisations .    3.391089840816733
the commission would only receive a copy of any such UNK if it requested one .    3.195216590345693
since , however , the community is funding the exercise , it was felt appropriate for it to see a direct return on its investment .    5.140815917441251
thus , amendment no 6 , while maintaining the freedom of member states to transmit the data to international organisations , requires that it also be sent annually to the commission .    3.9077102269503565
this change is taken in conjunction with amendments nos 1 , 4 and 7 .    3.5958433446552007
amendment no 1 clarifies the point that , although the data are to be scientifically based , they are being collected for wider decision - making purposes .    4.350552254789822
amendment no 4 makes it clear that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fisheries resources generally .    3.4934451850163817
amendment no 7 calls on the commission to report annually on the use it has made of the data collected under the regulation .    3.942240200158393
it is also designed to give greater momentum to the process with earlier and more frequent reporting back by the commission on the progress of the data collection programme as a whole .    3.430635529584741
the other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation .    2.835060583265442
first , in respect to economic data , amendment no 2 makes two changes .    3.5825495008063633
one attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued .    3.698809759387854
the other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue , subsidies , interest received , etc . , with a reference simply to volume of sales .    3.232621311902176
it is considered that without these changes UNK high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in member states and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality .    3.769147083755361
in conjunction with these changes , amendment no 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly .    3.7874638043109177
secondly , in respect to the environmental data , the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information .    3.523851243737264
the commission has , however , made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind .    3.6850123039652796
it has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by member states at a later stage .    3.5632469214498337
amendment no 3 brings into the UNK of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems .    3.8875275880358546
this will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary .    3.442828788876505
it should be stressed that the amendment does not in any way require the commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes .    3.6723108378471547
it merely permits the commission to do so should it so wish .    4.10139087198271
as already stated the proposal for the council decision falls into two parts .    3.809315587628289
the first is concerned with financing the member states in implementing the community programmes .    3.296337514981106
the second is to allow the commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects .    3.3079263901809512
amendments nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority .    3.018826149406302
more significantly , under amendment no 1 , the fisheries committee accepts the recommendation of the budgets committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1 ( b ) rather than heading 3 of the financial perspective .    3.5091448654224595
although in its preliminary draft budget the commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 ' internal policies ' , parliament created a new budget line b1 - 500 to finance the measures under discussion .    2.9491104430702624
this provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available .    4.708864067605682
) mr president , i believe we totally agree with mrs attwooll ' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two commission proposals , intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio - economic situation of the fisheries sector , come at a critical time .    3.8781601068805673
the proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner .    3.669106313066639
this will only be true , of course , if the data can actually be obtained because , as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur , the commission ' s proposal does not establish any element of UNK on the member states .    4.516713580387724
the sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance , which is not very significant anyway , will not be received .    4.040095353560293
in view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector , as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the magps , i believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector , we will end up with total confusion . for example , some member states will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources , according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data .    3.9885418282913374
i am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management . this has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory , as with the magps .    3.208871861597209
in view of this problem , which seems to me to be the most serious , the fisheries committee report improves the proposal in certain important points , particularly with the rapporteur ' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the commission .    3.900663917577726
my group has included two reasonable requests .    2.8515367035477457
as a result , this report is very satisfactory and , on behalf of my group , i therefore ask for its approval .    3.7118464331076195
i wish at the outset to congratulate mrs attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report .    3.352803631133461
i welcome the establishment of a community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which i believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish .    3.7000263059231133
it is important , of course , that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various member states must be standardised across the community and , as stated by the rapporteur in her report , must be in compliance with international provisions .    4.525982342783793
i welcome the availability of funding for national programmes , even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met .    3.50723500986264
i agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the commission .    3.9190429039729686
otherwise the purpose of collecting and UNK data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue .    3.275987695929148
sound , UNK information is in the best interests of the industry .    4.502427399442745
i believe that the streamlined information to be made available will be of major benefit and importance to the decision makers and to their advisers and will go some way to ensure a more sustainable fishery that will continue to provide jobs in parts of the union where there is no alternative source of employment .    4.4188556280386155
i am pleased to confirm that in my country they are working to ensure that the detailed practicalities , the logistics and utilisation of information are developed in the best interests of the resource of the industry and decision makers and our group has no difficulty in supporting these reports .    3.673937909364206
mr president , behind the report , which is an honest one , by mrs attwooll , which we shall vote for , we see the european fisheries policy . it is not easy to manage because clearly in an open sea , which is immense and without borders , it is not easy to manage fish on the move .    4.295185834962234
we are trying to manage a policy of catches and in so doing we are creating UNK .    3.7233875855208978
it is indeed a good idea to wish to prevent the depletion of fragile resources , but what is the point if europe restricts its catches and world catches increase ?    3.353300939655618
what is the point of banning european drift nets in the UNK d ' UNK or elsewhere , if japan , korea and UNK use them and land fish here which we are not allowed to catch ?    3.3915012956390025
what is the point of destroying the french fishing fleet , at UNK or elsewhere , for example , if every year france has to spend two billion euros on importing fish caught and landed , while our fishermen are not allowed to catch it .    2.9739080092615415
what is more , the movement of fish is like co2 or like capital , it is not european , but world - wide .    3.411736686863695
brussels , which wanted to do away with nations on the pretext that they were unsuited to the task , now in turn finds itself unsuited to managing a resource which itself is an international asset .    3.377730406392391
together with mrs attwooll , i am in favour of collecting scientific data , and of fair and accurate checks , on condition that they do not vary according to the severity or the UNK of the administrations . i am in favour of enlightened management by marine scientists , like professor UNK , or others , that will make it possible to discover that the basic problems are not so much to do with industrial fishing - although it plays a serious and negative part - but more to do with UNK , the large underwater hot mass or cold mass rivers , which have a much greater effect than human influence .    4.26517601881421
but to enlighten the decision makers , let us practise honest science , without the UNK motive of having the european union finance excuses to destroy our fishing boats .    3.7711251470763427
for if we must preserve the UNK of fish , we must also preserve the ports and the fishermen .    4.35311983550314
instead of always following behind the united states , in seattle , in kosovo , in iraq , perhaps the europe of brussels could suggest , over and above the international fishing organisations that exist in the north atlantic , in the pacific , over and above the regulation of tuna , cod or other things , that europe should take the initiative and organise an international conference on fishing , a kind of UNK bay of the fisheries resources which would be held between UNK , japanese , UNK , russians , europeans , and we could manage the fisheries resources scientifically as an asset common to humanity .    3.9358943968144833
that would be good internationalism as opposed to the bad internationalism , as practised with the free exchange areas and other false friends of the oecd .    3.103617874254561
the northern ireland fishing industry has received many hard UNK from this union .    3.283834530443003
they have seen their own waters UNK by others while they have had to put up their own boats and UNK from fishing .    3.538968450830588
the recent decisions on the cod quota for the irish sea is yet another hard blow which could well prove to be a mortal blow to the northern ireland fishing industry .    3.1066369438553836
i see the commissioner UNK but i speak with the authority of all the political parties in northern ireland , a diverse UNK but all agreed on this one issue .    3.88343277963433
the european union needs to recognise that when such drastic decisions are taken against conflicting scientific evidence submitted by the fishermen themselves , which have been totally rejected out of hand , for the conservation of their own fish stocks , then serious trouble can only result when these men are not heard .    3.685762715886873
at a recent visit in brussels these fishermen ' s representatives , duly accredited , travelled from northern ireland and they were threatened with expulsion from the meeting when they sought to argue a case that they had very well prepared .    3.0298871520462933
that is scandalous , their case ought to be heard .    3.6720816638941125
it should be put on record , and i want to put it on record today .    4.701915737333557
i UNK in the meeting where the scientists told us that haddock would soon be extinct in the irish sea and at that very time haddock had a special , spectacular increase of breeding in the irish sea so the scientists can be wrong .    3.335637153980228
as i have said all the northern ireland parties are united on this issue and those responsible for this cod quota regulation should reconsider this decision which can only spell not conservation for the fish but UNK to northern ireland fisheries which will affect all the fisheries of this union .    3.2634177084095684
mr president , mrs attwooll ' s reports are extremely important as indeed is the prospect of having as much data as possible on the fisheries sectors of the member states . this is particularly true given that the commission must soon prepare a report on the revision of the common fisheries policy in the year 2002 .    4.332052014940325
however , the fact that the updating and sending of data are purely optional and that this involves a very wide range of data and sectors may distort the final objective of the commission ' s proposal .    3.585177450212969
this has happened , as previously mentioned , with the magps . these have seriously prejudiced the countries which have strictly complied with them and provided the corresponding data to the commission , compared with other countries which have failed to comply or simply not provided the data .    4.060771961825064
it should be pointed out that not all the member states have the same amount of data .    4.033150710931898
some have different sectors and , in view of the volume of data to be sent , could be prejudiced compared with those which have a smaller volume of data , if the same deadlines are set .    4.191849482812756
these deadlines for submission must therefore be UNK accordingly .    3.574628293440885
much of this data is confidential , as has also been mentioned , which could affect the competitiveness of the sectors involved and their enterprises .    3.998684251616744
we must therefore act very carefully in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data .    3.1376341339302205
some of the data is also irrelevant such as that referring to the taxation of enterprises .    3.8367053789192087
finally , mr president , as i must be brief given the time constraints , i must congratulate our rapporteur , mrs attwooll , on the important work which she has carried out within our committee .    4.081072821287775
i too want to congratulate mrs attwooll and say that i agree with most of what she said .    3.958135673581414
i regard it as a weakness in the proposal that reporting is not mandatory in all member states .    3.2923640891147556
i cannot understand the proposal to make a regulation out of which it is possible for some member states to slip without any penalty and i cannot understand either that within a european union where we are only 50 % self - sufficient in fish for our domestic needs that there is any highly sensitive information , that by making the reports that are necessary that the national interest or the regional interest of some states or fishing communities is going to be put at risk .    4.057004079411968
in view of the coming review of the policy in 2002 it is important that we have all possible information , economic as well as biological .    4.943845721634642
in the past somebody said to me i have been defending the decisions the commission makes .    3.6141283988654207
it is not very easy in coastal areas anywhere in the union to defend the european union in the whole area of fisheries , but i have been defending them on the grounds that decisions are made on properly based scientific knowledge .    4.42026812058558
i am informed when i take a closer look that the information is in fact quite UNK - UNK with UNK coming from here and there and no clear , proper economic and biological picture emerging .    3.7869426337166696
if we do not have this picture then it will not be possible to make reasonable decisions in two years ' time about the future of the policy .    3.836800450362977
it is not easy , indeed i could speak for everybody in my constituency that live in the coastal areas too and say that they are agreed on one thing , that the european union is the source of all their problems and all their difficulties .    3.807438791021539
well , i do not agree with them but i think if we do not base our information and our decisions on good scientific information , and if there is not an equal obligation on everyone to give it , then we will have bad decisions .    4.414647443440488
mr president , commissioner , no one could dispute the usefulness of implementing the qualitative and quantitative data on the fishing industry , particularly in view of the reform of the cfp in 2002 .    3.221901390693386
we are also of the opinion that community funds should be set aside to fund these activities .    3.2363623241274846
a common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements .    3.7664544280716754
to this end , more extensive , compatible , uniform data is required , and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the union ' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted .    3.6451732791922007
however , we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities , differences , varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries , and that they will not be disregarded , penalised or even eliminated due to the UNK of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies , as has sometimes occurred in the past .    4.118568006219357
a case in point is the mediterranean , including my country ' s fishing industry .    4.1320641893438195
after years of the cfp for the mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid , regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy , with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation .    3.26753453052217
this is a worthy objective , the implementation of which , however , has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of mediterranean species of fish .    3.4740772143003444
a subsequent regulation , regulation UNK , adopted , not by chance , in 1999 , permitted certain exemptions , in particular for special cases .    3.855298948249398
the time period will UNK on 31 may next , to be precise , when the commission will present a proposal .    4.429708437758284
we hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that , from the point of view of biological implications , resources are , to some extent , sustainable .    3.872087080460305
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.8713701510554521
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6351633559938676
combating certain fish diseases    4.568597284869084
the next item is the report a5 - 0036 / 2000 by mr hudghton , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council directive amending directive 93 / 53 / eec introducing minimum community measures for the control of certain fish diseases ( com ( 1999 ) - c5 - 0168 / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) .    2.6068199702503194
although the virus has been found in other species , the disease itself is so far confined to salmon .    2.9420290521874026
the scottish salmon - farming industry is the biggest in the eu , spread throughout some of europe ' s most peripheral communities .    3.3119191463385347
it sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around eur 800 million annually .    2.7308554111615844
it is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of europe that the disease be brought under control and , if possible , eradicated .    4.072015796383239
the current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be UNK whether affected by the disease or not .    3.3029314836870687
the intention in adopting the current regime was to eradicate isa and to do so as quickly as possible .    3.26445765809409
the reality is that the compulsory slaughter policy has failed even to contain , let alone eradicate isa , and while failing to deliver its objectives , the present rule has had a devastating economic effect on the industry with no compensation being paid and no possibility of commercial insurance .    3.344231482735907
the proposed changes are twofold : the first would permit the use of vaccination as a weapon in this battle .    3.4992435582866572
this is a necessary change and should be accompanied by a commitment at european level to instigate and fund research into developing an effective vaccine .    3.1096762228043238
the second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms , working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm .    3.4887366718900856
this approach has been used very effectively in norway where new reports of isa are down to a handful of cases a year having UNK at some 80 - 90 cases per year in the early 1990s .    3.2148407497754157
i therefore support the commission ' s proposed changes and i am calling for their urgent adoption and implementation .    3.863237298785749
i also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of council decision 90 / 424 / eec by specifically including isa in its UNK list of diseases , thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50 % commission , 50 % member state .    3.316298391248151
i thank colleagues in the fisheries committee for their overwhelming vote in support of my report and i in particular thank my scottish colleagues in the committee for their input to this whole process .    4.217934389052772
i am opposing amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the fisheries committee .    3.0550247762092617
most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text .    3.3993175896230943
in particular , i have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon , the need to investigate the source of isa and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks .    4.040052509010235
these amendments by the green component of the greens / european free alliance group are designed to provide justification for amendment 13 .    2.7801320260832125
this amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish , whether diseased or not , from an affected farm from being sold and i must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold .    3.6966020079499726
there is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold .    3.4332281257348773
amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the UNK UNK statistics from scotland and from norway .    3.8120403241489376
in scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective .    3.224900382355049
in norway , with their much longer experience , compulsory , 100 % culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation .    3.361945800549241
it is in all of our interests to ensure that in scotland too we contain isa and prevent its further spread .    3.746859364293058
last week saw the publication in scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on isa .    3.5304948164045395
this comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site - to - site transmission , security measures to UNK escapes , treatment of waste and UNK , methods of detection and diagnosis , UNK and rotation , UNK of equipment and many , many more .    3.6097216245043757
all will be beneficial , not just in relation to isa but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required .    3.6264425631150483
your votes , colleagues , in favour of my report in full , as endorsed by the fisheries committee , will be a very important part of a wider isa control package based on the reality of scotland ' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others .    4.361365686512204
i congratulate mr hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable members of parliament to do likewise .    3.906700296529321
as he said , fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural scotland and at a time when the rural areas of scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years , the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend .    3.2438723746607683
now , as he said , in excess of 85 000 tons of salmon is now produced in scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than eur 800 million annually .    2.960279453702144
regrettably , although isa was first detected in scotland only two years ago , it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around UNK other farms are affected in some way or another .    3.378517231234773
wild salmon , UNK and UNK have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment .    4.215362793773398
but i must say that despite the scare - UNK of the greens , it has to be emphasised that isa cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans , and i must repeat what mr hudghton said , that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold - water species .    4.067952738816794
it can , nevertheless , in the affected fish , lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around eur 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures .    3.395601623651625
so this report , mr president , provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the uk and elsewhere should respond to the disease .    4.701714668787673
by recommending the introduction of a method of UNK and gradual culling , similar to the system used successfully in norway , the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence , not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto UNK clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter .    3.8713146797734677
by recommending the research , development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate isa , the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine .    3.123290992878474
so i thoroughly recommend and hope that the parliament will support this excellent report .    3.694486988530498
i would like to thank the rapporteur , mr hudghton , also for this report .    2.7193373431582284
scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the european union and UNK 90 % of the british UNK industry .    4.344545585417403
the industry is located in some of europe ' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities .    3.451933083121951
in recent research it is estimated that the industry is worth eur 800 million per annum and 6 500 jobs rely on its existence .    2.9001962494286886
i believe that this report gives a clear method for dealing with infectious salmon anaemia which is both practical , realistic and also achievable .    2.9634646716545014
the example of norway demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach .    3.7430566719110536
as for the amendments , i oppose the amendments tabled by mr hudghton ' s green colleagues , that is numbers 7 to 13 , not because i do not care about the risks to human health but because , according to scientific evidence , the virus does not survive beyond 25o celsius and according to medical evidence , human beings at that temperature are dead .    3.7102882418109155
there is a saying that the dead tell no tales and i am sure they do not eat fish but i do and i look forward to the implementation of this report .    4.101997489656427
i too would like to compliment mr hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development .    3.5487958554056576
i too agree that amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate , indeed amendment 13 would not merely UNK the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules .    3.2774331590820562
this is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming .    3.9170250395491104
secondly , looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the katiforis report later this evening , paragraph 28 is of particular importance .    3.091052721052785
this calls on the commission and member states to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment .    4.019968454740814
thirdly , referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data , i very much hope that the commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but i believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment , not the way that is suggested in amendments 7 to 13 , and i hope honourable members will reject them .    4.463033916291418
mr president , i do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues , who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers ' health .    3.316708760301067
this infectious salmon disease is caused by an UNK which breaks down the blood of salmon , causing death .    3.173709224946344
it UNK very easily through UNK in UNK water , etc . under the 1993 directive , not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected , exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution .    3.620562280095493
what we currently propose is to UNK this directive , so that we do not UNK all the fish , but only the fish that are found to be diseased .    4.552055380289963
for the others , well , we would have time to see what would happen , according to local circumstances .    4.775613422294899
i think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way .    3.3271785267472076
i would particularly draw my colleagues ' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of UNK has every advantage for the human race and that , consequently , there is no risk to men .    3.7305193807980492
what about women ?    3.4335774205913254
nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard .    3.288610083757473
there is also a risk to the environment , because we know that there is an UNK period in salmon and that , consequently , if they are UNK , they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk .    4.505019371430072
there is another risk to the environment as well , because this disease is transmitted to wild fish , as we have seen .    3.6426306165909748
for this reason , together with my colleague , UNK mckenna , we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the commission .    3.3684871008857797
mr UNK explained why we support some aspects of the commission ' s proposal , in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish , but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy .    3.9968743115531384
now people have said here that norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of isa and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the norwegian approach , but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the norwegian policy and that of the community .    4.508254013671564
this is a community policy which will effect ireland as well - where i am from - should similar unfortunate events occur .    3.115275602297467
there are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease , UNK periods , restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others . before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the UNK , we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster .    3.517571012636096
and people have spoken in the past about bse .    4.215772007074299
for many years the greens were calling for the bse issue to be addressed .    3.4604980075165783
had it been at that time , you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the eu a huge amount of money .    3.6096478191071486
so it also has to do with environmental protection .    3.941801976978926
the protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health .    3.3746340806756785
i would like to thank mr hudghton for his excellent report on isa and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening .    3.397578041634841
the commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms .    3.205093884296701
however , this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating isa .    3.320972368485712
nor can it be done , if the proposal involves a threat to public health .    4.106903784630241
the environmental implications must also be taken very seriously .    3.6094680668754386
i am advised that isa is considered non - UNK for humans and mammals .    3.0706036994994754
the disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals .    3.307352561486385
the virus UNK cold - blooded animals .    3.145543095375274
it does not replicate at temperatures above UNK centigrade and would , if present in fish for human consumption , be UNK when ingested .    3.170408962341226
in no way , however , can diseased fish be used for human consumption .    4.066220141804246
as an extra precaution , i am UNK this advice to our scientific committee .    3.778015377212386
during the debate , a number of important issues linked to our disease - control strategy have been raised including compensation .    3.4016063459257673
i deeply regret the losses suffered by the scottish salmon industry .    2.8471499036962085
you may know that with effect from 15 january 2000 , under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance , member states may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture .    3.5879249509951654
the commission ' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument .    3.796008422841766
i must emphasise , however , that there are serious constraints .    4.096781169702018
budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set .    4.358752494237607
so further thought is necessary .    3.325387541738273
i regret therefore that i am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through decision 90 / 424 .    3.4657991640325925
this is in particular the case for amendments nos 3 and 5 .    3.690654824754692
i am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance .    3.1348126622128545
the commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon .    3.0835149661338943
the intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations .    3.880623932333129
experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers .    3.2927118858482527
those could perpetuate an infection .    3.0790140413595997
i therefore am not able to accept amendment no 4 .    3.35665395164159
you also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease .    4.15117250848365
i agree that such research is needed and i understand this is at present being organised in the united kingdom .    3.4258762643152565
i will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals .    3.368011449190258
it must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the community must be organised .    3.7922375782179296
in this context i am happy to partly accept amendment no 1 , taking into account , however , that scientific investigations are not done by the commission but that the commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the member states .    4.040508584615316
i also can partly accept the part of amendment no 6 saying that directive 93 / 53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence .    3.6488059940834794
as i pointed out earlier , the available scientific evidence is that isa is not a threat to health .    3.4993386496133185
i can therefore agree to amendment no 10 with the proviso that the words , and i quote , " of the highest possible standard " are replaced by " are safe " .    3.381597170096873
with regard to the environmental impact , it is a well - known phenomenon that while stocks have fallen during the last decades several reasons have been advanced to explain these reductions : pollution , over - fishing , changes in climate , etc . it cannot at present be excluded that isa has an impact on wild stock .    3.4294945087725757
fish escapes from aquaculture premises have been reported in the past and the virus has been found in wild stocks .    3.138609240877088
in this context , a number of scientific questions that can only be resolved through further research remain open .    3.341442298913549
it is for that reason that a careful approach towards the control of isa is needed .    3.60004356187858
diseased fish should not remain in the farms and i am prepared to look into the matter so as to avoid unnecessary shedding of a virus into the environment .    3.600915565656562
for that purpose , i propose to amend our initial proposal to provide that rural programmes established by the competent authority must be approved by the commission . this is to avoid excessive withdrawal periods .    4.163484939786225
i also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate .    2.997364448740751
the procedures for setting additional control measures that already exist in community legislation will be used to establish withdrawal schemes based on the state of health of the fish in order to minimise a possible environmental impact .    3.9149782946499356
bearing this in mind , i can agree to accept amendment nos 7 and 8 with a minor change to the latter .    3.4231982109451202
i am also very UNK towards amendment no 9 , but i believe that it can be better formulated so as to join , at the same time , environmental concerns and disease control and eradication strategies .    3.8825444732454546
i do not feel in a position to accept amendments nos 12 and 13 .    2.7688852068394088
it is my feeling that these amendments aim to achieve a zero risk .    3.448818431570075
i believe this objective is very difficult to achieve without closing down the fish farming sector concerned .    3.22237895711585
i look forward to parliament ' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward .    3.77158962446102
i can partly accept amendment no 11 .    3.289962598846993
finally , i would like to emphasise that we continue to strive to maintain a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations under the treaty .    3.5573224246018857
i believe that measures that are proportionate to that objective is the way forward .    3.199049364956797
we remain committed to eradicating the disease , an objective that will be beneficial for both the environment and the salmon - farming sector .    3.8521972967807363
i hope that in accepting our proposal the european parliament acknowledges our commitment and i would be very grateful for that .    4.162347690784244
thank you very much , commissioner byrne .    2.589744572476388
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6351633559938676
protection of juvenile marine organisms    4.004828356529694
the next item is the report a5 - 0035 / 2000 by mr gallagher , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the proposal for a council regulation amending for the fourth time regulation ( ec ) no 1626 / 94 laying down certain technical measures for the conservation of fishery resources in the mediterranean and for the fourth time regulation ( ec ) no 850 / 98 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - 0040 / 2000 - 1999 / 0222 ( cns ) .    2.545188237590588
the proposal before us as outlined in the introduction is a very important one .    3.441952068920084
by now , my colleagues in the fisheries committee and indeed in the parliament will be well aware of our commitment to technical conservation measures which are based on sound technical advice .    3.795228490756628
the body charged with giving this advice based on sound scientific data is the international commission for the conservation of atlantic tuna .    3.382122335730723
this intergovernmental fishery organisation of which the european union is a member is responsible for the conservation of tuna and tuna - like species in the atlantic and the adjacent seas including the mediterranean .    3.6573056309048178
this body was established back in march 1969 and is formally obliged to meet UNK , however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice .    3.5278977677770906
the body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks .    3.4449572135478443
this body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics , finances and administration , compliance and conservation and management measures .    2.759579944082279
they have also four panels dealing with UNK tuna , with temperate tuna , the north and temperate tuna south and other species .    2.839891183075438
these panels are UNK to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention .    3.592613814376369
proposals made by the panels are then presented to the commission and the commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties .    4.701511378758008
these conditions are binding , however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six - month period .    2.9649723508282064
the european union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in community law .    2.901451783735263
at a iccat meeting in november 1998 in UNK de UNK , changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna .    3.451780988314476
iccat also made recommendations in 1974 , 1994 and 1996 .    3.4587049115815343
as of now , it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1 . 8 kilos .    3.612527643877365
at its recent meeting in november 1998 , the iccat standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western atlantic and eastern atlantic and mediterranean bluefin tuna populations .    3.4148925848821343
the information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans .    3.052567340295796
it was agreed that the scrs should present a study at the 1998 meeting . it was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to UNK sustainable UNK by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks .    2.978757073707949
it was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine , in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock .    3.074222430584296
following all of the research , the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 august to 31 august .    3.4015337323744284
it is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations .    2.9755643393153566
bluefin tuna is the world ' s most expensive fish UNK up to eur 90 000 per UNK at the UNK in UNK and , of course , the indication of the importance of the mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons .    4.465948882893691
80 percent of it was landed by purse seine .    3.1198722382154416
the mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles .    4.211475649807742
the minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age .    3.887588194947933
the measures agreed in november 1998 are binding since 21 june , i repeat 21 june 1999 , months before the communication was forwarded to the parliament ' s fisheries committee and 9 months almost to the date .    3.3670448223441003
now i believe , commissioner , this is not good enough and that in the future we must learn and that reports must be submitted to the parliament ' s fisheries committee before decisions are taken , otherwise then we are nothing further than a rubber stamp and i know that is not the intention of the commission or the commissioner but let us learn from mistakes of the past .    4.133541694395145
mr president , this proposal aims to incorporate into community law an iccat recommendation from 1998 which should have been binding from june 1999 , but which only reached this house at the end of last year .    3.258491622170976
the commission ' s legislative delay on certain issues should not surprise us , but for the fact that this is a recommendation from one of the most important international fisheries organisations on the protection of such a threatened resource as tuna .    4.033090262824044
the mediterranean , particularly in some zones , is an extremely important spawning area for the bluefin tuna which is of enormous commercial value .    3.994958404424834
this is why iccat recommended this closed zone in the adriatic and toughened the conditions for UNK zero - age fish .    3.012700119858635
however , i also agree with mr gallagher who felt bound to indicate his frustration at the UNK of the commission in getting into gear and transforming the recommendations into community law .    3.4898775878091377
we are , for example , still waiting for the proposal for a regulation on banning the import of bluefin tuna from UNK and UNK . the recommendation for this dates from 1996 .    3.8926623229529094
apparently , according to my information , the fisheries directorate - general sent a note last january to the trade directorate - general which is still on the preparatory work .    3.9506783862462336
four years to apply this ban on imports from countries known to favour flags of convenience is absolutely unacceptable .    3.2675901100354703
we have listened to the commission ' s explanations about the long internal process involved in transposing legislation . this has simply left us with an image of an UNK bureaucracy .    3.6052065324738143
yet i have my doubts about the only proposal currently on the table to improve this process which would involve doing away with the council and parliament procedure .    3.778514458668377
it is clear that we must find a solution to this problem , either at the time of the commission report on regional fisheries organisations or , if possible , before then .    3.9902267724582803
i do not suppose that anybody in this house would object to the principle of protecting juveniles of marine organisms .    3.6410594226408968
indeed , it is often stated that one of the general objectives of the common fisheries policy shall be to protect and conserve living marine aquatic resources .    3.6608999801931827
all laudable stuff .    3.322593231786604
there can also be no doubt that bluefin tuna is of enormous environmental and financial significance .    3.7477623454035047
as a king sport UNK myself , i would love to see the days of the 1930s come back when UNK from the port of UNK in yorkshire caught bluefin tuna weighing up to UNK pounds .    3.9345105553705766
i do not know what the metric equivalent is .    2.6124783850413387
so i support the findings of iccat and i support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues .    3.624367799705591
my concern though with this debate is that we are UNK whilst rome UNK .    4.843069511986319
the common fisheries policy is not working .    3.255688339194561
for all of the high - minded talk about conservation , the reality is that the quota system is directly leading to an environmental disaster .    3.999527422993162
in mixed fisheries , you cannot UNK .    3.4369477581227135
the sheer volume of fish that are thrown back dead also means that any improvement in fisheries data is meaningless .    3.2401356079568586
from a uk perspective there is also a deep - seated political objection to the cfp .    3.2764059650760116
many people now feel if this is federalism you can keep it .    3.2236542439727707
let me illustrate this with a topical example .    3.113231662482044
in february , commission regulation UNK / 2000 designed to protect irish sea cod stocks was issued .    3.626621547133976
the scientists and the fishermen both agree that something has to be done .    3.6443399035080524
however , more than a dozen large belgian UNK trawlers have been granted a derogation from this regulation so the vessels that caused the very problem in the first place are carrying on fishing whilst it is a criminal offence for the uk fleet to do so .    3.4595454632716995
the cfp does not assist in conservation and is UNK the british public to the point where we demand to re - establish control over our own territorial waters .    3.3811794809111797
these decisions must be defended by the commission in iccat . this is why our committee asked to be consulted in advance and to be represented at the meetings as an observer in order to ensure greater and better control and to reinforce the european parliament ' s role .    4.387707287301065
mr fischler , i am delighted that the commission responded favourably to our request in the last and constructive debate which we had on this issue and has asked to attend our next meeting this month to inform us about the future preparatory iccat meeting .    4.390314822904563
our rapporteur ' s criticisms on this point have also therefore been heeded .    3.7930190580823826
i must highlight the part of the report which states that , in 1975 , with regard to the size of bluefin tuna , a minimum limit of 6 . 4 kg with a 15 % tolerance in the number of fish was recommended for the entire atlantic .    3.8434925493357737
however , according to the scrs study , the regulation establishing the 6 . 4 kg minimum has been poorly enforced in the east atlantic and mediterranean fisheries .    3.282878902409631
the UNK reports that , according to italian , french and spanish customs authorities , illegal bluefin fishing and landings of small fish are on the increase .    3.092945584899101
i cannot and do not want to go any further as we are pushed for time .    3.9955370000990715
however , i must again congratulate our rapporteur , mr gallagher .    3.6362193033291157
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.8713701510554521
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6351633559938676
the next item is the report ( a5 - UNK / 2000 ) by mr varela suanzes - carpegna , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the second report from the commission to the council and the european parliament on the implementation of the " statement of conclusions from the intermediate ministerial meeting on the integration of fisheries and environmental issues , 13 - 14 march in bergen " ( com ( 1999 ) 270 - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cos ) .    3.0496956818855065
mr president , mr fischler , my report concerns the vital integration of environmental and fisheries issues , as discussed at the ministerial meeting in bergen .    3.393520209149826
this integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general .    4.3077838686411365
to fail in this respect would mean food for today but hunger for tomorrow , not just for our fishermen and the people of europe but , more seriously , for humanity as a whole .    3.967852608379241
the common fisheries policy is theoretically very demanding and very strict in this respect , perhaps more so than most people , both europeans and non - europeans , would believe .    3.5053370841011935
i have therefore asked the european commission to produce a publication which lists all the measures of the common fisheries policy aimed at UNK and protecting resources . this will serve to publicise our protectionist actions .    3.757168965984104
we have also asked parliament ' s own dg iv to prepare a systematic study of these measures for the committee on fisheries .    3.979664139405863
the revision of the common fisheries policy in 2002 is the biggest time - limited challenge facing us . we must completely overhaul , modernise or , if you prefer , update this policy in its entirety .    3.288474795675042
i would stress that the whole of the cfp must be revised , particularly the part on the protection of fish stocks .    4.057336137042655
this is the basis of my request to the european commission and the services of this house .    4.597500773104034
i do not want to and cannot go into too much detail , mr president , given the time constraints and also the interpreters ' UNK .    3.9322597783675284
however , i will just remind you that the meeting in bergen showed very significantly that a proper policy on the sea must be created .    3.495256615584299
the president - in - office informed our committee that the current portuguese presidency intended the cfp to be regarded as a policy for ensuring the sustainability of our resources . this must be our objective in europe and throughout the world .    3.7676677075928535
in this respect , important community initiatives arose from bergen which have always been supported by our committee . these are aimed at re - establishing the breeding UNK , reducing and adapting fishing effort to resources , protecting juveniles , species and their habitats and adopting technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fisheries .    2.9603270350982336
these initiatives , together with effective systems of control , are the key aspects for the future of fisheries .    4.617194162766316
however , we do not have to resort to extreme solutions , as mr katiforis initially suggested in his draft report .    3.5478000451210465
i am referring to this now because i will not have time to speak later on .    3.47819834103486
i must point out in this respect that it was the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by mr katiforis which enabled his report to be approved by our committee .    4.200201515815703
coincidence or fate has worked to bring together in this part - session both my report and mr katiforis ' s report on fisheries and the environment . the oral question from our committee on the extremely serious consequences for fisheries of the accident involving the tanker erika will also be considered tomorrow .    3.995069299064177
maritime transport , industrial and urban pollution and waste also have negative effects on fisheries whose problems do not just come from overfishing .    3.2254279639804175
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.8713701510554521
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6351633559938676
fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment    3.159541557201881
the next item is the report a5 - UNK / 2000 by mr katiforis , on behalf of the committee on fisheries , on the communication from the commission to the council and european parliament : fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment ( com ( 1999 ) UNK - c5 - UNK / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cos ) .    2.2517006569438975
the problems for resource management and environmental protection in the fishery sector have been considered by this house many times in the past .    3.437853510101398
this particular communication from the commission forms part of the commission ' s overall strategy of improving the integration of environmental considerations into other community policies .    4.170125348562569
the overall strategy of the commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over - exploitation and / or environmental degradation .    3.5351912720750374
the alternative to successful management is the economic decline of the fisheries industry as stocks UNK and demand for fish products is increasingly met by imports .    3.202091537784155
i understand i have been described in a spanish newspaper as an enemy of the fishing industry because i have said such things .    3.7644049605633176
of course , i am only an enemy of the fishing industry as much as anybody who recommends to some people not to saw off the branch on which they are sitting .    3.5050173413290806
this is an unwise policy .    2.9249597485074967
in particular , the communication calls for control of fisheries pressure to benefit commercial stocks and marine aqua systems , improved measures for nature conservation in the marine environment , in the UNK management of coastal areas , improved training , information transparency and a greater contribution from scientific research to fisheries management .    3.2297701685987303
all of the above priorities will be pursued equally at both the community level and in the various international fora in which the community UNK .    4.624001733654886
they should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the community UNK .    3.5882131853142054
whilst the communication reveals the commission ' s worthy intentions in this field , it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made .    4.644368100970807
one can quote from the communication .    3.3318591979900485
over - exploitation is so severe in community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent .    3.0279196959544588
that appeared in the communication published last july .    3.605538322080505
since then , the fisheries council meeting of 16 december decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000 .    2.9365744412546104
these are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over - exploitation .    2.9687299009766286
what can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities ?    3.4279031840398253
the first consideration must be to recognise that community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced .    3.5763523143256997
secondly , the principles of such community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the community is a party .    3.8636497006983537
thirdly , the european union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources .    3.1647980377105864
more controls would be placed to prevent oil UNK such as that of the erika in the bay of biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste UNK .    3.3755852368713
recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas .    3.360908262842119
such pressures are greatest in europe .    3.11714973856995
in this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches , fishing gear which destroys the UNK and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive UNK .    3.493918785031227
a quota management system such as that existing in new zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative .    3.293115570634802
under this system , and given the total allowable catch for a species , a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the UNK can trade amongst themselves , fish themselves or UNK the rights to other fishermen for a certain time .    3.601885428360225
the property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves .    4.723328082725048
such a market organisation can reap better long - term prospects for the fishing industry .    3.0926616961815423
at present dear colleagues , we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea , nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system .    3.8220467739952007
however , we should never blind ourselves to scientific research , we should never cease to gather information , we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and , if necessary , we should at least consider policy changes .    3.414274731565768
i therefore call upon the commission and the council to find the information , the political will to provide genuine long - term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short - UNK .    3.9632713424997013
i recommend the report to the house .    4.052028589015905
the environment committee is generally pleased with the commission ' s communication and we are also pleased that the fisheries committee adopted all our amendments .    4.084073341840125
it is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide - ranging and UNK than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by - catch .    2.855498684546658
we welcome the intention of the commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the eu including the common fisheries policy .    4.327858762633627
after all , the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into community policies .    3.7724074209594014
but as has been pointed out , the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial . this is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual .    3.8399993811876167
the un fish stocks agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard .    3.676770238686762
one aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control .    3.3376157850043797
all the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected .    3.7885825525897783
control is a member state competence and the council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries .    3.874058254135518
this is a good step forward , but as the commission and the fisheries committee continually point out , much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all member states .    4.107759040988555
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .    1.9211771456436049
mr president , fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment . most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire community regions .    3.0153674374968378
however , some people ' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic , ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and UNK .    3.488845599293179
i regret to say that this report , due to its link with the environment , seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular UNK .    4.5316154604230965
if mr katiforis ' s report had been approved in its initial wording , none of the members of the committee on fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being UNK .    3.676199164900563
the relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious .    3.660962774229556
yet it is very wide - ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport .    3.2840134210202705
to blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong .    3.1148831805038877
just when we thought the discussions had ended , a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which i ask you to vote against unreservedly .    3.657225367450678
according to these , for example , the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea .    3.1040453832533066
others , like amendment no 4 , which request financing for biological closures , also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force , although admittedly there is room for improvement in these .    3.4313524438209577
i therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee ' s debate . these two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks .    4.063921004941831
as i have said many times before , the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the erika .    4.044111846561752
mr president , mr katiforis ' s report has the virtue of having brought life , debate and controversy to a communication in which the european commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions , although recognising its inability to put these into practice .    3.2874754856537347
mr katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which , in his opinion , could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea .    3.953126280987762
yet i must say that i disagree with many of his proposals because i am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries .    4.265020214099171
i agree with the rapporteur that the european fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated .    3.510613382194457
however , what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the commission and the member states to take decisions and apply the current regulations .    3.740088903083798
maritime transport , employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment .    3.2533940894883417
as for the structural funds , certain examples could be mentioned but i will leave this for another day .    3.4387556595211515
the european parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries .    4.19940955862364
the commission and member states should be meticulous in respecting the tacs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria . the same yardstick should be used for everyone .    3.408602005581849
as mr katiforis says , discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept .    3.177117117191187
twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back .    3.1387473339263154
the fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear .    3.213846034235425
this house has already indicated its opposition to UNK and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the UNK of the national and community authorities .    4.0569142134199385
we socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector .    3.5679168381472475
it is therefore essential that the commission UNK an information campaign on the cfp with this message .    3.533520341622028
without a common fisheries policy there can only be lack of control , damage to the environment and an unsustainable economic activity .    3.979320565562441
mr president , i very much appreciate this report by mr katiforis on fisheries management and nature conservation in the marine environment .    2.6597784245883114
let us not forget that fish are at the very basis of our food chain and that the first ' environmental ' disaster , UNK disease , occurred in UNK in japan owing to the fact that fish were polluted by mercury .    3.811609079705596
we should therefore very carefully monitor pollution from industrial activity , but also from domestic activity .    3.5408763197066073
i do not believe that UNK emissions at sea , and particularly in a closed environment like the mediterranean , when we want to clean up purification plants , is a good way to clean up water .    3.99856847373118
we should pay particular attention to UNK pollution , to development , to the urbanisation of coastal areas , etc . but we should also think about restoring the environment and , for example , solving the problems associated with UNK UNK , and the areas of UNK that are disappearing and which must therefore be protected .    4.981090036094551
they say that if you want something done , it is best to do it yourself and so the users of the sea , the fishermen , must be very attentive .    4.885472012639559
it will certainly be necessary to reduce the amount of fish caught and the elimination of the surplus capacity between 30 and 40 % , as proposed by the commission , has been very greatly watered down by the council , to between 5 and 10 % .    3.6760732676133
it will also be necessary to undertake selective fishing and , together with my colleague , UNK UNK , who is also a former member of the european parliament , we would request a moratorium on the use of deep - sea trawlers in community waters in the bay of biscay , to the south of the UNK parallel north , because we have had enough of seeing UNK being washed up and dying on our beaches , particularly at the moment .    4.162948870398547
so we must practise selective fishing .    2.859372009864303
aquaculture should also be monitored .    4.724882843296539
read mr katiforis ' s report again , in which he says that in scotland , for example , 17 000 salmon are infected by the disease that i just mentioned , and impact upon the environment .    3.958795012985161
let us therefore take great care with work in a closed environment .    3.032135489728892
the council of europe is coming before the committee on industry , external trade , research and energy on 22 march to speak about the research work that must be undertaken , particularly in the marine environment and , more precisely , the scientific and economic challenges of exploiting the oceans .    3.5732176085831178
ladies and gentlemen , i would ask you to come and take part in this discussion .    3.4911137637849445
mr president , the katiforis report has been amended according to the proposals , notably , of the europe for a union of nations group , which were adopted in the committee on fisheries and , in my opinion , this version is an improvement on the original .    4.3644775393940565
i would like to touch briefly on these amendments .    2.8540991865350542
with regard to the installation of satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems , we feel that it is important for them to be installed on as many vessels as possible , although small vessels should not be compelled to carry them , of course , as investment and running costs would be disproportionately high compared to the value of the catches they make , and also in view of the fact that , in any case , satellite fishing vessel monitoring systems are not suitable or efficient for coastal fishing vessels .    3.4943720066885944
we welcome the report ' s rejection of the idea originally put forward by the rapporteur of creating a taxation system , as this would be impossible to implement and enforce for all the member states .    3.8743235318609286
moreover , with regard to the protection of coastal areas , which are the main breeding and spawning grounds for many species of fish , we hope for tighter controls , which , in our opinion , should be accompanied by penal sanctions for throwing unwanted catches back into the sea .    4.2235333060936835
in effect , this practice is responsible for a high death rate and is therefore incompatible with good fisheries management .    3.7668608179946137
more specifically , with regard to fisheries management in the mediterranean , we are all aware that fishing in the mediterranean is not governed by provisions on tacs .    4.001910663045338
and just as well , in my view .    4.041620003864981
as you may be aware , in contrast with the cold northern seas , the mediterranean is a small , warm sea where there are very few , if any , schools of only one species of fish .    3.4605800009747276
in our opinion , the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting tacs in the mediterranean is therefore inappropriate .    3.6284750169852447
lastly , we would vote for the amendments tabled by the confederal group of the european united left .    3.6393850929487566
we do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when UNK on fishing are in force : in short , we must make it possible to carry on a major , responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment .    3.5573168809403475
mr president , first of all , i am pleased that the katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment : pollution , UNK fishing , UNK platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of UNK damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore , and fishing is also a victim of this situation .    3.1898253020006586
the use of selective fishing gear which reduces UNK unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential , as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore , as well as in coastal waters .    3.2222815028085483
a reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation .    3.247446158828511
in addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene , the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors .    3.326281771362424
moreover , it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface UNK of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly : in reality , in some cases , small - scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources .    3.904253245175789
i am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources , and i also welcome the commission ' s request to propose the institution of a european UNK to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour , in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life .    3.9878452670044897
mr president , as a member of the verts / ale group , but also as a member of this parliament for galicia , i propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues . i shall , of course , be brief .    3.461916181314818
firstly , fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin .    3.1118869391881088
shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living , for without it , the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed .    3.573876533172462
secondly , it is true that a policy of preserving the marine environment must be practised both in community seas and in international waters or those belonging to third countries .    3.262582063487816
given this context , i would like to tell you about something that happened a few days ago .    3.4189078987575647
i discovered that the eu is using erdf resources to finance the construction of a UNK in UNK , in galicia , for UNK chemical and hydrocarbon products , on a site which will only employ three workers . this contravenes the ec environmental impact directive in relation to an estuary such as UNK , where 26 000 people earn a living from the UNK industry .    4.10675704082136
can i first of all congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report .    2.7251885315032176
conservation is something that i hear on many occasions and a lot of people pay lip service to it .    3.7311412550264453
a lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep .    3.8819339078618254
it is all very well to talk about conservation and i agree with it totally .    3.528866964492884
but at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where , when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the european union .    3.547753840839995
commissioner fischler , of course , knows me from a long time back and i have written to him on bse and many other issues in agriculture but now that he is responsible for fisheries i am going to have to UNK him on fisheries , along with his UNK colleagues , because one of the areas that has been most affected has been my region and the fishermen of northern ireland .    4.604387958645898
in actual fact they have had a moratorium imposed upon them without any UNK , without any real negotiation or discussion .    3.546554752564451
it has been imposed upon them that they cannot fish for about an 11 to 12 week period .    3.2134151383118366
now we all accept that there is a problem in conservation and a problem of stocks , but what i am really saying to you commissioner , and i have said this to you in the fisheries committee and i will say it to you again : there is a wide divide between brussels and the working fishermen .    4.388212090273675
it does not matter whether you come from galicia , it does not matter whether you are from northern ireland or whether you are from scotland .    3.0338136026675944
that UNK exists and we in brussels have not been able to cross that divide .    3.9527881838801853
and we have got to take on board the views of the fishermen .    3.1589911762740073
we have got to take on board the concerns of the fishermen and we have got to work closely with them and i hope that you , as the commissioner responsible for fisheries , will recognise that divide and will try and work as closely as you possibly can to ensure that all sides are brought together and their views are taken on board .    3.7774144220326407
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    1.8713701510554521
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6351633559938676
bankruptcy procedures    5.385450097377712
the next item is the report a5 - UNK / 2000 by mr lechner , on behalf of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , on the initiative of the federal republic of germany and the republic of finland , with a view to the adoption of a council regulation on insolvency proceedings ( UNK / 1999 - c5 - 0069 / 1999 - 1999 / UNK ( cns ) .    2.46397037051124
mr president , i think we all agree that a european legal area must be created .    3.3501311492122947
we also all agree that there should be harmonisation in a field that is marked by the great disparity of our legal systems and , what is more , concepts .    3.623018649842524
the very word bankruptcy , the legal concept of bankruptcy , does not cover the same accounting concept in each of the member states of the union .    3.309101675071074
we therefore all agree on the established facts , and the draft regulation and the report are going in the right direction .    3.7814628262697023
when you observe - and you cannot fail to do so - the disparity in the legal systems and concepts , and the fact that we wish to improve coordination , i believe that there are three ways in which we can proceed .    4.991284915505267
the first is to establish UNK , saying : in the final analysis , bankruptcy in france is the same thing as bankruptcy in england or in germany .    3.34325713032057
the second way is to recreate a law ex UNK , that is to say , to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the member states .    3.1845916439221598
that is not the route that has been taken .    3.4087239389460993
the third route that has been taken is in the end to UNK above the existing systems , which are not touched , a real UNK of community law of collective procedures and procedures for companies in difficulty .    4.325140541981603
this is a good thing , moreover , and the result has probably exceeded what the authors had hoped for .    3.419567568971152
but at this stage i should like to make an observation , which is not technical , but more philosophical and taken from practice .    4.435429967855556
it is that bankruptcy is experienced within the european union , in the majority of states , as an absolutely definitive event for the person it affects .    4.051920462638055
and i believe that it is our responsibility , in an ever more rapidly moving economy , where everyone must have a real opportunity , to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise , and a second and a third chance , if necessary .    4.184816223194989
today , in many member states , that is not possible .    5.029746111419393
one of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between the european area , for example and the united states , is precisely this ability of UNK back that exists on the other side of the atlantic and that we just do not have here .    4.915869360888005
i believe that since we have gone that far and we are continuing along that path , which is the route of creating a collective procedure for regulating this type of legal standard in the european union , we should bear in mind that it should not become the allegorical figure of the UNK .    4.345150416226915
mr president , commissioner , i believe , in fact , that it is more by luck than skill that there have not so far been any disasters due to the absence of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers .    4.022839903984497
when we deal with the positive side of the single market and create a common internal market , we must also deal with the darker side , namely bankruptcies .    4.262234861335089
i consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard .    3.879279809688136
i congratulate the rapporteur for having so quickly progressed further with his report .    3.4025761609825156
i am , moreover , proud that my own country has been involved in tabling this regulation which we now hope will swiftly be adopted by the council .    3.7127204644840472
i think it is an important step we are taking , even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it .    4.055340060326826
to the rapporteur ' s regret , i must unfortunately point out that our group cannot support amendment no 3 because we consider that it restricts UNK ' legal position and UNK their legal protection .    4.150510952479324
with regard to amendment no 6 , we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee . i am a little surprised that you in the group of the party of european socialists did not support it then .    3.5152095012469124
we shall now support your amendment no 6 , but i wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee .    3.670802530106202
i also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are UNK and best in the various countries .    4.342036232352949
. ( pt ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , first of all , the commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 convention on insolvency proceedings .    3.1543831245073632
as you all know , this convention was the result of many years of discussion , which was often difficult and often laborious , and that for this very reason , it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles , that is to say , the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our member states .    4.192073014977746
because we are aware that the developing global economic situation , and particularly the single market , can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings , which often take the form of cross - border proceedings , the union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles , thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly .    4.042366768846828
for better or for worse , the fact that businesses become UNK will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life .    3.5313276232811774
it will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business , which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the UNK of businesses that are no longer viable .    3.877475981635425
this is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy .    3.4789759107244875
it was not the commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two member states , germany and finland , by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which member states share with the commission on such issues .    4.6420137503645345
the commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the convention .    3.568881669179454
as far back as 1981 , the commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings .    4.297602016195414
furthermore , this view was accepted in the commission ' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses .    3.307302775100067
the 1995 convention , on the other hand , authorises the filing of secondary proceedings , thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the commission would like to see accepted .    4.081255444629189
following the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam , the commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted , one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings .    3.8534737732328077
nevertheless , i do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 convention which was , moreover , based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years .    3.5125702672483263
consequently , the commission has refrained from presenting an amendment . instead , it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues .    3.531276115159608
the commission feels , for this reason too , that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation , but i would nevertheless like to convey to you the commission ' s opinions on the amendments under discussion .    4.71438267748438
the commission therefore accepts amendments nos 1 , 2 , 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur , mr lechner .    3.2448122629681526
on the other hand , it does not accept amendment no 4 .    2.540850654687031
indeed , the commission feels that parliament should instead support amendment no 4 by the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the commission , assisted by a regulatory committee , in accordance with the on - going procedure of article 5 of decision 1999 / 468 / ec .    3.6388672099081782
therefore , with regard to the amendments proposed by the committee on citizens ' freedoms and rights , justice and home affairs , the commission accepts amendments nos 3 and 4 . on the other hand , it does not accept amendments nos 1 and 2 , on the idea of " centre of the UNK ' s main interests " .    3.9929546838477283
with regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person , this idea is clearly defined in article 3 .    3.474357426184421
in all other cases that have not been specifically addressed , we feel that the reference made in recital 13 should be sufficient .    3.737357728302543
thank you very much , commissioner vitorino .    2.4431061251146287
the debate is closed .    1.7115038518515047

shipwreck of the erika    5.240242096716943
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , firstly i want to warmly thank mr fischler for being here today .    2.7302940639844326
our president told us yesterday that the commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments .    3.4617248737956987
he must have reconsidered and , in so doing , has , as usual , shown great respect for this house . i thank him for this .    4.244726119852462
on behalf of the committee on fisheries , i must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker erika .    3.172832881327737
there are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue .    3.2742172864589714
firstly , we must show the commission , the council and the member states that this house cannot and will not forget about this serious incident .    4.945326219879473
secondly , we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster , namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions .    3.279280077700531
the UNK to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future .    3.4091999150410346
enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event .    3.643229094035284
we must now get down to adopting measures , commissioner .    3.3408816620046524
firstly , efficient controls are needed in community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport , particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved .    3.3323526446662095
the construction of these vessels , the use of double hulls , their age , their control by classification companies , insurance , the creation of databases containing all relevant information , community cooperation and coordination , the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled . who better than the european commission to make serious proposals for european harmonisation in these areas ?    3.588487618504004
flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport , particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling ' responsible fisheries ' .    3.920116338049061
access into community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet community safety standards must be controlled .    2.873858807271139
we expect concrete action from the european commission . the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of brittany and the vendée are particularly important , well - developed and prestigious .    3.248098830938643
the european commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage . it must also indicate all the specific measures , including political , economic , social and financial measures , which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected UNK .    3.864019983022446
how can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained ?    3.225719458328562
how can those affected be compensated ?    3.0858802289610265
this is a very serious problem which the european union , as an economic , commercial , industrial and fishing power , must tackle .    3.679354097126405
we must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and UNK .    3.8270759782445487
we must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future .    3.2407742183934305
this is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the committee on fisheries .    3.49356448073511
we hope to hear specific proposals from the commission , with plenty of action and no more regrets .    3.912570444203358
this house will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups .    3.3477822656075618
mr president , the shipwreck of the erika off the coast of brittany on 12 december caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years .    3.0222049480771696
in addition to destroying natural resources , this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors , particularly those dependent on fisheries .    3.3840629103762123
with 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the UNK vessel , the situation could still deteriorate .    3.83412070722327
the consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming UNK . these consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself .    3.350825050985494
the regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance . they have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which , unfortunately , is not an isolated event .    3.6972077319269463
the main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature , which is nowadays too often being punished by man ' s activities .    3.585882143073353
these events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities .    3.350253564285919
prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes .    3.0897725447228157
surely the budget would agree , as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these .    3.497630768389436
mr fischler says that he always comes to the house when asked .    3.6239922705319803
yet on the issue of the erika he has given the impression , perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of brittany and the vendée , that , as the fisheries commissioner , he is not always available or , at best , available only on a part - time basis .    4.143912237771485
as this house indicated in its first resolution on 20 january , the needs of the severely affected fisheries , ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account .    2.9159371408996417
we therefore now call upon the commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds .    4.155282744072308
galicia and brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks .    3.3120324261840035
we cannot understand how it is that experiences like the urquiola or amoco cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience .    3.3021818220187544
please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this .    3.6424093675086042
we must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen .    2.8452891519400416
the polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate .    3.0638891623284055
it is time that polluters started to pay because , up to now , it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid , and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well .    3.4765117628379936
i am therefore delighted at mr fischler ' s response , particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted .    3.5624348466936064
on behalf of the pse group , i want to send a message of solidarity to those affected , to the fishermen , farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market .    3.690234958659293
my message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians , to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support .    3.6349157328070896
i wish to put two questions to the commissioner .    3.849718515673589
parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable .    3.405492718367298
the question for the commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people .    3.765907354504329
the second point relates to the future and the publication of the commission ' s white paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce european environmental legislation properly .    3.88325924531115
the erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that white paper is seeking to address .    2.922447366210718
this question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future .    4.203978144317921
the proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by eu - regulated dangerous activities and my concern , and perhaps the commissioner can deal with this , is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of erika in future . will it really address the concern or will , in practice , in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas , the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause .    4.061315450111215
mr president , our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster , but good intentions are not enough , there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment .    3.6342146594240625
we are pleased to hear the commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation , and for this to be UNK .    3.8660083516433112
we also deplore the excessively UNK application of vessel inspection , and we are in favour of creating a european coast guard authority , and also , in particular , of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory .    3.839484042215116
we further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats .    3.842957967668476
finally , we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely UNK , with a UNK hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million .    3.6558042473771093
this means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products .    2.9584671572846983
this is not acceptable . we only found out too late and , as a result , medical inspection must be provided , paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment .    3.425665642414594
finally , we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks , as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage .    3.799811415689021
a great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation .    3.8830886942944924
solutions cannot be found at the last minute , when the disaster is already in progress .    4.193056135191185
consequently , the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand .    3.3213429210260825
mr president , over two months after the wreck of the erika , pollution of the coasts , which have already been cleaned once , is still continuing .    3.1706378108596516
while reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this , i should like to salute the dedication of the workers , professionals and volunteers , who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches .    3.841137371656714
thanks to the grass - roots involvement , which this house UNK by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 january , an initial raft of measures has been announced .    3.356888544406452
the french government has initiated a discussion and made proposals to strengthen maritime safety , particularly by fighting against the phenomenon of flags of convenience and by implementing much more extensive inspection .    3.349683424594752
the lessons of this latest oil slick must be learnt in full , and decisions must be taken speedily at community level to prevent coffin ships sailing off our shores or UNK in our ports , to make double hulls mandatory for the transportation of pollutants , and to strengthen standards for safety and inspection .    3.5191582340550074
we must also demand that the parties truly responsible be made to pay the costs incurred due to the pollution .    3.9167429049668474
so , yes , total fina must provide the financial resources to contribute to the repair of ecological , economic and social damage and to compensate the people affected by the disaster .    3.453201752172707
the french state has released funds for compensating damage .    2.965132552941126
i feel , however , that the european union has so far not actually come up with any expression of community solidarity at the requisite level .    3.7858392048438505
specific compensation should be provided for the fishermen and shellfish farmers who have suffered considerable loss of income and who face having to invest considerable sums in order to repair everything and regain consumer confidence .    3.362108906094813
i was pleased to hear the statement which commissioner fischler has just made , and i take careful note of the commitments he made before this house .    4.05238948932216
i should also like to say that my group shall remain vigilant and committed , in collaboration with the grass - roots action groups , to ensuring that the parties affected receive compensation as soon as possible and that legislation is strengthened at every level , supported by realistic penalties in the event of non - compliance .    3.2217402968861983
mr president , the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick , two and a half months after the wreck of the erika , is because the extent of the economic , social and ecological disaster affecting our atlantic coastline is , in fact , far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand .    3.592260968304793
UNK of tar are still washing in along 500 km of the atlantic coastline on a daily basis .    2.849944346844279
curiously , the exact composition of the cargo has still not been clarified .    3.235449077077363
the ecological disaster is a major one , possibly unprecedented in scale .    2.981966122888007
large - scale degassing UNK and the 16 000 tonnes of tar remaining in the wreck at a depth of 120 m present a major risk of fresh pollution .    3.369232876135358
all workers in the fishing , fish farming and aquaculture sectors have already been hit hard .    3.9090309971668575
the chief victims today are the shellfish farmers who were once the most successful producers in europe .    3.0093790019072015
the UNK victims are the producers or freight UNK banned in the vendée and loire - atlantique regions .    2.728357646978265
some of them have already lost several years ' worth of UNK , but the 50 % to 80 % slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the atlantic coastline , and even those in the channel and north sea .    3.6421062739387695
as regards fishing proper , passive gear fishing is currently the UNK hit .    3.0437014811657734
after shellfish , the slump is now affecting UNK sales .    3.05730011285006
the many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and , above all , the future of fishery products , an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years , now UNK entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs , unfortunately , of initial UNK .    3.7118164896797454
