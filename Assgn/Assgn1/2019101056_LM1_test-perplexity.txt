one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr UNK UNK , who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago .    58.32506353114866
the UNK report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually .    192.96440881915055
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 1998 ?    36.18818992610608
madam president , i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our UNK over today ' s decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia , considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past ?    112.57797202549402
so parliament should send a message , since that is the wish of the vast majority .    69.6936382139803
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide .    51.36458156370195
that did not happen .    11.931231030581564
madam president , first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has , at its heart , the issue of transport safety .    26.951728316950465
i would like , first of all , to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and , secondly , the commission for the proposal it has submitted .    29.82011842817833
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements .    53.21264974180819
however , when it comes to safety , i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in germany , italy or austria .    60.9893761969309
a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements , in particular for vacuum tanks , if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below - 20ºc . this is in the special interest of northern european regions .    185.24287330838885
consequently , i have tabled some amendments to mr koch ' s intrinsically excellent report , which have been adopted by our committee .    23.692276130664844
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far - reaching regional provisions .    116.11460935051211
mr president , it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the united kingdom that i represent in this parliament , namely wales .    79.7707050676183
mr president , i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague , mrs flautre , who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill .    40.05517145155673
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted , as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000 - 2006 programme .    47.30594014993355
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an UNK which is now being dealt with constructively .    64.6195572325548
the consequences do not inspire hope .    34.65409310771877
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union .    15.23850514591065
small and medium - sized businesses , above all , need to take part in the distribution of these funds .    36.03651932008246
my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today .    36.81551132059443
i would like to think that , given his previous experience as a regional president , he will agree to propose indicators , and a strategy , which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity .    104.69992434587647
the social fund has certainly improved our third - level institutions , financed our post - leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long - term unemployment , assist early school UNK and promote higher standards of UNK UNK .    82.14841225747112
finally , we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed .    48.78685586136607
in closing , i would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium , for which we all hope for the best .    97.67696728853379
the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been UNK damaged by the existing regional policy , which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers , particularly in the south .    143.47171072946907
in future , we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as , in my country , the islands of the azores and madeira .    45.9463203271771
the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use , to the optimum and efficient use , as some of you have wished , of community involvement , including , mr UNK , using , if necessary , the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies .    118.10534865398628
i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 november and , within the college , we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions . i would thank you for your understanding in this matter .    79.87818829684045
you then mentioned , mrs schroedter , the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development , pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration .    97.55164507627602
in this respect , i am pleased to see that the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism has adopted one of my amendments calling on the commission to devote a specific chapter in its next report on cohesion to the special case of the most remote regions and , more specifically , to consideration of the impact of the measures shortly to be adopted under new article 299 ( 2 ) of the treaty of amsterdam .    38.83646929210482
the european commission ' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions .    32.95562080616252
we now require an in - depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas .    68.1231173146397
some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased .    64.55292932861465
in this connection , too , weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development .    63.76474264276535
concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand - orientated economic policy is not the answer .    68.29563735620495
i should also like to make a few comments , firstly , mr berend , regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report .    22.537346817138335
i do not wish to spend time right now , mr berend , going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed .    84.83528890484916
finally , i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are , in any case , familiar with , but whose main elements i should like to reiterate .    41.52198618158492
i am thinking in particular of the pre - accession structural instrument , which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks .    12.109393530129708
i should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines , as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000 - 2006 .    43.14712046016948
( the sitting was closed at 8 . 25 p . m . )    3.820567593715129
the european commission ' s decisions , which feature in the report , are welcomed by the european parliament , as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases , thus applying article 88 of the ecsc treaty .    50.800279735480956
the reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires , they will be able to do their own thing again without the UNK of the european commission ' s supervision .    50.01878222883402
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time , but then it happens again .    50.74544202796653
on the market , the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties , consumers and workers .    59.5761813551773
i want to thank you , commissioner monti , for your outstanding cooperation and i want to tell you that , as we enter the new millennium , you have an especially important role .    39.03534318326154
mr president , commissioner , there are just two questions which must be answered .    26.171729322625907
mr president , commissioner , in the course of this pivotal year , prior to the changeover to the single currency , the commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment .    53.89123765190668
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense .    59.74279398102204
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into first - class players in the league of the internal market ?    152.7245250726623
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis .    16.609262111291752
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals .    27.935529306499554
because , if this is not the case , we will be faced with the paradox that the commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the european internal market .    37.56402177893733
i therefore believe that something is missing and i suggest that we establish more regulations , lay down clear rules , which will benefit all of us : businesspeople , investors , workers and the citizens in general .    86.7343088683658
from the point of view of economic growth , and therefore of increasing employment and wealth , safeguarding a competition policy in the member states is becoming a crucial factor , and one that is certainly very important for our future .    47.28527333890178
so although i may not share his conclusions , i believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the commission must address .    196.46664258416018
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures .    24.035221217492612
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper .    81.60567421154
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system .    45.869992921372265
firstly , it is necessary , in drawing up the legislation , to produce clear and complete rules .    40.08557702139461
many of the report ' s conclusions , however , are cause for concern , at least for our group .    34.88979037395654
for example , state guarantees , on which the commission has just publicised its position , must naturally be considered state aid , but they are , in my opinion , a better option than granting aid directly to companies .    59.813374186163706
thirdly , we have the problem of the uniform application of community law .    13.973478474678373
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i heartily congratulate the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the entire european parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition - related subjects .    33.031013329909
the current notification instrument , ladies and gentlemen , no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - i would remind you that , in 35 years , there have only been nine cases in which the commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which , in the majority of cases , receive a simple comfort letter .    97.914777074785
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy .    43.30674609448446
the reform does not entail any reduction in the commission ' s activities , but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers .    136.06571347700424
so , the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being UNK and taking root in the european competition culture - where today various small plants thrive , and they are certainly not all the same .    65.49215469093431
why ?    10.540204851978832
no .    4.0136708111652215
legal certainty is important for businesses : this is a subject , the importance of which the chair of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market , mrs palacio vallelersundi , emphasised in her last intervention - and i am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market , including , in this case , competition .    72.72140504029824
let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982 , as you know better than i . this ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any UNK thereof .    111.35930446129235
mr president , i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato .    19.51076902829671
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that UNK so many frontiers ?    132.71173994797076
the court of auditors UNK its report , which UNK the member states on account of various incidences of fraud .    39.515552616817985
but the idea of a european public prosecutor , on the other hand , aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters .    30.522416443211355
the intergovernmental conference 2000 will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this .    69.53763310766294
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust , as proposed at the last summit .    83.83137226374608
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .    62.3593336124993
i feel that we must clearly safeguard the community ' s interests , its image and its relationship with taxpayers , who are an indispensable and essential part of community life .    102.09786574151346
after all , there is no longer mention of a european public prosecutor , rather , for legal reasons it has now become an independent , european authority , or " body " to quote mrs theato .    101.38007311644486
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis .    17.876447554394122
is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying , in legal terms , the creation of a specifically community - wide criminal law which , although it might be called subsidiary , will always clash with the practice , and in certain areas , with the traditional , separate criminal law of the member states ?    129.2053224944919
in other words , there is a loophole here which must be filled and i will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on .    74.841665067631
( parliament adopted the resolution )    1.812828480388601
report ( a5 - 0087 / 1999 ) by mr jonckheer , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors ( com ( 1999 ) 148 - c5 - 0107 / 1999 - 1999 / 2110 ( cos )    3.9317852532398505
report ( a5 - 0073 / 1999 ) by mr langen , on behalf of the committee on economic and monetary affairs , on the commission report on the implementation in 1998 of commission decision no 2496 / 96 / ecsc of 18 december 1996 establishing community rules for state aid to the steel industry ( steel aid code ) ( com ( 1999 ) 94 - c5 - 0104 / 1999 - 1999 / 2107 ( cos )    4.335761834088794
it shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources , the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the commission .    71.66269710652435
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation , regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport .    178.2860386118186
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .    58.00813223621644
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year .    68.29173704590006
this is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national , european and local funding .    168.4732647282127
in all such cases , however , strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained .    161.72973502576988
in general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .    65.73269327617166
rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in , by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration .    136.46856602442818
in conclusion , the document is not particularly satisfactory , and in some aspects is disappointing .    42.40464682248249
this situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the member states , which is what the report proposes .    70.61870451766241
indeed , the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system .    60.76270687417928
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible .    13.427394233437951
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state .    14.318076743836187
oil slick off the french coast    46.25289258372623
the pictures many of us will have seen of oil - UNK birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic .    124.97817035412719
among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year , 15 were at least 20 years old and some were 30 and more .    152.62300260576416
the erika , a vessel flying a maltese flag , a UNK rust UNK , classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers , has contaminated more than 400 km of our coastline , a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the amoco cadiz .    137.9579095429044
mr president , may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear , adequate and , at the same time , very firm response .    32.579641437416846
mr president , i would welcome some action in this area .    9.923041330709417
in the fifth place , we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the european union , and incidentally , that includes the candidate countries .    93.15544225734908
there are reputable companies too .    44.19374197781839
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals .    120.61688786940059
mr president , i would like to thank my socialist colleagues , mainly in the committees on transport and the environment , who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry .    39.55900602027356
in addition , i should like to make a number of comments :    8.364997783437719
i think that given the dramatic circumstances , and as a matter of principle , it would be ill - advised and inappropriate to hold several votes .    61.49209665485773
i have almost finished and i would like to say that i have personally requested a public hearing of the committee on transport , which would enable us to provide an immediate follow - up to the erika case and to suggest possible future considerations .    42.11005471143042
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors , esteemed european commission ?    61.00727152089953
construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of UNK was especially high .    168.53408498932305
we are therefore right to demand improved controls , sanctions and preventive measures .    68.41614417334931
i have been fighting for a european environmental coastguard service for almost ten years , here in parliament .    31.91669625052461
mr president , firstly i would like to express my very sincere thanks , not only for the initiatives of the different groups , of mrs grossetête and the group of the european people ' s party ( christian democrats ) and the european democrats , but also for the initiatives of mr wurtz and the confederal group of the united left / nordic green left , who proposed this debate , which has led to a positive and important discussion .    27.263166019930598
there are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas . they are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium .    165.1068250260441
as for the inspections , very much a key question , the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked , as mr hatzidakis has said .    77.63589709745341
unfortunately , the 25 % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements : in this way inspections are UNK and the work is carried out more easily .    111.88947951421741
storms in europe    86.22668733290233
the community action programme for civil protection , established by a council decision on 9 december , was launched on 1 january 2000 .    55.69597787385038
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over .    55.568180032455366
i have listened to you very attentively commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in france and in germany .    97.18232617398054
it knows the UNK and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority .    132.68750806060694
that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities , in general terms , are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years .    69.52650858274771
it is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical , active solidarity .    88.56493944161474
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the UNK weather arrives .    19.726367013494542
in saying all of this , i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems .    50.763868122790896
it has already attracted much comment , including reactions from members of parliament .    33.09790896066487
how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well - founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety ?    171.18876576109514
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the european union .    33.84584028709942
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues .    40.942686137168096
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard .    13.68981528497029
the new legal framework will cover animal feed , animal health and welfare , hygiene , UNK and residues , novel food , additives , UNK , packaging and UNK .    216.35322573869607
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate .    20.850225696009083
mr president , i thank the commissioner for his statement .    4.510176323722449
that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability .    104.87358246851372
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration .    43.51324122618566
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation .    33.236096984644746
it is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation , although that is part of it , but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them .    97.11954166449382
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months .    19.81883825684054
that is my judgement at the moment .    9.366409714313729
however , this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium .    66.47205857562842
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south - eastern europe . a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed .    141.64788190740234
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous .    31.60178899905136
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama .    31.036038306793234
however , if your response was to be that we should turn to " mr cfsp " , that is , to mr solana , then i fear that this would constitute a one - sided approach to an external policy matter .    73.74060852025401
if i can make a literary UNK to the honourable member , who i recognise is interested in these subjects , i recommend to him a book published just before christmas written by isabel UNK , the distinguished journalist , on the problems of tibet .    145.79119845147838
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document , a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks .    45.698188804344014
this limited training element has , however , been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times .    61.47194481177213
thank you very much , mr patten , for your interventions today .    13.512967408564506
could the commission say whether the greek government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long - term unemployment , and what these commitments are ? has the government UNK for and put into place a suitable system for UNK , recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment , or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work ?    179.22074677576586
in the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006 , which is being financed from the social fund , both the resources and the policies should be used , with the commission ' s support , to implement the objectives which i referred to earlier .    77.67782271741233
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the commission .    19.708655660559945
question no 38 by ( h - 0805 / 99 ) :    12.41195997764573
in a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .    194.86379319951862
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe .    34.51543221712876
it would be interesting to hear whether the commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have UNK , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them .    138.62163400252274
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0004 / 2000 ) by mrs van der laan , on behalf of the committee on budgetary control , on giving discharge to the commission in respect of the implementation of the general budget of the european communities for the 1997 financial year ( section i - parliament , ii - council , iii - commission , iv - court of justice and v - court of auditors ) [ sec ( 1998 ) 520 - c4 - UNK / 1998 , sec ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1998 , sec ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1999 ]    83.30754369664479
nevertheless , i recommend that we start , in the hope that the commissioner will be able to follow the debate , and particularly the rapporteur ' s speech , from her office , if that is where she still is .    54.63191733838766
it is unacceptable that the commission completed the construction of a hospital in 1996 and that , as yet , it has been left UNK .    71.39534706411932
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it is also open and democratic .    53.41752326644248
there are two issues i would like to draw your attention to .    6.356730124167223
we need from the commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending .    81.76222331848314
it is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also UNK .    32.81177160268709
i express the hope that - in fact , i urge the present commission to ensure that - the 1997 discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the commission . otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value .    127.08625741622949
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for 1998 to check whether efficiency , transparency and accountability , and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information , are being displayed vis - à - vis the discharge authority .    69.41209637115394
mr president , we all recall that parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year pending commitments from the new european commission regarding internal reform .    62.17857475758095
however , the reform of the european commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run - up to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference and the reform of various eu policies and initiatives .    31.42722809099496
i have no doubt further reform of eu institutions will be analysed in this debate .    36.18813030454487
mr president , this time last year the european parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by mr UNK to investigate allegations of fraud , nepotism and corruption in the european commission .    69.51417146376505
the commission ' s dgs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure , including financial control .    55.66194366963399
the political crisis which led to the downfall of the commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct .    84.29886338892814
the social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue .    49.51587432252025
the UNK procedure must be made fairer and more transparent .    42.683544521464555
commissioner kinnock will , tomorrow , present his communication on reform .    78.76462126409675
members of parliament must UNK the qualities of morality , discipline and discretion over delegated issues UNK , and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else .    157.86265091358766
i would point out that there is no european legal system , but that a different legal system exists in each member state .    21.784422561454036
we run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways .    92.05026862817454
the knowledge that the framework relations between the european parliament and the european commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee .    92.856158982409
we have UNK a few amendments which fell in committee , in particular , our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you , commissioner , accepted - when we had our hearings last september - should be included in these codes of conduct , particularly when considering appointments and promotion .    221.48495139507867
central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility .    202.65708024099334
this has also been partly dealt with in the van hulten report . i think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented .    58.123485656065505
mr president , a year has not yet passed , but it is already clear that parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently .    101.04503297315838
it is of no concern to the major groups in parliament , nor to the majority of the trade unions , who are busy discussing the defence of european public administration , but , in practice , are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members , putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use .    105.57512954292424
trade union representatives sit on the disciplinary board and the staff regulations committee , thereby making it impossible to remove UNK officials and preserving the staff regulations in their UNK state .    234.28686098563816
i do not have exact figures , but the community ' s budgetary discipline and the associated implementing provisions apply to almost 100 different areas of responsibility of the financial controller , to his or her independence and the tasks assigned to this office .    124.85646819337904
when the commission ' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 march , i very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change .    81.66676282728326
this is the best support we can give to european democracy .    29.530986635587663
the financial controller is no longer to make advance checks , if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the commission .    84.59582564610257
there are too many rights , too many regulations and too little room for leadership .    82.765391507607
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work .    21.271163670554607
the commission does not have enough staff .    14.755455760380293
i find it a little worrying that people are UNK for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision - making is to be exercised .    128.06159324201545
in this , their second report , the experts tell us that italy is financed by the cohesion fund , that the erdf and the social fund represent two - thirds of the structural funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the structural funds come to the same thing . they tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the eaggf - guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the commission and to the member states .    107.95085517450266
i do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here , but , for this type of resolution it certainly does .    78.47398377560829
that service will open on 1 may this year .    44.13562591052086
before leaving this area i would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months .    88.29291616905252
the draft resolution rightly UNK the commission ' s accountability to this parliament .    24.661756169443276
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this house .    33.47526414556361
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law .    55.30244883353347
it is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the UNK of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace .    81.50066458914291
i would like to tell him that communications with madrid are usually more fluid and , therefore , i hope to see him there soon .    44.668830720126984
an important question in this context is the future distribution of water .    42.7886047684069
the moment of truth is approaching .    28.251313241043533
but today , egypt , jordan and palestine have peace treaties with israel .    66.06608607721377
i know that if agreement can be reached between syria and israel , the israeli prime minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with syria in any future referendum .    72.33448461197409
at present , the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first , while the israeli government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security .    113.15639080744528
indeed , the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability .    27.811660446758875
mr president , the israeli author , UNK oz , managed to capture very aptly the UNK atmosphere at the negotiating table between the israelis and syrians recently .    83.80706559351627
all the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater european involvement in the peace process .    46.396831887977214
first , i believe that we can welcome the agreement between israel and the palestinian authorities .    11.867202927128035
however , we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium , so as to give a fresh impetus , while preserving continuity , to the work done under the previous action plan .    49.775836104535756
the union ' s commitment to establishing an area of freedom , security and justice was confirmed at tampere .    16.434581666582158
in addition to these events , i would like to remind parliament of some items that were approved in 1999 .    26.85578938653962
in 1999 , europol took up its duties and we in the commission , UNK the portuguese presidency ' s statement today , sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to europol under the treaty of amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between europol and the relevant judicial institutions , and in particular eurojust .    76.56955836841826
i also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and UNK up cross - border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims , UNK claims and non - contested claims .    142.15054157738834
first : a common asylum law must be created and the burden of UNK refugees must be distributed .    60.788518873991514
we are not just calling for more control , and more control over europol ; our UNK here is " less is sometimes more ! "    114.25950835855237
i hope that it works out .    14.766077746150868
regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding .    47.6772133596018
care must be taken to ensure that the council complies with parliament ' s modus operandi .    149.54338808930356
they were treated like the worst criminals .    34.48406430470489
behind this lies another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house , namely to introduce such an area .    68.13146852200978
the tune that will be played will be one that the people of europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune .    189.31738589640176
we accept the UNK role of the council in this , but there are reservations and i am sure that the council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail .    77.39952779749049
a scoreboard tells people the score ; it has to be up - to - date and it has to be clear and visible .    46.47603551051241
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see .    21.08526664943258
we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense .    34.88274682941546
however , i would just like to add the following .    11.746285788212836
i believe that the commission ' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function , but i think that there is always room for improvement in this matter .    37.50134736195646
we have a principle of transparency in sweden which UNK democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens , decision makers and authorities .    131.02643765636
what measures does the council intend to adopt , and when , with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks , the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability ?    62.01430145016775
fishing quota transfers between portugal and france were reduced UNK from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000 , for fishing in french waters .    163.33453129765303
we have fully supported the efforts of the united nations mission and the international security forces in kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat .    110.62289408213486
i completely understand your concerns , and i feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the european union itself on this issue .    52.32304919566418
in specific terms , we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the commission for the next round of wto negotiations , at which this will be a central issue .    50.92480647834592
we will soon see , and for our part , we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue .    48.86734561931635
mr president , i join others in wishing portugal every good wish for a successful presidency .    53.28420164072853
after this interesting exchange of opinions , and in accordance with the rules of procedure , i would like to tell you that questions nos 17 to 27 will be replied to in writing .    22.0987534146275
the bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments .    139.18474035615597
in view of this situation , renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by UNK tobin , winner of the nobel prize for economics , to create a tax on currency transactions . the rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments , but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation , thereby checking the multiplication of short - term transactions .    181.08635344303573
the common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the european union . this is the reason for the oral question to the council and commission which we have tabled with 37 other members .    72.21919337973662
in that case , the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity .    41.914620830310575
the capital markets do not want uncertainty from us , they want clarity ; which is why we reject point 9 and call for a split vote .    142.44285939098782
no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information .    99.82757303535449
i thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on .    41.54571497314826
in order to fully achieve its objective , the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries .    50.81283574102131
the fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains .    119.74637397387963
it is not correct that the tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer .    81.15000530235383
who is going to defend these speculators , when UNK and teachers are paying top rates of tax ?    79.53515734852705
the union should make a tax pact , which any countries could initially be party to .    43.66391018602682
he said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon , and i share his view .    85.47709176822532
a second remark made by mr gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates .    83.52815517949793
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market , i am , in other words , opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions .    30.81127663107058
we can do so without going off at other UNK . i respect you as a serious commissioner who wants to take his work seriously .    117.57811602469492
i therefore appeal to the president of this house and the president of the commission for them to stand UNK for immediate compensation from the u . s . authorities , and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims ' families .    39.204047890450305
if you ratify .    12.656048286092473
do forgive me .    55.63148774524648
that is what i am asking president prodi for at this moment .    22.730394939576023
with all due respect to a commissioner as effective as mr fischler , and given that we have heard contradictory comments , depending on the translation , with regard to a possible request by president prodi for the resignation of mr fischler , i would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this house .    72.32503124877093
of course , we cannot violate the founding values of europe , and in this regard , the italian prime minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty : he mentioned the treaty of copenhagen , which i , like you , have never heard of because it does not exist .    130.62468390566147
we could mention , my belgian friends , belgium and the dutroux case , the dozens upon dozens of children UNK , tortured , raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country , where inquiries are bogged down , making no headway .    148.04316029815723
we could , if one third of the members of parliament so requested , require that the council and the commission look into the matter .    22.582048465445904
we might well wonder why 76 % of belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56 % of french citizens have no confidence in their country ' s system of justice , and 53 % of italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in italian justice .    126.88295456396553
my party at home are certainly not UNK , but we do not accept the rule or interference of the european union very well .    53.256224432899046
my party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of european politics and continues to be rooted in the european community of values !    147.89711044375255
the argument that mr poettering himself used has come into play , i . e . that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his UNK if he were to be integrated into the political system .    87.68040925474052
madam president , i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group , francis wurtz , reminded us of just now .    33.06004052840029
of course , the treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable ; i was almost going to say ' irreparable ' .    71.79121774970518
madam president , as everyone has said , this is a very important day . it is the day of the first debate of european political life .    32.55305754909539
the christian democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme - right voters but never to negotiate with extreme - right leaders .    246.39502126826508
we keep reminding them about article 6 of the treaty .    19.019726204533104
thirdly , we expressed , in very explicit terms , that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of article 6 of the treaty ; and that we will take our part under article 7 of the treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld .    118.95692623311882
anyone , therefore , who invites franz fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is austrian , should examine their own motives in the context of a debate , which has been necessarily UNK by references to xenophobia and even more UNK UNK in this world .    113.02233236238654
does the commission support the council ?    17.024180984799266
it involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear , but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action .    129.66722907144643
and they must be consistent with similar measures already taken .    49.09896472587247
for example , if one product has been approved , similar products should also be approved .    35.63581894829437
i am sure that your answer to this will be " yes " but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be ?    64.98704632374823
needless to say , this accords science a great deal of power .    31.529533809764878
the council ?    4.222080866905818
what , also , will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up ?    97.50217477174272
well , that depends on who the legislators are .    70.53169461046343
however , it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle .    17.330606993301473
this is because the institutional framework within which europe will operate in the future is a foundation of european integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the union ' s member states .    44.12765924545748
it is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .    53.9016235552227
however , we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place , precisely in order to facilitate enlargement .    45.03023933692853
these first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our member states during the last igc .    226.37413960360516
the parliament , the council presidency and the commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda .    50.72970809393309
we should no longer be worried that the agenda for the igc will be restricted .    18.878096830251792
another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside european union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build european parliamentary democracy .    179.776528692288
i believe it falls to you , as president - in - office of the council , to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before , leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were UNK as to the content of the treaties .    32.34463298754843
there is another central issue relating to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to .    36.05816138903012
i would like to thank the commission for the proposals they have put forward and i am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will UNK here in the european parliament , on all the issues you have raised .    39.36660587237204
brussels knows best .    48.620516632674764
i want to ask mr prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the house which is not , at the same time , available for critical scrutiny by the public .    57.674876689772596
mr prodi secured positive comments for a proposal which would otherwise have been met with criticism , for the new draft regulation presents as progress the fact that it will now be possible to grant right of access to documents in the commission ' s possession . there follows , however , a long , long list of exceptions , and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions .    186.8570077242132
the french text contains the word " refuse " and the english text the word " shall " , which means that the commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public , for example in my own country .    82.13064753032062
the portuguese presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter , perhaps to extend the mandate .    67.83251181958398
the aim was not to draw conclusions - it was impossible to draw any - but the debate was certainly very encouraging .    81.36251531522636
if there is a democratic deficit at the end of this igc , then i say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this .    49.847124775760044
whether we want it or not , since parliament itself is going to UNK the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates , the UNK for decisions is now going to move to the 15 member states of the union .    95.34410347113233
it makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive , and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing .    69.74969154271352
the council has done well to lay open this subject to europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a charter of fundamental rights , in a european constitution , then we shall construct a europe without a solid , lasting base .    93.4862972856946
in other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important " amsterdam leftovers " .    21.466326428410035
must there be an igc ?    88.99729575461903
mr president , ladies and gentlemen of the house , at this stage , following this debate which i have listened to most attentively and with great interest , i should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of president prodi .    32.62118462438608
as far as we are concerned - i am responding to mr seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects , even though i do consider them as priorities , and consider that they must be dealt with now .    78.61237538293562
both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for eu enterprises .    32.47459582985758
turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments , one of the essential differences is that , in place of a " service provision card plus notification for each individual contract " system , provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract .    168.61279987414304
i must say i have received extremely contradictory statements from parliament ' s services as to exactly how these council decisions should be quoted ; whether or not one should use the number or date alone , or both , and how extensively to quote from them .    169.27093260969468
the commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards .    50.6386365881298
it seems over the top to us for other member states to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards .    124.17966581588257
if a particular member state was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country , then this particular member state would be able to UNK this card , as it were , for the reasons cited in this directive , which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution .    149.9502588621094
that is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger .    74.60523242755175
there are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .    25.841742851462964
why do i think we need the directive so much ?    26.391700031975226
we also welcome amendment no 13 insofar as , as a result of this , the card ' s area of applicability is extended from one member state to all member states .    38.05805370336966
i regret that the commission has found amendment no 10 to be unacceptable as far as the three - month period and the role of the member state in which the service is provided are concerned .    20.864651446348063
as amendment no 18 refers to directive 96 / 71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force , no change is necessary .    91.75467783323343
acceptance of amendment no 17 by the commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued .    173.18696692442333
we have to offer solutions which , while provisional , help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice .    56.539221626166416
furthermore , if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them , what happens , as madame palacio vallelersundi has already pointed out , is that justice delayed becomes , as we know , justice denied .    98.90001146787273
in the light of this sympathy , i would like to continue my response as follows .    37.56837768360069
although there is much that is good about the new directive , it is nonetheless not without its defects .    62.99365719362145
if peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable , non - fossil energy source , it must form its own class , especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned .    204.06276269866345
in this respect , the altener programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment , and help us to realise our ambition , in the interests of environmental protection , the economy and creating new jobs .    62.7935601775019
may i also venture to raise the matter of peat ?    148.77488431280793
in order to ensure that at least 50 % of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources , it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term .    37.76040588643673
it is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables .    94.4429486586866
i support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions , including the energy sector .    131.44878591321523
i hope that you will all agree that this is important progress .    18.71686383930564
i would like to say however that it is , and has always been , a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real .    78.28966791076627
it is something that we can all support .    12.580354017122474
on the other hand , it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this parliament , which were minimal anyway .    47.42964234850503
congratulations !    54.77951167547652
finally , i would like to congratulate commissioner reding , vice - president imbeni and mr gargani , chairman of the committee on culture , for the firm and intelligent position which , each within his own role , they have maintained during the entire conciliation process .    80.92347865490926
however , it is not under threat from europe .    17.62294784913343
the battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years , and now , at long last , the european parliament can give the go - ahead .    33.416192788006775
thank you , commissioner .    2.0609940853014184
this too is a particular desire of my group .    20.026364993134727
a car has dangerous components which we must ban long - term .    95.91642745864127
there are a number of sound amendments .    15.159182550543031
all the same , there is one point on which we are in conflict .    18.186040271771226
we must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer , as stipulated in the common position .    35.753634090090735
no , according to the christian democrats in amendment no . 38 : car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50 / 50 .    122.31111443720022
it is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50 / 50 compromise is included that this does not work .    59.678713842422404
i would therefore urge my colleagues not to support amendment no 38 of the christian democrats and amendment no 45 of some of the socialists .    28.295090868601548
this will either be the century of waste management or it will not .    59.262676821744094
finally , this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity .    19.490311115255736
we shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result .    18.554027077262166
whatever system is adopted , ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer .    47.134312130209516
the free recovery system , for example , for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly .    116.74489381638091
it fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow UNK from the greens says that this is the first time that the european parliament has toned down a common position , i really must object , because quite simply , it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern , low - consumption cars such as the 3 - litre car , which contain a great deal of plastic , by means of rigid , high recycling quotas !    253.74813933268993
the objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation .    69.66034809252166
the second principle in the council ' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive .    10.536822484376403
this is a very environmentally reasonable approach .    22.113966497299522
this method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the " dead " car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and UNK process .    213.54382304356764
would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes .    15.486508194196569
allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate .    30.827450067763788
the first question , then , is about who should pay .    17.440921178857
do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ?    83.70525044062938
clearly , we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars .    77.37005930651164
this applies to amendment no 5 , excluding section 1 ; 8 and 9 , section 1 ; 10 and 12 , section 3 ; 15 , 16 , 20 , 22 , 24 and 25 .    89.01245696146134
it would UNK and UNK me if it were not to do so today .    31.93747583900436
madam president , as you know , the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors , particularly in the french version .    46.43578797914028
in the english version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations .    33.58976244936152
i do not know whether this is in order , and i would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the house .    38.19598485143705
report ( a5 - 0018 / 2000 ) by mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the convening of the intergovernmental conference ( 14094 / 1999 - c5 - 0341 / 1999 - 1999 / 0825 ( cns )    4.042122774252826
explanations of vote    3.934577174318191
furthermore , like the rapporteur , i think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields .    98.40401143316802
we must incorporate the gender factor in science , research and all other european union policies , in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market .    52.35556283435923
i am pleased to see that the debate on mrs mcnally ' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women ' s participation in professions in research and science , met with a fairly wide consensus .    46.88761362019048
second reading of the florenz report ( a5 - 0006 / 2000 )    12.962825224072482
this cannot be a good thing in a european union where we are ever mindful of employment .    23.11233935046898
that is why i voted in favour of the amendments .    3.2028917265239585
in this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations .    30.99322543447961
instead , it should leave member states to develop their own systems , and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good .    133.98222530597124
nevertheless , the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another member state when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence . this means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the member state to which they were posted .    127.76563688104812
beyond this , we have concerns that the " flexibility " or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present .    70.5675167931378
the most important task of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states .    4.275723672614746
the government of the united states , or of israel ?    29.348252010989828
what , then , are the values of these socialists who UNK their electoral UNK in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in UNK UNK for the benefit of the UNK , and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants , full - time union officials and state UNK ?    127.09253991337249
i was in sympathy with the edd group amendment , talking about rejecting the interference of the eu in the formation of governments of members states but i had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia , racism , etc . and i felt that it might be misinterpreted .    241.49270716176272
at the moment it seems that the haider party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments .    77.12286881901231
even america has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations .    91.57835958269077
what are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an intergovernmental conference ?    57.280533912431345
we attach crucial importance to applying , if necessary , the new provisions under article 7 of the amsterdam treaty so that a country which , by its actions , UNK fundamental citizens ' rights by means of discrimination and such like will have its voting rights in the eu ' s council of ministers removed .    123.00947130390647
it is our responsibility as a parliament , particularly as the democratically elected voice of the european union , to comment on current political developments in austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament .    41.83874851798831
the policy of cut - backs which has followed in the wake of UNK to emu has promoted the successes of right - wing extremism .    69.85191520440027
a radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in europe .    72.46991552678544
jörg haider ' s rise to power , with the inauguration of a conservative right - wing and fpö coalition government , is a sign of the terrible revival in europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth .    240.1964919456383
the resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of fascism .    191.90692892420736
i consider the casting of jörg haider as " europe ' s UNK " ( or even worse , neo - nazi and super racist ) to be counterproductive .    117.28998582858378
it turned its threatened loss of power into an " heroic battle for the preservation of values " and an imminent , pure - and - simple " decision between democracy and non - democracy " .    198.80836024934825
we german christian democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly UNK ourselves from them .    102.95997653528414
thank you , mr davies .    9.473699006481016
thank you , mr UNK .    2.878512271939912
this is why , madam president , i should like to see mr prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words , so that nobody , absolutely nobody , can use this message , which is unusual and unwise , to say the least , to contribute , and that includes counter to the intentions of mr prodi , towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in austria a commonplace .    143.5757268652543
i was promised back in september that there would be a dutch channel by january .    53.225068886148115
i have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and i believe that mrs banotti has an answer for you .    52.20189540248907
there seem to be UNK technical problems but we are definitely working on it .    130.24598863833123
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this .    6.274870478621664
it is inconceivable that the european parliament , which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights , should fail to adopt a clear stance on this .    55.61325044535671
we are in favour of the international criminal court , but it does not yet exist .    13.756839386993526
we believe that justice should be done in this case , but this is not the most appropriate procedure .    25.808876245874984
we consider the matter to be important enough for the commission to react swiftly to this situation , and i think that parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject .    32.48736057219894
madam president , with apologies to my friend , UNK barón crespo , i should like to speak against this proposal .    16.95418525993492
i think that your proposal , madam president , to keep the debate and the vote separate , with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date , is a reasonable one .    44.74216897239285
we already have a directive .    10.373295929982339
i understand that there is no argument about the fact that the council declaration , on the next sitting of the united nations commission on human rights , is not going to include the declaration on the UNK anniversary of the geneva conventions , and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part - session in march , so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way .    73.06478552846576
. ( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioners and members of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i was given the task of drawing up the european parliament ' s report on the community initiative programme interreg iii .    10.248014886056158
the first principle means creating a new ' pact ' between farmers and society , making the farmer ' UNK of the countryside ' and ensuring that society is prepared to pay for the environmental services needed to safeguard the countryside ' s UNK value .    151.76961518783003
leader + differs from the previous stages in that all rural areas will be eligible . it is also more ambitious , and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet .    96.0585037673432
everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin .    65.0082034521478
madam president , it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new urban community initiative and it is an achievement that i am here tonight because air france cancelled my flight at 2 . 10 p . m . but i am here !    86.91659570469753
the work of this urban agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous british pubs .    131.15088299761553
we need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the UNK skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .    87.17606369416323
our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole UNK of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning , action to prevent juvenile delinquency , the reintegration of offenders , and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved , for example the police , the courts and social services .    137.17152066613122
we believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3 , financed by leader , with those of other actions financed by other community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership , such as interreg , UNK , phare , tacis and meda , in the same areas .    93.23014771845506
the reports are late , and , in addition , they were very hastily discussed by the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism .    18.49156429133418
i would like to mention here again the urban report , in which the rapporteur , in the explanatory statements , has dealt UNK with the issue of the minimum sum of eur 500 per inhabitant as per the commission ' s guidelines .    75.09949926499982
the practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be UNK .    67.7222197955512
mr president , a third of eu money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes .    45.954878617287356
but UNK out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending .    50.44392561941482
the emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities , non - profit - making organisations and profit - making companies join forces .    81.97591077263074
however , problems will arise in particular from the fact that under phare , for example , funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project - related , whereas interreg funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures - related basis .    140.31880684902498
in this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under leader is very welcome .    63.29324449329081
that seems to me to be rather too long .    21.202265472299676
we must create a cross - border culture , and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation , UNK overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each member state , in each region and each municipality .    181.08060017146892
are there so many other european schemes which can boast 800 specific original experiments which were particularly successful ?    148.01104264022817
in this regard leader has established itself as an effective development initiative .    49.601709171564565
that is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here .    25.388883086966246
for a long time , probably a survival of our colonial heritage , our regions have fixed their attention on the european mainland , ignoring and even UNK their closest neighbours .    94.67723801457416
that time is now past .    47.20380440790794
i am counting on the commission , and specifically on you , commissioner , to allocate adequate resources for effective action .    40.179285678088014
mr president , our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the equal initiative so that , if you are a british UNK physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group : you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems , rather than being defined as the problem .    117.21172536825021
in this connection , i should like to thank the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the edf to the list of these funds .    12.461875243136141
in my opinion , it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the european union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas .    37.46269999421027
the urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds .    35.02325232583315
there is no change in refugee policy in austria !    53.80620853193687
granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well : there will be enough to drink for a while , but tomorrow the well will be dry again .    214.58262996130136
mr president , with the implementation of interreg iii , european cooperation policy is entering a new phase .    29.256201158221927
our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones .    130.23358948952253
some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic , more transparent , and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding .    104.43313529001337
i therefore intend to amend the guidelines in order to incorporate a specific priority into the transnational strand b : ' integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions ' , so as to cover , in what i think is an appropriate fashion the various opportunities for cooperation between these regions .    111.41151336817911
i adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the union are actually active frontiers of the union , even if , or precisely because , they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear .    153.26216191181618
according to the general regulations , however , any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a community initiative must be proposed under article 20 , and not article 23 .    111.422814878707
that therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 3 .    37.435973446221844
so on the basis of the treaty as it stands today , the equal initiative is structured in that way .    72.27856283690524
the minutes of the sittings of thursday 3 february and monday 14 february have been distributed .    32.39889749551637
( the minutes were approved )    1.990944740911211
she could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti - nuclear demonstration in glasgow .    178.83348810956286
i am optimistic and quite UNK and confident about the vote ; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on equal .    76.93277275097273
they have our full support .    3.558346187854426
this is not the first time this has happened : europe was once confronted with a similar transformation , an explosion of its markets , a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world .    51.749298732365396
some countries - such as france and spain - managed to meet the challenge , giving rise to great nation states ; other countries - such as italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium : headway in science , technology , economic progress , defence structures and military organisation , philosophy and literature .    207.37414325038517
we therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind , and all the institutions - commission , parliament , council - will have to consider their own roles and their own policies .    77.94263005221066
when i speak about external aid , my thoughts immediately turn to the balkans . there is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground , an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems .    119.33666896051403
there are certain other key issues : relations with ukraine , relations with russia , relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly , the important question of relations with the southern mediterranean which will be a crucial point for european history , and for security and peace in europe for future generations . in this regard , we have a responsibility towards the whole of africa .    92.05159090202811
mr president of the commission , you have represented and defended the european parliament time and again over recent weeks .    63.16742024629006
if we have the UNK suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the european union , and at present we have no cause for complaint - on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case - , but if european law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement UNK , precisely because peace in the european union is founded on this law .    115.78082192294005
on the other hand , we are witnessing the birth of a political europe , which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon , and a european union at the service of the citizens .    47.94437558929957
we must not forget africa , a continent which has been UNK , not only by god , but also by europe , nor our important contribution to cooperating with development .    79.02958400236128
it means the reform of the united nations and the international financial institutions , for which europe has an enormous responsibility .    32.34357689765625
my group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a white paper next spring addressing the issue of governance .    81.89417651335778
we will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the swoboda report later this week .    84.7375270066271
the strategic paper emphasises the global role of the european union .    17.605905608344703
that is the way it should be .    8.885299123349531
i believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day - to - day ones .    88.32997091149453
the eu can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone .    91.64095493586578
madam president , reforming and UNK the institutions of the european union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process .    41.54129900800455
however , we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the european union is a vital factor in changing the eu treaties .    27.165217433569747
local politicians cannot do that , once legislation has been passed in brussels .    123.05130831836698
we need to match this vision with reality .    17.00852784271185
we must not fear globalisation , but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society .    53.51303701867251
nonetheless , i agree with you , mr president of the commission , that many more steps to strengthen the european union will be needed in the future because the european union is not strong enough either to master the huge , inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which , to put it UNK , have an ambivalent attitude towards european values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent .    71.68533657494429
we could not agree more with the latter .    6.167653374788362
the new europe should not only expand UNK , but also UNK , by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community .    91.81190020586368
tell the truth for once . you could not care less what the people of europe want .    72.770157952796
president prodi , today you have presented the commission ' s five - year programme , and it has many objectives that we endorse .    68.4867059703872
the eu must not take on a masculine persona .    29.444785304659124
it will not be us who refuse these new resources . you should ask the council .    28.36210854024887
madam president , the commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever .    34.49198516758144
there must also be savings .    16.370633470227983
the reason our timetable includes the drafting of this charter is because we are at a key point in our history . our union needs to redefine the values on which it is based , both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we UNK desire , but not under just any conditions .    125.30055668410897
they are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather , on the basis of our social model , to be able to organise globalisation .    61.7209947982501
in fact , the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions , such as the european parliament , which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy .    75.37061151308528
no , it does not !    13.760365584126726
have you done so , mr prodi ; have you even read your work programme for the year ?    60.66466208104831
the recent dioxin scare in belgium , prior to that the bse crisis in britain , and the continuing controversy over the safety of genetically - modified UNK , have all contributed to undermining consumer confidence in the safety of the food they eat .    128.13398986726443
however , i was disappointed with the nature of the proposal for the establishment of a european food authority in the recent white paper .    34.1748104667184
we also need a code of corporate conduct to make sure that companies in fact work in partnership with their workers in the management of change .    77.93257686647368
but i am also told that they were informed UNK of this decision by the committee of chairmen of groups last thursday , so they were fully aware of the decision .    86.59996570646746
however , we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 , because they seem to us to be legally incorrect .    62.56935840687614
basically , we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but , since the vote only concerns how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used , we have confined ourselves to assessing the contents and think , in general , that the proposal for regenerating neighbourhoods in crisis contains some sensible observations , as well as some good suggestions and criteria for the relevant projects .    58.44485891306428
this is why the european parliament successfully called for the urban community initiative or cip to be extended during the reform of the structural funds .    41.17185821301766
the answer is quite simply because the projects currently being submitted are still too often damaging to the environment due to the way they are submitted .    74.66238240738917
the european commission should therefore be able to participate in the construction of port and airport infrastructure to provide links between regions .    33.193703574240295
it should not be about greater integration of the eu countries in the form of a federation but about using our economic potential across national borders .    51.79676592169264
in spite of the fact that this community initiative is aimed at rural development , it does not address the issues of agriculture and agricultural production in a consistent way , and this is unacceptable .    45.76826644644474
for our part , we will tell the farmers about the expediency of these programmes .    19.945448043049325
i can hardly wait , commissioner byrne , to hear what you have to say to our proposals .    18.219938256784427
when we talk of transparency in the food chain , that applies from the UNK to the table UNK and consumer protection therefore logically starts with feedingstuffs .    88.21610375354393
consequently , we must cut off the supply of the original source of danger , i . e . harmful additives in feedingstuffs .    59.7649693164515
otherwise , in my view , we are UNK away at the symptoms , but not the causes .    57.214882469447744
secondly , it makes sense to issue provisions for genetically - modified feedingstuff additives similar to the regulations in seed marketing legislation , as the rapporteur has said .    62.4481179094687
consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .    62.42895275328239
yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected belgium and other european countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition .    84.96460384871273
this is why it is essential to approve amendment no 2 to recital 4 which UNK the risks of the monopoly which would arise if companies which were the first to be authorised to place an additive on the market were to remain the only ones able to continue marketing it during the re - evaluation procedure .    109.32937975480785
mr president , may i commence by congratulating the rapporteur , mr graefe zu baringdorf , on his report .    4.998887028457936
i am particularly pleased that my own country , ireland , is to the forefront in the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of traceability .    69.15858708000083
a coherent legal framework must be re - established .    25.407918864860154
i am sure that the commission can accept the report which , as you know , was approved unanimously in the committee on agriculture and rural development .    9.993246198778916
mr president , i would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report .    2.2366556094488446
gmos are the new challenge facing us .    21.087801378689054
the commission proposal is , as some of you have said , rather technical .    19.173863810595172
the scope of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited .    28.416418075825923
i should also stress that the commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for gmos to be included in additives .    67.16560176132008
i look forward to the next round .    7.989336594681105
the best way of dealing with this issue is through the draft legislation before parliament at the moment , as well as the legislation in the pipeline , rather than in this technical document and in circumstances where the questions that are set out and to be debated in directive 90 / 220 may not be fully taken into account .    46.34416880244946
all of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .    28.086488083151853
many of us here in this house have spent years , whether we intended to or not , dealing solely with the consequences of the bse scandal right down to the last detail .    116.03417466580237
the cast is always the same .    24.09165578989878
at first we were somewhat UNK and we regret that now .    56.76306772800876
that is , without doubt , too short , too UNK and too little .    37.08934875233323
they belong in the legislative text . i might do the same if i were a commissioner , because i could simply change an annex under a comitology procedure and i would not always need to work with parliament , which takes so long and is so difficult .    164.88575589380352
we should not allow food safety to be compromised because , in the final analysis , it is our health which is at stake .    29.651257202245677
i am in favour of preventive measures , starting with feeding which is suitable for the species , rather than measures to combat an epidemic once it has broken out .    126.06033134196511
it is extremely important both for the producer and the consumer that we restore confidence and the only way we can do it is by rigorously tackling the problem and resolving it .    121.7136784429999
we have to ensure that the whole system of traceability , of following the animal from birth until slaughter and right through the whole food chain , is part of that confidence - building mechanism .    92.4543541836078
finally , i would say this in relation to the observation about including legislation in annexes and the observation that we must achieve an effective balance between parliament having a full say and yet at the same time our having speedy resolutions , speedy legislation and speedy amendments to existing legislation .    105.95548047897202
furthermore , europe has signed international conventions , in particular the ospar convention in which it made certain commitments .    86.94159962706995
yet we do not have much time .    6.50424119008248
some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the european parliament ' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the council of ministers .    68.09866118416366
we have therefore always argued for a progressive system of recuperation of costs . this system should take good account of social , environmental and economic effects , and its implementation should be UNK in accordance with differing geographical and climatic conditions .    105.91226408767285
this brings home the connections which bind us together .    46.73056239586164
it is a retrograde step .    14.813487107500137
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , as long as nearly thirty years ago , the european commission made attempts to draw up a european water policy .    23.471377933428073
i would like to mention two substances from the commission ' s list : mercury and UNK , UNK to tbt .    72.55943676852824
a sound alternative would be to clean the ship ' s sides UNK .    109.22724760091758
secondly , i should like the phasing out of UNK materials to be carried out consistently .    69.99576073145437
in the eu , this is a crucial issue in the mediterranean region and also in other european countries where we are witnessing the gradual UNK of wet areas .    66.20906089075015
the committee on the environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close - to - zero is , in my view , to be welcomed and worthy of UNK .    44.87226448151371
it is not an easy topic and , in my opinion , the efforts made by mrs lienemann are very laudable indeed .    34.88595997856401
the netherlands is significantly affected by the european water policy .    24.357365791198305
another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality .    20.280904898701532
in a number of amendments , the proposed standards and especially the ospar standard for 2020 are called into question .    37.413921115272906
amendment no 43 seeks to ensure that by the year 2010 water pricing policies in europe must provide adequate incentives to use water efficiently .    152.57457052472859
it would be to send out the wrong signals both to european industry and to the european people .    28.22009894847203
need i remind you that the european parliament itself took the initiative on 1 february ? i must again thank mr napolitano for organising an initial working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments who are , of course , the representatives of the people in each member state .    72.77394577615132
moreover , this initiative is consistent with recommendations made by parliament itself in its resolution of 18 november .    44.81925581285939
i have also heard commissioner barnier ' s clarification of relations and links with the european parliament during the implementation of this programme .    55.589232196129494
my personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the austrian people , businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in austria of a new government coalition .    142.0329856201448
are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion , unpopular opinions or UNK from the dominant european thinking ?    168.73311944859924
this is my first additional question .    20.631480411578398
the difficult part , which will fall to the convention , is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the treaties .    78.62765428188784
the essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the european institutions , as contained in the european project enshrined in the treaties of the european union .    37.18801008158427
the protection of ethnic minorities and of minorities that speak a specific language is an element of the programme and of the two directives that the commission has put before the council .    50.83803759611754
the environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances ( lead , cadmium , mercury , hexavalent UNK , pvc and UNK flame UNK ) .    204.10295604389364
however , i do want to listen to all the points of view .    21.98744668408361
currently , women hold 24 . 5 per cent of our a - grade posts , and we hope the number will increase steadily .    110.97890830367513
the commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field .    25.987063960334112
how can the commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the structural funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area ?    62.771042744235714
is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence , and also the authority which basically takes the money from the eu and gives it to a company that it owns 100 % ?    163.47639878925148
the operation of the community support framework is ruled by a centralising hand and indeed at this time we are experiencing state , government and party UNK as regards the european union ' s funding .    54.22803145879591
i cannot do other than work with the greek government .    19.18215964876148
question no 45 by ( h - 0041 / 00 ) :    7.697949224191701
the structural funds contribution which has enabled greater UNK of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the transport and energy department .    210.63882086851686
this led to an agreement being signed whereby the uk government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that eu spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional .    129.49212481324335
could the commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the uk government ?    54.09048785346344
it should be of comfort to the commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time , since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again .    103.85211433096642
this is a UNK debate which i realise is not totally community - related .    44.41795998093381
and any remaining UNK , i intend to leave them in the UNK .    46.50919644630542
such a rule is only normal .    25.782512221028234
this may , of course , be seen as an issue concerning the internal market , but also as a public health matter for the whole eu .    26.015584858788085
i gather that mr posselt has hinted at the fiscal aspects of this matter .    67.18842005676821
the commission has to take a decision on whether the matter is closed or whether it should refer it to the european court of justice .    26.97770899323561
we need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products .    41.06705203870299
the next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the community action in the field of water policy .    5.57174389900636
that is a matter which affects my colleagues from spain , ireland and the united kingdom .    22.298138860191223
finally , as regards the council ' s allegation , which the commission echoes , that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein , this is UNK .    109.54134560972545
the second reading of the framework directive on the issue of water is most timely ; the shocking news of the environmental catastrophe in romania must feature in today ' s discussions and also more generally when we UNK the environmental dimension of union enlargement .    75.62996093787048
i think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the european union , which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources , and i congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view .    30.15445604097634
however , we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water , granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers .    76.23978287243935
in the same way , this damage and these tragedies which are happening , as in romania , are not the problem of the legislative , but of the executive and of the governments .    71.20126274608201
all legislation must be enforceable and be based on the general principle of political acceptance .    102.13322278364348
are we talking about the distribution and UNK of water ?    21.935204865396834
we cannot be accused of bad management .    34.3240722175062
water is also one of the issues to which i shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office .    55.12239527179657
allow me also to say to mr bowe that , in common with my scottish colleague , he need have no UNK of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of scotch whisky now and again .    78.87046212221168
i would point out in this regard that the ospar convention does not in any way alter existing community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector .    51.68607072558031
the following amendments cannot be approved : 1 , 4 , 9 , 11 , 13 , 15 , 19 , 23 , 39 , 40 , 51 , 59 , 61 , 64 , 66 , 70 , 71 , 71 , 72 , 74 , 77 , 79 , 81 , 83 , 87 , 89 , 90 , 91 , 95 , 97 , 98 , 100 , 101 , 103 , 106 and 107 .    26.171777701335767
we meet our deadlines and afterwards we are told that we should hold on and that in order to be reasonable we must go along with the position of the others , because in the codecision procedure there is just not enough time .    118.81815169654847
this is one of the aims that life - environment must achieve . thirdly , the fact that the common position has for the first time introduced upgrading and planning for coastal areas as one of life - environment ' s priorities is an extremely positive step .    90.22811259213347
that explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions , ambitions for which , of course , there is a price .    42.03327216059169
the common position stipulates a total appropriation of eur 613 million for the period 2000 - 2004 . this is not enough .    15.303180493121763
we therefore support mrs lienemann ' s amendment which observes that the allocation for life was not increased when the union was last enlarged , without even mentioning the next UNK of new UNK .    93.21610739804741
more than one third of the 8 , 500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to UNK approximately 1 , 300 projects between 1992 and 1998 .    78.92931241730933
now the financial statement shows only eur 613 million to cover more countries and competences .    57.56750310422619
but creating parks with very limited financial resources , without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual .    95.69642688952942
with regard to amendments nos 5 and 6 , i want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water , together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect , are to a large degree covered by life .    89.37584888532794
but the reverse is also the case : a well - developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth .    148.32282382860282
clear guidelines and indicators are required . at the same time , the member states are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans .    58.5949898382135
as far as this is concerned , the report , albeit a component , may well be the key component of lisbon , because it is really innovative , while many other things are merely a UNK of what has been said before .    53.70915891483398
these are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them . having a group of high - ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from .    129.0211575642675
the discrepancies between the member states are too immense in terms of provisions , rightful UNK , revenue or benefits , etc . it is thus impossible to bring all states into line .    93.39084172085347
it has the advantage of clarity , and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and UNK tune solid , UNK indicators and put forward recommendations .    167.5877221614317
that is not what we want to do in europe .    7.1186095882189475
the simple reason for this was that social costs in the netherlands were just too high in comparison .    99.61437329980357
this would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this house by showing how remote we are from the real world .    88.7370974787296
the european union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of europe .    20.13882234193415
the european union should proclaim one general principle , to wit , that the social rights acquired in member states may not be restricted .    54.7557079657764
budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability .    102.50359716725619
bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income , i believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the european union .    50.84148129234816
i believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection .    42.38052729136282
UNK are big business .    14.370574887730008
the problem affects a lot of jobs in the UNK industry .    29.631864964814966
there exists a special clause which requires parliament ' s assent in two cases .    126.63554249415566
parliament must therefore give its assent , because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence .    36.51359312866545
in the united states the wipo treaty has already entered into force , having been UNK into law by means of the digital millennium corporate act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the treaty by means of this legislation .    114.6999820694363
the recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in europe , on the contrary .    83.31795927905183
if the french government insists that we continue to meet in strasbourg , it could at least ensure , where flights are diverted to basle , that buses arrive on time to meet the diverted UNK , otherwise it is quite pointless for us to try to arrive here on monday and attend to any kind of business .    170.52546496748994
mr president , i was UNK on the same flight and i am rather embarrassed to admit that the airline was UNK , our national airline company .    138.8706902449801
mr president , i just want to say that , as i was walking in this morning , i noticed two people smoking outside the hemicycle .    39.42128160219797
the subject of the statement that i have the honour of presenting to you today , is the coherence of different union policies with development policy .    20.579496983181723
as you will know , the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50 % by UNK , by increasing compulsory schooling , by significantly reducing child mortality rates , and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective .    95.3250222267657
it is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the member states ' national policies , which are not always complementary or well coordinated . a great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the european union and its member states is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual member states and the proposals and actions of the european institutions .    100.45354528140159
the third aspect that needs to be considered is european union policy and member states ' policy .    49.830004513791025
coherence of policies at european level certainly means better coordination of member states ' policies with the european union ' s development policy .    32.64037636561046
as you know , there is a UNK difference between the status of development policies and other eu policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the edf ' s financing , or rather lack of financing .    72.90218169081335
the views of the european parliament on this issue too , will certainly be both timely and welcome .    36.31504663399067
we explicitly address corruption ; we establish a framework for dealing with the problem of immigration for the first time ever .    112.10596108057236
the new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership , a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active community support .    108.08253201065106
the agreement concluded with the acp countries paves the way for new initiatives , in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the eu , and measures facilitating their integration .    98.714361249014
such a commitment entails an in - depth reform of procedures and implementation UNK on both sides .    40.385624513526935
it is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way , which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework , that is , the council and parliament .    60.61828035105661
we should not make reality out to be more rose - UNK than it really is .    47.64166201839768
i would therefore urge the council ' s presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and , above all , to conclude it in such a way that we all of us , including the people of europe , realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide .    66.76932122523603
one of the major conclusions of this report concerned the european policy ' s internal conflict .    69.12884059427687
and we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various community policies , in this case development policy .    24.46388600655753
take the fishing agreements , where we recognise the unsustainability of current fishing practices within the eu waters .    178.96810888939078
as mr nielson said this morning with regard to lomé , preferential access is only for " essentially all the products of the least - developed countries " .    58.312369638424904
i welcome mr UNK ' statement this morning , which acknowledged the difficulties of non - UNK of the edf , which called for a more active role for the development council and which called for development priorities to be central to the eu ' s emerging common foreign and security policy .    58.40392647441813
food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests .    108.76634211219691
the latter include trade , agricultural and fisheries policies .    42.12302550057744
we also have to practise what we preach in our own UNK for imports from these countries . parliament ' s resolution on the wto negotiations advocated a free import policy by the eu .    112.77193590475255
there is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the member states and there are some projects being carried out by the member states and the european union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another .    35.2395541186852
this suggests that something must be done , failing which tensions will be aggravated and conflicts jeopardising international peace and stability will arise or UNK .    80.44265128439068
much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every member state , as has been very honestly said here in this house : people more or less identify with their spheres of interest , and all this is legitimate .    127.79584708632315
for the first time , the european union tabled a resolution on the death penalty , which was enormously successful , and led work on a resolution concerning children ' s rights , which was a joint initiative with the latin american group of countries .    58.97969069638961
the united states of america will be tabling a draft resolution on china at the 56th session of the human rights commission and are putting pressure on the european union to support this draft resolution .    23.301604745777098
it is in the interests of the european union to keep all its options open for as long as possible , and in any case at least until after the eu - china human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 february 2000 .    51.8191608008542
the next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 february in lisbon , and will include seminars on legal issues and on women ' s rights , and it is expected that representatives from the UNK world and from civil society will take part .    92.28004208589257
it was decided that the dialogue should continue , but in a more targeted and effective way , given that china has agreed with the european union ' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars .    135.90261445976236
lastly , during the next human rights commission there will also be a debate on UNK the work of the commission itself .    20.876160921669623
that does not suggest any lack of commitment to the improvement of human rights but it does indicate the usual concern to get our approach right so that we really make a difference .    124.98712294351509
( the sitting was suspended at 11 . 50 a . m . for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by mr vaclav havel , president of the czech republic and resumed at 12 . 50 p . m . )    24.913913471203355
however , in order to give this new approach some chance of success , the commission should have opted for a less complicated proposal , a more simple and direct one , involving the ngos from the outset , so that partnerships could develop in a balanced way .    143.16830396897876
guidelines of the directive : a ) each city shall provide the means , in terms of energy and technology , sufficient for this objective to be achieved by 2012 ; b ) the full costs shall be passed on to the inhabitants of each city by means of electricity prices .    134.92445892533428
( end of fiction ) .    41.55589753144254
a technical working party made up of council and parliament representatives met in january 1999 to try and reconcile the positions of the two institutions .    113.68908259284109
there is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur .    60.92606185290591
we believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near UNK standard .    94.92823470514338
such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross - border areas and in candidate countries , thereby complicating enlargement .    86.15053875102946
) mr president , i voted for the council ' s strategy for modernising social protection because , in my view , it constitutes a step towards the establishment of european social and pensions legislation , although it does not actually go the whole way .    39.175378902379315
i hope that parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions .    26.391997325052834
in these areas , europe ' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .    82.90995764419297
equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our liberal agenda .    144.48417470491788
another clear UNK in this area is the fact that the european union itself is not a signatory to the convention for the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms , with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails .    40.09048414707062
mr president , in a world such as this , which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation , and not only in the economic field , our responses , in order to be effective , must be concerted and coordinated .    92.17143005557013
we must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the UNK or abuses are being punished .    56.25092414328455
it is nothing less than hypocritical to condemn the flagrant violation of human rights that occurs in non - eu countries if we are not prepared to extend a helping hand to those genuine refugees and asylum - seekers , whose position is now becoming more difficult in the eu .    91.1075015866545
they see us killing each other .    19.4077769420724
no human rights for the enemies of human rights is what the UNK of the new world order are saying today , the new world order which reigns almost UNK in financial circles , in international institutions , in the media and cultural networks , and in educational institutions , to mention but a few .    130.74705445478696
canada has invited the UNK for peace talks .    161.25468351684916
sometimes the more we speak , the less we hear - motions : words ; conventions : words ; treaties : words - if we are not careful , words themselves become a substitute for real action .    69.69368663184736
try telling that to the governments of the united states , russia and china .    114.51050646017865
my second country - i will be brief as mr patten knows this country very well - is burma .    93.78413322412361
it is vital that when violations are committed , the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity , whoever or wherever they may be - in indonesia or angola , in cuba , china or burma , whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers , humble foot - soldier or general or even a minister .    139.48927968196278
i think she was reflecting the views of many non - governmental organisations , many people who admire chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in china today .    71.37452468611376
it is immensely important , and if i had not thought that already , having listened to the remarkable speech by mr havel earlier in the day i would have certainly come to that conclusion .    158.8254442890637
there is a possibility , which has not yet been absolutely confirmed , that continuous and direct discussions may take place , with work continuing until september this year .    60.38118458621694
this window of opportunity involves combining various factors , one of which - and let us be frank about this - is the nature of the relationship between turkey and the european union .    62.462925258745955
we will make the community institutions aware of what we are able to do , and what is possible in general , as regards coordination , not just at political level but also as regards what the commission itself can achieve in terms of its scope for managing the accession process .    96.67832635464725
that government has proposed a way in which the turkish cypriot side can take part , and i think it would be right for the council and the commission to urge the turkish cypriot side to take part UNK in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the republic of cyprus .    76.4240934248589
since 4 july 1990 , when cyprus applied to join the eu , the european parliament has passed numerous resolutions calling for a political solution in accordance with international law and the relevant resolutions of the security council of the united nations .    65.34387944102282
mr president , the reference to dialogue between the two cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNK reminds us of the fact that , 26 years after the UNK of the island by the turkish army , nearly 40 % of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers , heavy UNK is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present , in total violation of the resolutions by the security council of the united nations on this matter .    90.96771504705879
i have listened to the somewhat UNK talk and UNK on the part of the council which , in my view , need clarifying .    42.0192800999769
from this point of view , the other decision taken at helsinki , namely to grant turkey candidate status , gives the fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with ankara can and , in my view , should , include a determination to ensure that turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united cyprus and peace in the eastern mediterranean .    126.46111220192951
rather , the way in which these aid measures have been UNK together smacks of UNK to me .    59.73862097947466
both the commission and the council have been making very optimistic speeches here today as well .    20.561155661793638
i am delighted that we are all heading in the same direction in this respect .    15.532944038695545
i am certain , therefore , that an island such as malta , with its population of UNK 000 cannot accommodate the UNK of the economic and legal structures of the mainland which has a population a thousand times greater .    145.71959635503637
hitherto this has been out of the question of course .    19.55927164896371
it is very far from being that simple , rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts , during talks with both communities , to encourage them to reach an understanding .    70.12638266220516
i cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place , because i lack the legal basis for doing so .    95.89846213128527
question no 1 by ( h - 0022 / 00 ) :    8.562322662719371
it emphasised the importance of the council taking new measures within a community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations .    64.8596438393379
there is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject .    26.45899266577624
even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped .    150.27659767527797
all information received during the past six months , either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of nato ' s actions during the kosovo conflict , have been recorded by the prosecutor .    150.49239748613013
any other information will of course be analysed by the prosecutor , who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action .    74.79939316244857
so we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets .    43.5306490721278
this is generally recognised and this happens in all wars , and the kosovo war was not a clean war , nor a model war , but a war based on the art of the possible .    174.55253997656882
nevertheless , i am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when , ultimately , there is in fact a major tripartite relationship .    79.07043553479444
some of these actions might have been questionable , and some were regarded as unfortunate by nato itself , but others were justified for tactical reasons , with the aim of preventing mr milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former yugoslavia .    112.58363476832251
will it set out established social rights in the european union or will it set a broader agenda ?    3.8977329031714474
as a supplementary question , i should like to ask you whether , as the portuguese presidency , you have made provision for the rights of children , as such , to be included in future deliberations and the rights to be incorporated in the charter .    39.077247053330076
mr rübig , as president - in - office , i cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the portuguese prime minister on behalf of the fourteen heads of state and government of the member states of the european union was adopted UNK and not by him in his capacity as president - in - office of the council of the european union .    20.35282068156968
the need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the british government that it is ' minded to grant ' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the ilisu dam in turkey .    78.69888906430208
what kind of measures does the council plan to take in order to strengthen the review and evaluation powers of the european institutions in similar cases ?    94.446550187717
secondly , as there is no mention of structural funds in the current draft could you ensure that this would be put back in ?    64.60798350743131
it is therefore the commission that must ensure that certain development projects comply with relevant environmental provisions .    57.08069108645847
we are therefore in perfect and total agreement in our concern to achieve a positive outcome on this matter .    34.76344727938753
( the sitting was suspended at 7 . 05 p . m . and resumed at 9 . 00 p . m . )    2.8235701517538034
( applause )    2.132414163298863
this is not your first visit to our parliament , mr president .    16.9203551500192
a communist regime sentenced you to five years in prison for defending human freedom and dignity .    52.50488144803359
the resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights .    63.11129664029795
in future , the eu must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and , furthermore , must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively .    92.09270736054174
thank you , mr UNK : if i am informed correctly , this is the first time you are addressing this house .    42.771776441946
they also had strong repercussions in the developing countries .    17.70192744170644
enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic , economic , social or religious factors , i . e . have a preventive effect .    166.61321000208386
non - least - developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements .    129.6995930733999
in this speech , i will confine myself to addressing certain points i consider fundamental .    61.17724621128359
it is my impression that this mission from the european parliament was the final push which convinced our cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the european union .    81.08146354282728
secondly , we must bear in mind that cuba ' s application has the support of all the acp countries .    12.269182943336657
if the european union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates , we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them .    118.10363302832869
in view of this positive action , there is every advantage to be gained from according the joint assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work .    72.68374372118845
poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the joint assembly and its eradication is the priority for the european union ' s development policy .    32.71060870811799
in a wider context , the priorities , as i see it , are to UNK poor countries ' debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development , as well as control of fraud and corruption .    58.61611229606013
we need to make progress with concrete and consistent action .    27.092372451871775
i am also delighted to be able to confirm that i shall be participating in the joint assembly ' s next meeting , which takes place in march in nigeria .    45.067958966300665
with regard to the UNK d ' UNK , i can inform you that the whole of the eur 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities .    73.20167583965575
it sees , in the whole UNK of aid instruments , a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards europe but that this train will continue through europe while leaving fyrom on a UNK .    131.1370900920751
mr president , the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the greek UNK surrounding it .    50.77004059278569
with this in mind , we have presented some amendments which i hope parliament will accept .    37.21055598176857
since then , expectations have been high .    27.208275343870916
this is not the union ' s only contribution .    19.975067089939852
so we must admit that developments in macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines .    63.91361444785205
but the country also - and especially - needs external stability .    56.51484260089215
you should know that the country which cooperates most with fyrom and has the best relations with it , in the entire area , is greece , and this has contributed greatly to the stability of the area .    54.21806761660194
they cover the inclusion in the agreement of arrangements establishing a political dialogue with fyrom .    84.49756901459145
i am due to visit fyrom in the second week in march .    66.99425745076904
i hope that the other countries of the region will UNK their efforts to make similar progress .    32.750432524611455
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0021 / 2000 ) by mrs frassoni , on behalf of the committee on constitutional affairs , on the agreement between the european parliament and the commission on the implementation of the new council decision of 28 june 1999 on comitology ( 1999 / 468 / ec ) .    5.101403907041476
during the protracted interinstitutional negotiations - which saw parliament actively involved , thanks to the work of the rapporteur , UNK UNK - it was understood that the european parliament and commission would conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the procedures for implementing certain aspects of the new decision . on the one hand , certain points which the council did not intend to incorporate into the decision were to be made explicit and , on the other , the system for providing information about implementing measures and monitoring them was to be organised more precisely .    106.44668375742621
but we all realise that it is not always possible to wait a month before implementing a measure .    53.13303239772688
for the european parliament , the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed , at least , of all that the european commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees .    66.53665120789108
in my view , instead of " UNK werden müssen " the wording should be " UNK UNK müssen " .    94.30040015146325
for the rest , i warmly thank our rapporteur .    12.16135704227961
both branches adopt the legislation - council and parliament - that confers implementing powers on the commission .    65.3196312235056
we shall have to be very vigilant on what used to be covered by that agreement and is not fully covered by the new decision .    69.09083015541393
so how far have we come ?    45.309283307769896
in addition to incorporating a new methodology , this has meant making slight changes to most accounting aggregates and operations , on account of the aforesaid methodological changes , and also the improved statistical information included in the estimates .    130.92524903467938
the stability pact is in place and we will continue to press ahead with monitoring compliance by the various member states , despite the fact that the results are clearly positive in all the member states where we have analysed the position as regards the stability of the government deficit .    80.48263879194572
it is easy to forget that it will be possible to exchange the old currencies for twenty years after the new currency has been introduced .    38.8324829997396
it is doing a number of things that are right , as mrs cederschiöld has described ; but , in the context of these things she described , parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision , not so much at the report drawn up by mrs cederschiöld , but more at the procedures that are being applied .    53.54984706503828
the fact is people are suddenly going to lose all their currency references , and that means they will be at serious risk of easily accepting forged euros because they are not very familiar with the genuine article .    157.03718786247092
i would also like to make a more general point .    12.237815592874705
just a few little technical reports like this one on counterfeiting .    46.10713488228901
there are a number of questions of principle which are demanding solutions , because the point of departure is , of course , that the regulation of criminal law is a national concern .    35.87866116475038
we need to define the precise responsibilities of the ecb , the national central banks , the commission and europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro .    93.30616862038038
i certainly appreciate that .    11.482911779765889
i should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises ; the president and the bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue ; the commission , and especially the commissioner , for being such worthwhile contacts ; the council ; and also the division responsible for UNK the committee , for its UNK work .    112.35150975042515
special risk - spreading rules are proposed in respect of such investments , involving both quantitative and qualitative criteria .    42.34139600226401
a crucial point is that rules are proposed for so - called simplified prospectuses .    96.82619430239565
this is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation , albeit in a prudent manner .    58.075838174317624
it would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments .    70.1948786543043
you have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash , but that would be to waste your research into the winners .    72.70622063350632
a europe that faces an UNK pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of europe can obtain on their savings .    82.18281998074997
mr schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of parliament for over - the - counter derivatives .    43.41265430626184
firstly , i am very satisfied that the proposal for a directive as a whole increases the scope of investment funds for targeting capital at different instruments .    73.03854924127711
since the average european family puts its savings in investment funds , the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and i would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk - spreading are concerned .    136.77778153670027
the commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the committee on economic and monetary affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas .    53.69863661328915
amendments nos 49 , 50 and 51 , which share the same basis , are not acceptable because they make substantial changes to the consistent approach of the commission regarding the regulations of third party delegation , and do not offer sufficient security to the competent authorities and investors .    145.16526883809883
first of all , regarding the remarks of mr crowley , who asked whether the second proposal could not simply consist in taking over a pure isd approach ; the objections of the commission to that proposal would be the following : such an approach would pose difficulties which would arise from two different authorisations which may even involve different authorities and non - consistent sets of rules ; moreover there would be no provisions whatsoever on conflicts of interest .    147.99424660257807
it is for this reason that , despite the many omissions in the text , the provisions set out therein could - and i say could , mr president - be accepted on condition that they are suitably amended in order to ensure they can be implemented by those responsible for applying the law and are acceptable to the citizens .    78.29289853446356
the amendments can be UNK as follows : they place greater emphasis on fundamental rights of defence , introduce a range of technical modifications needed to make a whole series of obscure and inconsistent passages more comprehensible , and delete the section relating to the remote interception of telecommunications , an area which still requires not only increased technical awareness but also acceptance on the part of the governments of the various member states of the union .    124.2404623478424
the other point which i must highlight and on which we have also worked extensively is the use of video UNK with regard to accused persons .    71.27217998158658
as a result , the european parliament is faced with an almost impossible task .    22.490913897038766
the other main reason , however , is that , even though we are concerned here with a convention ( and therefore with international cooperation ) , there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal . and the trend is towards creating , in the longer term , a common european area of jurisdiction , common eu criminal law and common eu administration of justice .    87.57299481131767
the lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty .    42.847222778294636
mr di pietro ' s proposal to UNK the current article 18 regarding UNK telecommunications , amongst other things , is understandable , although very strict .    63.94589753813021
in this way , member states would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the state where interception occurs and the citizens within that state .    94.3310618889123
but the council ' s draft leaves a lot to be desired and attracts criticism on several counts .    55.43057723988967
as i have said , numerous amendments have been incorporated which guarantee the rights of the defence - i am thinking here of the obligation for interceptions to be requested by a judge - or the prohibition on holding both an investigative and a judicial mandate as part of a joint investigation team .    113.09832569905976
apart from that , the tampere european council has already indicated in which direction we , in the commission , should go .    39.55824766916294
ii . the proposal for a european parliament and council directive amending directive 85 / 611 / eec on the coordination of laws , regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities ( ucits ) with a view to regulating management companies and simplified prospectuses ( com ( 1998 ) UNK - c4 - UNK / 1998 - 1998 / UNK ( cod )    56.86560632002426
( fr ) madam president , when a UNK , a spaniard , a UNK and a german have to negotiate in english , linguistic ambiguities will arise .    89.89780799202758
correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts .    79.2457988297947
i should like you , madam president , to express to the council our wish that they be present at such votes in future .    61.12299989887604
( parliament rejected the proposal for a resolution )    2.5012679055748652
we are a group of unity in diversity .    52.92134898507386
report ( a5 - 0031 / 2000 ) by mr swoboda , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the commission recommendation on a council decision authorising the commission to negotiate a stabilisation and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia ( sec ( 1999 ) 1279 - c5 - 0166 / 1999 - 1999 / 2121 ( cos )    4.66304821589044
i hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this .    32.110085941097424
cederschiöld report ( a5 - 0020 / 2000 )    3.5097192830986024
i cannot but support the rapporteur in deploring the fact that the present national currencies from which the euro is to take over are not protected .    133.4552889677722
we are therefore voting against the report and strongly urge the UNK of the idea of harmonising criminal law on such UNK grounds . instead , the focus should be upon preventing the real problem .    76.27393997156294
. commissioner prodi pointed out that ' africa is our responsibility ' and not apparently that of the usa and other major countries .    120.44972335095541
all we find are vague phrases about ' strategic partnerships ' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of europe would apparently bring with it .    85.15721677503515
i do , of course , understand the constraints of the moment and i am prepared to entertain the idea of the risk of failure .    62.54351310330687
agriculture and health : we see the issue differently from the commission : in our view there are no consumers : there are only citizens who want to eat healthy food - products which are not designed for competitiveness but health , quality and respect for the environment .    158.9737481647462
the decision to include a clause obliging acp countries to take back illegal immigrants entering europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity .    113.87398851391798
it is incumbent on the european union and the united nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner .    44.06660755031571
especially as the vulnerable architecture of this ambitious structure has been threatened .    87.26940819249623
or on shell ?    27.704007982067772
( fr ) the commission ' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the european union and the former yugoslav republic of macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the community would appear to respond to a primary concern : a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south - east europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the second world war .    45.24781704326187
we have set minimum requirements at european level , which all member states and all companies must observe when contemplating job losses , especially when they are massive , or preparing other decisions likely to affect workers .    115.47003094192266
secondly , an immediate revision would make things much more complicated as regards progress in respect of the other pending dossiers in this field like european company statutes and the national information and consultation proposal .    139.11227293078736
but i did not hear a UNK when UNK and UNK were discussed , where , similarly , a great number of european employees were involved .    91.3647408061137
they must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations . they must revise the directive on collective redundancies , reduce the working day , link european subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the european union .    158.61704873227413
i do not think this is at all fair , either to the workers at the cisterna plant or to all those italian and european citizens whose taxes have , albeit indirectly , enabled goodyear to benefit from the state aids i have just mentioned .    87.08714003562346
that concludes the debate .    2.226837003526942
we must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of el ejido against immigrant workers in the area . a whole community should not have been held responsible , UNK and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident .    160.49901244940688
these authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these , as has happened with the mayor in question .    82.0355065636731
we must therefore ensure that the eu provides every possible resource so that the economy of the south can prosper and enable a society to develop with more tolerance and respect for one another . this has not been achieved with the solutions proposed to date which have quite simply been based on looking the other way .    112.16797948628354
working conditions are so hard and so deplorable that no spaniard will accept them .    135.6898066457072
finally , and i think this is important : why not have the honesty today to relay what was UNK in a recent un study explaining that , if spain wishes to preserve its work , retirement and pension potential , it is no good just giving 30 000 immigrants a year legal status ; it needs to be prepared to accept 12 million immigrants between now and the year UNK ?    179.9520855239508
yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments . outside the community arena , some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies .    75.90703440141537
thank you , commissioner .    2.0609940853014184
by christmas , there were perhaps 100 and , by the spring , still only a fraction of the force it had been agreed should come was , in fact , in place .    144.57263950990512
but nato ' s decision for military intervention and the kla ' s support for the armed forces had a devastating effect and have reduced kosovo to a UNK , as well as destroying civil infrastructures in serbia .    142.7122191688032
we condemn all violence over there and that is what we need to do , but we cannot talk about genocide in reverse .    48.95480176144283
the people are holding demonstrations , they are sending us e - UNK .    55.64302062479973
it is logical that the special representative of the un in kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation , especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region .    36.268855430561736
paris is leaving its fellow - countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen , not more than 37 , in the crisis region .    273.0466796017535
without national reconciliation , reconciliation with europe is not possible .    35.40131018190707
the repeated appeals made by the angolan church and , for example , by mr UNK and mr UNK , for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this house .    35.99856831938808
as another member said , we must have a general debate on angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country .    61.16049994976784
this was appropriately described a few weeks ago as the first world war of africa , given the involvement of certain countries in others .    110.09977924786017
the so - called civilised world should UNK its head in shame .    66.70794059810227
this is also the case for the so - called statutory government which is just as guilty , because if this journalist has accused the president himself of deriving benefit from this civil war , then all he is doing is UNK what the entire world knows already and which is being passed on to every tribal district across africa .    178.50986029325563
we have just approved the water directive here in parliament .    31.334039798194
the fight of these indians is being backed by more than 250 ngos and , thanks to the efforts of the belgian ' mother earth ' organisation , we are being kept informed of this situation .    102.05512799393719
citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air - UNK UNK .    72.07990455295992
despite the pledges made , violations in , for example , UNK have still not been investigated .    69.25535898104937
mr president , a journalist is on a fact - finding mission and this calls for freedom .    45.18553827330721
i beg you to intervene .    33.01839671910192
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the tragic case of the courageous russian journalist andrey babitsky illustrates once again the depth of the democratic crisis into which russia has sunk .    73.49795271481779
it is simply not possible for a country to have normal economic relations with the eu if it does not recognise democratic principles .    46.90454507505783
the facts are clear .    17.37053237218268
andrey babitsky was an unwanted UNK in mr putin ' s ' anti - terrorist ' operation in chechnya .    219.3024555353999
cambodia    288.83634784624024
the commission believes strongly that press freedom and free speech will be crucial for progress with peace and reconciliation in angola .    71.79383774940436
the commission shares the growing concern about the missing russian journalist , mr babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in chechnya more generally .    108.34711553516166
mr president , when the doñana disaster occurred , the non - governmental organisation , the world wide fund for nature , gave us a report on the number of reservoirs of this type in europe .    74.27503218904904
it also UNK light upon the low level of environmental requirements in some of the applicant states .    33.5751740416452
who is going to pay ?    25.999739647014646
i am thinking in particular of the gold mines in french UNK , where the workers , who are generally women , are exploited and work in absolutely deplorable health conditions .    98.77708460890847
. let me associate myself , not least as a former environment minister , completely and without any reservation whatsoever , with the expressions of concern by honourable members .    136.39177703096354
ultimately , it is a question of different spheres of authority , where the european parliament and its members do not have any legal means of changing the current corporate decision or do not even have a particularly deep knowledge of the situation in the factory as it stands .    59.10562661960507
( it ) mr president , ladies and gentlemen , despite the european union ' s delay and indecision with regard to the introduction of a fully - fledged community policy on tourism , increasing attention is being paid to tourism as a sector capable of generating new jobs .    45.11628079422292
social growth has occurred only in those areas where the tourist market has given rise to the development of all the activities required to meet the needs of visiting tourists , thus creating an entire productive system .    78.5275389900336
we must take very serious note of the need to upgrade the human resources engaged in tourism , so that tourism will be able to respond to the new technological challenges of our age .    87.35479603859154
mr president , i too believe that tourism has a very important role to play , not just in our european regions , but throughout the world , because it is a great asset when it comes to economic and social development .    32.06015599414974
when it comes to tourism , we can no longer do what we like where we like .    49.17738011126992
i can think of many mountain regions which are continually UNK in order to develop a tourist sector .    75.17986386139223
under no circumstances can we , as responsible politicians , allow what is currently happening to continue , with young girls practically bought in the countries of the east and coming here to be abused on the cheap .    111.72052973109143
first of all i should like to thank mr viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report .    12.337267957392795
there are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test - UNK , therefore , for integrating job creation strategies .    43.952236293952595
in our view , the UNK which could create a basis for its support are : the addition of material capital for tourism in the new review which will also constitute a legal base for the sector , the framing of a community tourism policy to support the sector without disturbing the operation of the tourism market , coordination of the tourism policy with other , parallel community policies which affect it directly or indirectly , a study of the sector , and the adoption of medium and long - term measures to enhance the competitiveness of tourism as a product .    170.66463626346936
every year , nearly 200 million europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel , usually to other countries in europe .    81.91546624261639
coordination of community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies , transport , employment , environment , culture and competition must strongly involve member states and the tourism industry itself .    156.63095766479114
it is because the key emphasis on the enterprise policy will be how to help to create new enterprises ; how to make it easier for young people and women to create their own enterprises .    105.45133979549199
are there any comments ?    2.082858426308268
the spanish vice - presidents of the european parliament were represented .    72.16167264331325
one such area is tourism which , by its very nature , is very much a national concern .    35.62318428440902
i am therefore voting against the proposal .    9.707944745449659
fortunately , the italian government and the president of the republic intervened , and today the italian ambassador to germany will also speak on the subject , to call on the german chancellor not to interfere in italian internal affairs , in so far as there are no neo - fascist candidates for government office .    73.61093720713417
that requires greater efficiency which , in turn , is dependent on competition .    91.90796589556447
the commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects .    80.5633110904453
mr markov , in five or six minutes time , you will be allowed a few minutes to speak .    55.68582159314752
there has been a deafening silence from the commission during the period between then and now .    66.35727378448928
the postal service is not just for christmas .    20.552920092808836
it is for life .    6.904970376956957
they should be able to do so without compromising their equal opportunities and equal treatment .    32.63041280721777
if revenue is lost , then public interest operations will be revised and cut , and again it is in rural areas that the most UNK cuts will be made .    124.94685607500386
as is known , the commission should already , before the end of 1998 , have tabled new proposals for a revision of the postal services directive 97 / 67 , guaranteeing the continued provision of a universal service , securing its economic viability , and regulating the gradual liberalisation of the postal services market while taking into account the consequences of this for all those involved , including postal workers and customers .    77.79969639102423
the end result will be that existing companies will also be forced into bad practices .    83.4200078235616
we should define the universal service precisely , establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender .    109.50450021087173
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , postal services , just like any european public service , contribute to the social cohesion of community territory under the terms of article 16 of the treaty of amsterdam .    35.16650323684676
these impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation , not just on the economic organisation of the market , but also in terms of its human and social aspects .    87.0433283352029
by defining a sector reserved for public postal services , on the basis of weight and price limits , the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases .    108.93740177271505
and here i want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - parliament and the commission must consider where to draw limits to competition .    92.45771653453573
yet i believe that , as this debate has shown , we have to discuss the limits to competition in some areas .    39.83426218696864
letters to strasbourg arrive there a bit sooner , but it still takes far too long .    126.03564595021692
democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office .    71.04792950291292
scotland as a country is larger than some member states .    36.936037393522575
the commission ' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the commission , of which i am sure parliament is not totally unaware .    89.95516180029692
in a sense this is where its work begins .    64.15340849548598
the policy undertaken by the european institutions and by national governments , especially the french government , is a retrograde policy , counter to the interests of both the service users , i . e . the great majority of the population , and the postal service workers .    94.30030007031542
saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate .    76.87940633938291
postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service .    73.4869620064854
however , it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints .    47.69379171909948
that should UNK compensate them for UNK their contact with the postman .    63.02799258284316
the public still regard this as being a long way off but it is very real and should serve to make us question certain aspects of our current situation .    121.81040125580984
everyone can be what they want to be because , if ireland and britain are both in the european union , there is no point in killing each other for being irish or british .    76.06173062448349
what difference does it make to be basque ? surely it is all the same thing .    18.03255141960582
we are not just confined to brussels or strasbourg .    31.921354969211183
then , last november , before the ceasefire was over , the spanish government spokesman , mr UNK , declared that his government had done and would in the future do everything possible to hinder present moves towards a political solution in the basque country .    125.9017200793044
adoption of the minutes of the previous sitting    2.52438864502551
the minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed .    4.176174518911236
we are about to discuss the subject of reforming the commission and you will recall , madam president , that at the beginning of the last session , i raised with you the question of whether , in the interests of openness and transparency , the members ' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the internet .    64.62461710205991
- ( it ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , last july , here in your presence , i made a solemn commitment to reform the commission .    29.552781017279333
one : definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources .    45.348542857797625
they are extremely highly qualified , of a UNK which it is difficult , if not impossible , to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used .    119.10194602921507
the very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five - year plan .    40.365545233213126
madam president , the commission proposals include the waiver of immunity of officials .    23.257286982105658
the second point that i want to make concerns information technology .    19.624030444311504
we will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first .    27.390985789482524
two questions if i may .    13.29585940178035
account is taken of that too in the white paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system , it most certainly can be used .    82.3521168981761
we are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering .    77.77311484105378
it has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays i am sure will be very welcome , but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork . excessive paperwork .    208.52266711354991
we UNK the excess of paper , but given the requirements that we have to check and re - check and double check in order to guarantee effective financial control , sometimes the requirements of administration , which some call bureaucracy , are unavoidable .    229.29162305523417
that concludes question time .    3.0960219565208686
statement by the high representative for common foreign and security policy    6.20744725670694
the events in kosovo and the balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds . there are also important issues at stake in the middle east in which the president of this house played a major role on her recent trip .    108.1006525032229
i will speak of this briefly . if you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time , i will be pleased to answer them .    32.55953170482318
the fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months .    42.508200912909025
to say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace .    123.20954721632349
how can we do this ?    12.631164196033115
i am not going to say much more on these issues .    8.954524603498546
i hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from commissioner gil - robles and , in particular , better news from the russian authorities .    35.19896757246877
i am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian , peace - keeping and peace - making tasks .    53.55555093191357
diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats .    587.0867300644387
this should be exercised first and foremost in the member states .    21.668370603508695
what is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment .    90.4446354026054
you are building UNK in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers .    116.07589502226617
mr poettering is right - when he is right you have to tell him so .    83.67085129389977
today , even mr cohn - bendit - and that is saying something - can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for .    88.5935815573837
it cannot be restricted to a small number of countries , with others only being allowed to observe or UNK decisions " .    72.93743601811846
fourthly and finally , if the member states asked for this , would you be prepared to chair the political and security committee ? in this way you could contribute all your experience as secretary - general of the council of ministers , high representative for common foreign and security policy , secretary - general of the western european union and a former secretary - general of nato .    41.64456610835393
mr president , allow me to start with the UNK of kosovo .    6.075071112536067
it is obvious since the nato bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing , not to promote peace and order but to drive a UNK even further into yugoslavia , to change the borders and to promote the new order .    118.5573316366391
i would also like to know whether , in this context , it would not be possible to do something to induce the iraqi government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the UNK missing UNK , or to set them free if this is within their power .    53.44253454420818
however , we note that you have said nothing to us about the fact that the role of the security council , as referred to at helsinki , was contested recently .    30.640170987466135
and a woman was elected .    21.31364696259934
the second event took place in france , which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in april 1999 at the ' women and men in power ' conference , at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio .    181.90869162659448
the number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small .    50.02594310545974
the recent initiative by the finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision - making centres is extremely important .    23.350187681568613
i think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets , compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool .    107.94938264867004
that is absolutely crucial .    8.219902497957587
it should also be remembered , however , that no one voluntarily UNK power , and that applies to both men and women .    56.47949128144585
moreover , i would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today .    31.27155839585556
inevitably , we should like , for the same reasons of power politics , to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves .    72.07122449290839
what is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined .    48.218505019682226
we do not have any such officers , but black UNK are in fact to be found .    20.278427730953325
women work an average of 60 hours a week , which is 20 hours longer than men .    162.79518160116976
finally , i would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference .    12.870797858623826
it is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the council , the commission and each member state strictly to respect the commitments they have made , particularly at the beijing conference .    75.36985039545654
i think this is a very sad state of affairs .    8.106220062695428
the second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders .    38.16165074376465
the women ' s conference in beijing brought an important point to light .    49.37776269269993
finally , on the question of whether , as the product of quotas , we can be proud , i would reply categorically that i would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that i had managed to impose quotas on greece , where the level of representation of women is 5 % .    134.45788868239396
i have received a motion for a resolution pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) .    6.812343707589119
what could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of ?    69.47656682035907
and this is happening in a country which , because it is one of the poorest in the world , does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary .    82.42269982411737
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there remains , however , one immediate problem : the need to provide help for all mozambicans who have been afflicted , many of whose lives are in danger , in their flooded villages , hoping that they will be UNK .    100.74045113775253
there is a case as the commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the UNK preparations in place .    184.18131912617875
thank you , mrs kinnock .    8.861002889877293
what are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report ?    26.057752740346295
UNK by imposing social convergence criteria and other community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs .    114.6338378867073
and europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets .    137.16904507246917
that is what the debate we are having is all about , on the subject of which i have this to say to you : we need more freedom and less state intervention .    46.534253014412876
the real world simply does not work like that .    47.49518839719131
it appears that these programmes will not cover the whole range of potential data but will be selective , for example , by type of fish stock .    84.48351771595715
the other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation .    30.29325399783663
as already stated the proposal for the council decision falls into two parts .    38.95925417732633
more significantly , under amendment no 1 , the fisheries committee accepts the recommendation of the budgets committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1 ( b ) rather than heading 3 of the financial perspective .    142.46721391276688
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6537259368439228
the second proposed change would permit a phased withdrawal of fish from affected farms , working to a plan based on the severity of the problem in any particular farm .    154.11524153512747
i also highlight the issue of compensation and call for the amendment of council decision 90 / 424 / eec by specifically including isa in its UNK list of diseases , thereby enabling compensation to be paid at 50 % commission , 50 % member state .    175.95331420952766
for the others , well , we would have time to see what would happen , according to local circumstances .    97.56019135677045
had it been at that time , you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the eu a huge amount of money .    95.97589950620197
you also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease .    30.481397464172115
i also propose to provide that the withdrawal of fish displaying clinical signs of disease should be immediate .    95.7513084817309
these panels are UNK to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention .    89.3031894094175
the overall strategy of the commission is to direct fisheries activities towards both economically and environmentally sustainable levels through management of the scarce resource in such a manner as to prevent its exhaustion through over - exploitation and / or environmental degradation .    146.63267334947002
whilst the communication reveals the commission ' s worthy intentions in this field , it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made .    213.96144216845232
that appeared in the communication published last july .    123.10512237885986
we welcome the intention of the commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the eu including the common fisheries policy .    35.998031359477245
twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back .    72.78833594429906
i am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources , and i also welcome the commission ' s request to propose the institution of a european UNK to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour , in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life .    91.21157858042652
i consider that we are experiencing an historic moment in this regard .    21.493544159337944
the commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the convention .    27.130370190102017
with regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person , this idea is clearly defined in article 3 .    64.44437303457808
the vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a . m .    1.6537259368439228
the main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature , which is nowadays too often being punished by man ' s activities .    117.78072727624502
on behalf of the pse group , i want to send a message of solidarity to those affected , to the fishermen , farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market .    57.19751337361395
parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable .    75.83110815833953
some of them have already lost several years ' worth of UNK , but the 50 % to 80 % slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the atlantic coastline , and even those in the channel and north sea .    162.90093836638673
the many fishing days lost affect the entire industry and , above all , the future of fishery products , an area in which prices had seen something of a turnaround in very recent years , now UNK entirely on consumer reaction and we are starting to see signs , unfortunately , of initial UNK .    137.52159244026112
