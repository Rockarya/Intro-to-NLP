although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly UNK , hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease .    3.0268978592957474
we report a 29 - year - old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a UNK UNK .    2.9224277565469023
establishing nursing science at german universities has become more and more consolidated .    3.554427421913783
at the beginning of this establishment there was an evident UNK especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries .    2.8016841243368575
today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at german high schools and universities .    2.8387283998679074
active glucocorticoids ( gcs ) , such as cortisol or UNK , are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung .    3.8656043328155354
in fetal serum , biologically inactive metabolites ( cortisone or 11 - UNK ) outweigh the active forms .    3.3704490700689456
in this study we demonstrate with UNK cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11 - UNK dehydrogenase ( 11 - hsd ) regulates the intracellular activation of gcs .    2.863256985709577
the inhibition of 11 - hsd by the UNK extract UNK acid completely inhibits this central metabolism .    3.566976895591504
on the other hand , gcs induce the reductive activity of 11 - hsd and , therefore , they increase their own activation by positive feedback .    2.7418729776376165
in a community sample of 394 UNK aged 61 years and older from east and west germany , diseases , contacts with general practitioners and specialists , the use of medicine , attitudes regarding health and illness , the subjective health , psychic problems , social support , social integration , social burden , and socio - demographic variables were assessed .    2.976073101854476
based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed .    2.7159316184349356
the results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly ; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person .    3.695528497312621
in nearly 10 % of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time .    3.41467103971555
88 % had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year , 97 % had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year .    3.5266197242252986
55 . 8 % took at least one medicine each day .    4.448224660399022
the number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine .    3.0593173308566195
fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful , that had low control beliefs regarding their own health , and that experienced only a low degree of health - related limitations in their everyday life .    3.344409468707901
furthermore , we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support .    3.240569061810484
there were no significant age - related or sex - related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine .    3.1924108470245254
inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd : crohn ' s disease , ulcerative colitis ) are chronic inflammatory and frequently relapsing diseases of the gut that ultimately lead to destruction of the intestinal tissue .    2.8857932558705173
recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of ibd .    3.4779625530737954
furthermore , changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of ibd and the postoperative recurrence of crohn ' s disease .    2.9078459366472065
based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of ibd , several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice , including recombinant anti - inflammatory cytokines ( ifn - , il - 10 , il - 11 ) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules ( UNK ) , proinflammatory cytokines ( tnf , il - 12 ) and their receptors ( tnf , il - UNK ) .    3.7522265447029968
dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .    2.9958526997782364
a defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response .    3.141328732457878
in addition , there are several links between c1q and sle : most the patients with c1q deficiency develop a sle - like syndrome .    2.9153130189229413
sle itself often causes secondary c1q deficiency and autoantibodies to c1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis .    3.295771852458803
these observations suggest a central role of c1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of sle .    3.615479215500796
objective : the aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving UNK and UNK in order to establish strategies for accident prevention .    3.2735596270835465
the discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and UNK and its consequences has been under way for some time now .    3.469275038869586
the rate at which telemedical applications are being developed , leaves little time for consideration of the economic , scientific and social aspects .    3.2142814382102594
there is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept .    2.8527053865764103
different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed .    3.0430475769275813
a 34 - year - old woman who was separated from her husband , was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest .    2.5248589085150037
the post - mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death .    3.4449881190331317
at the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken .    2.871193355975747
additionally , a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her UNK - neck UNK .    3.067838717585273
it was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a UNK pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim .    3.5891151949534894
dna typing ( short tandem repeat - pcr ) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect .    3.667930019228725
a prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self - reinforced absorbable UNK ( biofix ) in the fixation of ankle fractures .    4.2510165941134845
the aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard a . o . fixation .    2.5871928469120022
the benefits of biofix rods and screws are : a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed , prevention of stress - shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity .    3.3535407459143585
22 patients were treated with biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique .    4.343424516409029
after 3 , 6 and 12 months , UNK were taken .    3.9523661898870377
at the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of olerud and molander .    3.114844492214476
two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non - medical reasons .    3.3591622441889384
22 patients ( 12 from the biofix group , 10 from the ao group ) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen .    3.058293201689487
in 4 cases a biofix screw UNK down just beneath the head during insertion .    2.907273109353127
this did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture .    3.8448488218590726
there were no early post - operative complications .    3.152143598614714
the functional and UNK results in both groups were equal .    3.938764016357937
in three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion .    3.1794230186624857
biofix rods and screws , made of polylactic acid , are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle .    3.9800863641810675
the use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary .    3.1722689616492894
the long term results are good .    3.736186980311054
there is , however , a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material .    3.79395365864729
in current textbooks of dermatology , lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular , intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology .    3.187231423847685
when this concept was developed , there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid .    3.9561709339813897
it is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins , as it is in systemic amyloidoses , but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes .    2.7817622270384397
even several years ago , chronic scratching was UNK as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus .    3.365250141876697
apart from amyloid in the papillary layer , all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching ( epithelial hyperplasia with UNK and UNK UNK , UNK collagen in vertical UNK in the stratum UNK ) , such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus .    3.7163902008359
lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions .    3.8537560383052414
just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus , pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions .    2.81988735538374
consequently , treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid , but at improving the pruritus .    3.3219094825093993
ulcers in chronic venous insufficiency , especially in postthrombotic syndrome , are often resistant to compression therapy .    4.003225705693875
they can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure .    2.9659581889299056
the removal of the ulcer together with the extensive UNK by UNK knife ( shave - therapy ) and immediate grafting with a UNK split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient UNK veins - yields very good success rates .    3.5735875248748146
the results in 13 patients ( 18 legs ) with an average follow up period of 11 months ( up to 20 months ) are reported .    4.140904194614715
the literature from 1990 - 1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites .    3.1072399972664027
symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution , death due to adder bite is rare .    2.8067588070364993
the main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema , hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy , very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure .    3.02664511626536
significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2 - 3 h after the incident , no signs of intoxication can be found .    3.4390711511640455
background : the use of high - UNK communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields .    3.3052090302470982
this article surveys the possibilities for scientific data - exchange via the internet , the world ' s largest computer network .    2.9672318661034986
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssri ) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants .    3.203109604673859
in two cases an increase in qtc time was observed , severe bradycardia was also observed twice .    3.6474849173237787
objective : cultural detection of UNK UNK is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough , since culture takes three to five days until results are available , and only about 30 - 60 % of patients may be detected by this method .    4.174005610816305
in order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough , different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) were developed .    2.6106870355281964
with the introduction of each new technique for UNK eye movements , the question arises concerning whether these provide a reliable and accurate alternative for the diagnosis of labyrinthine dysfunction when compared to the most commonly used electro - UNK technique .    3.8623992906593774
to answer this question we compared mean slow - phase velocity ( spv ) using three different recording techniques : electro - oculography ( eog ) , video - oculography ( vog ) and infra - red oculography ( irog ) during four different types of examinations .    2.7775547892431014
the examinations were the eye target tracking test ( ett ) , horizontal and vertical UNK nystagmus ( okn ) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal UNK - ocular reflex ( UNK ) .    2.823015701226068
for the ett tests the vog provided consistently higher mean spv values with low variance , presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration .    3.3455976569394603
for the horizontal okn and UNK rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean spv obtained with the different recording techniques , although the irog recordings were associated with a larger variance .    3.460497545633795
vertical okn mean spv was consistently lower with irog and vog techniques presumably because of non - UNK and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques .    3.4529231640083538
these results indicate that the eog technique despite its disadvantages of noise , time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive , reliable and accurate means of measuring slow - phase eye movements .    2.8218842114633147
aim : the aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules UNK - 1 and se - selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity .    2.841838597871901
problem : the data model given in the dicom standard is examined UNK the aspect of system integration .    3.1314969029990185
UNK properties of the UNK ( information object definitions ) and their relationships are investigated .    4.2996692547951785
thoracic disc herniation is rare .    3.1363375934835727
pain is the most common initial symptom , followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement .    3.585910753139689
by the time of diagnosis , 90 % of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression .    4.356243697096304
a 42 - year - old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain .    3.0724931652542145
during her stay in hospital , the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after UNK an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the t10 / 11 disc .    3.3884623259988427
degenerative changes have been considered to be a cause for spontaneous quadriceps tendon rupture .    3.729596419600201
aim of this study is to investigate the UNK of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods ( antibodies against laminin ) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration .    4.0580747840505955
the blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery , by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries .    3.266529839838103
blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network .    2.484609840674433
compared to the surrounding synovial layer , the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced .    3.4143518972356506
the distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous .    3.05348853618519
the anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the UNK - UNK junction to the patella .    4.093569912301013
within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app .    3.2573875860608856
30 mm in length and app .    3.382572094756481
within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative .    2.857219631044202
an explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as UNK for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed .    3.6156693945884344
the occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region .    3.454719412691796
when looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration ( bec ) in artificially respirated patients , consideration must be given to the UNK and temperature of the gas examined .    3.5424839073973518
in the present study , the effects of UNK and warmed and of dry and cold air on the accuracy of a newly developed bec measuring device , as compared to a reference model and to a conventional system , were examined in a lung model .    3.6219985634978573
total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following le fort i osteotomy in clp patients are frequent and major complications .    2.997409498991079
the aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement .    3.1016344900744954
maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients .    4.251822784425279
in two cases , a UNK mask was used to bring the maxilla forward , ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by UNK .    3.4504526211171833
in all patients , planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved ; one partial relapse occurred .    3.1475446359314745
the results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability .    3.1319649533091845
the technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure .    3.1929316989637333
we report a rare case of primary UNK neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult .    3.105249194211877
a huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62 - year - old man .    2.912428017033206
the patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital .    2.781694013339707
histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round - cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered homer - UNK UNK .    2.9173458164045742
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with UNK , a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein UNK / UNK .    3.564438458383373
focally , tumour cells stained positively for vimentin , nse , s - 100 protein and UNK .    2.924259557353677
the patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge , partly exophytic but mainly UNK tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue .    2.894586201712469
the differential diagnosis of small round - cell tumours in this location is discussed .    3.040644124666221
lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes .    3.8083365774898756
in a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction , the acetabulum should be UNK by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements .    3.1699079752118138
severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum .    3.1176513124320944
then rotation of the femoral neck and / or UNK of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15 - 20 ° of anteversion are indicated .    3.9067094310024704
our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy .    3.14341376525198
it is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20 - 30 ° anteriorly from the frontal ( coronal ) plane .    3.037269097166111
the osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation , but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum , and the ligaments between the sacrum and UNK are left in normal tension .    3.68328506652795
our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain .    3.6311540503357356
the optimum is reached with a ce angle and a vca angle of 30 - 35 ° , an angle of the weight - bearing zone of + 5 to - 5 ° and a migration index of 10 - 15 % .    3.1108955079595186
UNK again caused pain and should be avoided .    3.253084163357948
diminished anteversion of femur and acetabulum towards 0 ° also caused pain and should be corrected by triple and femoral osteotomy to 15 - 20 ° of anteversion .    2.8060998257971703
in earlier follow - ups of 216 hips 5 - 10 years postoperatively , 82 . 3 % of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis .    4.235853993764578
survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected , while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 % .    3.0468437716492027
background : leber ' s hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease .    3.2326379079934235
these mutations affect nucleotide positions UNK , 11 778 and 14 UNK .    3.010362750355802
heparin - induced thrombocytopenia type ii ( hit type ii ) is an immunoglobulin - mediated , drug - induced side effect for heparin - treated patients with thromboembolic complications .    3.3993442390353397
with an incidence of 1 - 3 % , mortality of 20 % it and permanent disability for another 20 % is a clinically relevant disorder .    3.6771780406245496
with heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary .    3.108168458838192
if hit type ii is suspected , further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started .    3.4939827425448344
the two anticoagulant options in germany are discussed .    3.1381458719797597
at the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing , including testing for cross - reactivity with danaparoid .    3.0935253588760343
further therapy depends on the symptoms .    3.749988925737579
in the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis : strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low - molecular - weight heparin ( lmwh ) for routine prophylaxis , use of lmwh for thrombosis treatment and early change to UNK .    2.984196069615341
a patented low - temperature polymerization method for UNK ( mma ) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described : it has been developed from our previous mma technique and is a patented procedure .    3.419560392872383
differences from the previous method are ( 1 ) removal of UNK from the mma UNK before its application , ( 2 ) the use of a different starter , ( 3 ) avoidance of o2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with n2 , and ( 4 ) UNK in a water bath to draw off residual heat .    3.8596403662323495
after this procedure , all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate .    3.331789119032828
the effects of different UNK are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis .    3.5368297765261114
technically , this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification .    3.675435419142064
the advantages over the latter method are : ( 1 ) the cells can be better differentiated because semi - thin sections can be made ; ( 2 ) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi - thin sections , which means they can be interpreted more easily ; ( 3 ) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections ; ( 4 ) UNK examination of bone trabeculae , especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies , is possible ; ( 5 ) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved .    3.5683711958626074
furthermore , it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below dm 100 , 000 including an excellent UNK .    2.8445835836704862
the routine use of succinylcholine for endotracheal intubation is being increasingly questioned .    3.010984216490407
initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions .    3.192992588688051
however , most of these initial studies either did not have a double - blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants .    3.480670088485803
in this study , intubation conditions using fentanyl / propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl / propofol / succinylcholine and sodium thiopental / succinylcholine .    2.9330899778985953
nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem , especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients .    3.8111935994566797
the endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients , because it facilitates UNK and UNK host defense .    4.286448083851262
common nosocomial pathogens like UNK UNK are known to produce UNK and generate a complex biofilm structure , which allows adhesion to UNK surfaces and protection against antibiotic action .    3.4759802666425044
multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes , which represents a permanent source of infectious material .    2.9497496130571204
endotracheal tubes , removed from patients with ventilator - associated pneumonia , are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls .    3.122528804081993
it remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination .    3.0043248498985258
bacterial biofilm , however , may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient .    3.2504744412804962
computer - guided robot - assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3d workstation orthodoc .    3.056836903777104
only the robodoc procedure allows the precise UNK of the preoperative plan in surgery .    3.913104863461597
robot - assisted surgery has been undergoing clinical evaluation at the UNK UNK , frankfurt , since november 1994 .    3.957034535674462
in all UNK patients , the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively .    3.8887921548522675
the high precision in reaming , leading to a UNK bone implant contact , UNK absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone .    3.335082518457008
the common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of robodoc .    3.2221463321892285
although immediate full - weight bearing was strongly recommended to the patients , no implant UNK was seen in the regular follow - up x ray studies .    4.229726270491892
in this study we describe 22 cases of retrograde ureteral stent placement in pregnant women with therapy - resistant flank pain due to hydronephrosis .    2.842337519440746
eleven were UNK and one patient expected twins .    4.149845104467829
eight of 22 patients presented symptoms of pyelonephritis .    3.2153087650452203
in 21 cases the hydronephrosis was located on the right and in 4 cases it was bilateral .    4.15310127123432
maximal lower UNK diameter was 12 mm ( range 9 - 22 mm ) .    3.2991778973587897
with the exception of two cases , sonographically controlled stent placement was performed under local anesthesia without sedation .    2.878493714912419
all patients were painfree within 6 days and were given prophylactic low UNK of antibiotic until the day of delivery .    3.137436071770631
renal function remained within the normal limits .    3.2039567879817206
double - j stent displacement occured in 3 patients - of which one underwent nephrostomy .    3.504380551281044
postnatal examination demonstrated urolithiasis in 4 of 19 patients .    3.6237020977972816
this study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral double - j stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate .    3.320287950866462
between 1981 and 1994 at the bergmannsheil ruhr university hospital in bochum , germany , we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment .    3.14757585789118
of these patients , 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution .    3.3285167555383426
the primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases , reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases .    2.8976730938621573
the average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years .    3.8057127041370844
twenty - seven patients ( 19 % ) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 ( 81 % ) with an atrophic nonunion .    3.3443029288562975
there was a significant correlation between primary " classic " plating and development of an atrophic nonunion ( 2 - test : p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.960344508961453
we observed 34 wound infections ( 23 % ) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis .    3.775432286470781
we determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to UNK osteosynthesis techniques .    3.4463375357503123
of these cases , 41 % involved the use of plates , 83 % involved the use of reamed nails , and 78 % involved the use of external fixators .    3.5654282813758806
fracture location near the diaphyseal - metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group .    2.95198479503443
ninety - two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions .    2.679293933154762
there were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % ( n = 19 ) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % ( n = 6 ) developed a wound infection .    3.225265495938859
fifty - seven ( 39 % ) of all patients had additional injuries , but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing .    3.8062483557922913
our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections , UNK of bone healing , and improvement in fragment stability .    4.003799256684876
only 28 % of all " classic " plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery .    3.9946302237981737
hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1 . 3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.0216211368984554
in cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions .    3.405933433208991
since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative x - rays , we recommend that revision procedures be performed early .    3.216465723227951
the prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment .    3.1182032771094788
that takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing .    3.3003588621691033
background : in a prospective trial ( october 1996 - april 1998 ) the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after r0 resection was evaluated .    3.273834587487999
methods : patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily .    3.4688202435221007
the median survival time , quality of life ( eortc - qlq - 30 ) and side effects of the octreotide - tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort ( n = 14 ) of patients treated in our department ( 9 / 95 - 9 / 96 ) according to the " best supportive care " concept .    3.367025653923506
results : recurrences were diagnosed after r0 resection in a mean time of 13 + / - 6 . 8 months .    3.4676422949084333
patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) longer median survival time ( 7 months ; range : 3 - 12 ) vs 3 . 5 months ; range : 1 . 5 - 5 ) .    3.8130877394320017
the octreotide - tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite , nausea , fatigue , and pain and needed fewer UNK .    2.7749158602722432
the only side effect of the octreotide - tamoxifen therapy was moderate UNK in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy .    3.4095651264847033
conclusion : since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered UNK for outpatient treatment , this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer .    3.2615609833463424
objective : to study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one - lung ventilation ( olv ) .    2.925450954409969
design : prospective , randomised , placebo - controlled study .    2.9862918109695396
patients : twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection .    3.1578660841246955
anaesthesia : general anaesthesia was performed using propofol , fentanyl , n2o and vecuronium . volume - controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period .    3.6159944808023554
during olv , the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm h2o .    3.194817971476322
furthermore the fio2 was increased to 1 , 0 and the external peep was removed during olv .    3.6418059364456776
measurement and results : the following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded : heart rate , mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure .    3.6263482388311736
cardiac output was measured by thermodilution using a continuous cardiac output thermodilution catheter .    3.3644855267473157
arterial and mixed venous blood gas analysis were measured from simultaneously drawn samples .    3.173815780746435
cardiac index ( ci ) , systemic vascular resistance index , pulmonary vascular resistance index , oxygen delivery index ( do2i ) , oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula .    3.0610210090238463
furthermore , pressure - flow - curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance .    3.1359843165325993
data were recorded at the following times : after induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two - lung ventilation ( baseline values , t0 ) , intraoperatively during one - lung ventilation ( t1 ) and postoperatively after re - establishing two - lung ventilation ( t2 ) .    2.730371497124587
patients characteristics , data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups .    3.6884873026237384
ci increased in the dopexamine group from 2 , 5 + / - 1 , 2 l - min - 1 - m - 2 ( t0 ) to 3 , 6 + / - 0 , 9 l - min - 1 - m - 2 ( t1 ) and 4 , 0 + / - 1 , 3 l - min - 1 - m - 2 ( t2 ) .    3.3122769444461593
the course of the intrapulmonary right - to - left shunting did not differ between the groups .    2.7631496616834297
in the dopexamine - treated group the do2i increased from 430 + / - 143 ml - min - m - 2 ( t0 ) to UNK + / - UNK ml - min - m - 2 ( t1 ) and 653 + / - 207 ml - min - m - 2 ( t2 ) .    2.6202079950534944
regarding the pressure - flow - curves there was no difference during olv between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction .    3.0270162815107593
conclusion : it is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one - lung ventilation .    2.8603939471418403
functional cine mri of the pelvic floor is a yet another modality in addition to various radiological UNK techniques .    3.517579765532241
this article describes our own method in view of the recent UNK and provides morphometric reference values .    3.1143451392180257
background : the influence of cyanosis , and cardiac index in children with cyanotic heart disease on their growth velocity .    3.491318360277148
regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group .    3.6659835618103496
therefore since april 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the department of dermatology of the ruhr - university of bochum .    3.0075475506062546
the aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination .    2.560606770958014
the study was based on anonymous questionnaires .    3.5303211365913088
mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31 . 4 ; 67 of then were born in germany .    3.0034924124195546
78 of the women always used condoms , while 71 thought that condoms prevent stds .    3.145114468352153
three women suffered from a std in the last 12 months .    4.12882054603291
the majority the women ( 75 from this 80 prostitutes ) did not perceive the examination as discrimination , while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality .    3.1914196644395636
these results indicate that regular mandatory examinations should be part of health prevention care of prostitutes and that they are well accepted and tolerated by these women .    2.892212822178543
atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery .    3.2304154631076667
as more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases , the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again .    3.6172657490871716
there are some unresolved problems of this complication .    3.035904327954023
reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature .    3.797252006319891
usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient , self - limiting , and benign .    3.7153962579950797
nevertheless , among patients affected by this arrhythmia , morbidity , mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication .    3.0602130849750773
in addition , postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself .    2.871108940657799
today , general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future .    3.7991758260217523
according to the clinical course , therapy has to consider ventricular rate control , prevention of thromboembolic events , and rhythm control .    3.269456672448584
usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time .    3.554671698020947
the influence of aspirin treatment on UNK is still under debate .    3.20148096170041
there are doubts in emergency operations , especially in transplant patients , concerning dosage and change in medication .    3.331919729382881
our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in german transplantation centres .    3.572613610426488
the question of transplant suitability , dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature .    3.0530261265648644
some 92 . 11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin .    3.8764006098179493
in these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34 . 2 % of the centres .    3.396888693775409
an increased mortality has not been reported .    3.1265056977381005
most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily .    2.9933589816473183
only 7 . 89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin - treated patients .    3.2992720315854327
correctly indicated aspirin treatment ( for cardiac arrhythmia , embolism , or thrombosis , for example ) does not UNK renal transplantation ( daily dosage up to 100 mg ) .    3.4165658224721014
full - thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection , irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient - specific treatment modalities .    3.2962760940823452
plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage , stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities , is presented and critically discussed .    3.1663465330552074
incomplete anaesthesia is a major clinical problem both in single spinal and in single epidural anaesthesia .    3.675929488558541
the clinical efficacy of epidural anaesthesia with augmentation ( UNK ) and combined epidural and spinal anesthesia ( UNK ) for cesarean section was investigated in a prospective randomized study on 45 patients .    3.816130031528559
this retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the UNK orthopädische UNK of the UNK UNK in the time between 31 . 10 . 1979 and 31 . 10 . 1994 .    4.728628984986917
it could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures , due to their variety , hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a UNK therapeutic procedure .    3.2244499223148195
among the operation methods the k - wire UNK with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i . e .    3.133845943451718
the k - wire without cerclage was used in two cases .    3.686570628012486
UNK fractures were treated with ao - plate - osteosynthesis .    3.717052165414295
three fractures had to be treated by resection , as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious ac - arthrosis during the conservative therapy .    3.5324879204357216
92 , 7 % of the subjective results of the 41 checked up patients were good and very good .    4.317264754090801
insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis are thought to stem from UNK processes .    3.045582700033909
we describe a 14 year old female adolescent , in whom both diseases manifested almost at the same time .    3.089243531614376
from august 1987 to december 1995 , 79 patients underwent surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism .    3.2666651771851507
it was the first neck exploration for 72 patients .    3.131345245053163
total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to a forearm was our preferred procedure ( n = 67 ) .    3.128759112648846
the postoperative course of all patients is known .    3.499777037534085
we carried out one to nine UNK ( median 4 ) in 74 of 79 patients .    3.322796503645096
the follow - up period ranged from 1 month to 5 years with a median of 18 months .    3.5446147173848264
after the operation transient hypocalcaemia occurred in 84 . 8 % of patients .    3.418847078067947
postoperative hypocalcaemia correlated negatively with the preoperative levels of alkaline phosphatase and intact parathyroid hormone .    2.8151927238152155
within the first month after surgery 60 % of the preoperatively affected patients completely recovered from pruritus , whereas the skeletal syndrome took longer to disappear .    3.527199542121586
one year after surgery 75 % of the patients with pruritus and 79 % of those with skeletal syndrome had became asymptomatic .    3.3346370951061153
after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation , patients with preoperatively elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase ( > 200 u / l ) experienced faster relief from joint pain than patients with preoperatively normal concentrations ( p = 0 . UNK ) .    2.952645436282048
to date 4 . 5 % of the patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation .    3.371156452668325
morbidity of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism is influenced by patients ' risk factors .    3.605096068451036
postoperative hypocalcaemia correlates negatively with the grade of renal UNK at the time of operation .    3.3203646114682934
preoperative concentrations of alkaline phosphatase influence the rapidity of the relief from joint pain .    2.7994112636991453
coronary artery stenosis with need for therapy is rarely seen in childhood .    3.335739154063817
a 15 - year - old girl with hypercholesterinaemia type ii a was undergoing lipid UNK therapy ( once or twice a week ) since she was 6 years old .    3.0998660065756165
single stage UNK with an UNK patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease .    3.492599123530736
using buccal mucosa , operative time is substantially reduced by using a two - team approach in which one team UNK the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and UNK the stricture .    3.466379347920514
excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures .    3.649393144098721
focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed .    3.4422795390363237
for patients with long or dense strictures , grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques .    3.406867016688902
background : as the slit - lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in - vivo examination and documentation of the multi - layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea , e . g . during wound - healing processes , our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope ( UNK ; zeiss ) into a high - resolution confocal laser scanning microscope ( UNK ) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system .    3.377221863877466
in order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent UNK keratectomy ( UNK ) , as well as some in - vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy ( prk ) .    3.490143751239836
from 3 years ' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis ( tipp ) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication , anesthesia , modification of the technique , and results are reported .    3.2910873803124816
after intraoperative classification of the hernia , the tipp repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall ( l / m iii ) .    3.4294678054904715
the procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia .    2.9970951300902113
during 52 local tipp repairs , conversion of anesthesia was never necessary .    2.990579923490766
important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh ( 10 cm x 15 cm ) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted UNK for each .    3.519440624253535
apart from an increased number of UNK ( 12 % ) in the early postoperative period , the results of the tipp are comparable with those obtained after shouldice repair for recurrent hernia .    3.975142927490952
the rate of hematomas , infections , and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 % .    3.2561293740530117
considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias , the tipp repair reveals a favourably low 1 - year recurrence rate of 1 % .    3.24771416043576
if representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug UNK by internal bodily UNK and refers the person to hospital , the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug UNK by induction of emesis with UNK of UNK or UNK a .    3.7759950088908125
the permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial .    2.9692172450891365
the UNK , the public UNK or the judge has to decide , whether the induction of emesis is really necessary , the physician has to UNK the risks .    3.9715115440692115
the deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components : the parallel anterocaudad slip of the UNK UNK , and its tilt into kyphotic malposition .    3.6514913084200646
the influence of the two components is very different : the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar UNK .    3.377927637144619
the kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile .    3.2134496209810908
there are two compensation mechanisms : UNK of the lumbar spine to its anatomical UNK and - if that is not sufficient - UNK of the sacral bone , performed by contracture of the hamstrings and UNK of the pelvis around the hip joints .    4.044035962797958
the latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages .    3.3669643932740563
therefore , correction of the kyphosis of l5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis ( angle delta ) is less than 85 ° and the sacral inclination less than 35 ° .    3.0094636054044357
the diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg .    3.175919685601046
the first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination .    3.3248194659472876
it provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis .    3.35180563555162
even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure .    3.3641452958279556
the diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain x - ray of the whole leg .    3.275526402307199
in this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a . p . view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs .    3.518133625852293
today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the ct scan .    3.068800263847472
however , the multitude of analytical methods for ct measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison ; thus , it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice .    3.173278726863943
not every ct measurement is better than a physical examination .    3.249019807628436
evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results .    3.164144812151654
up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the ulm ct method .    3.7312815400478163
one alternative is the mr scan , which avoids radiological risks , but the reproducibility and accuracy of the mri method are not as good as for the ct method .    3.4153110323429297
another alternative is ultrasound , where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of mri .    3.499374183286532
the three - dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non - radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents .    3.4618182412402785
this method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults .    3.01800144577759
purpose : management of organ - confined rcc is primarily surgical .    2.986427163907046
5 - year survival rates of all stages improved from 40 % in the UNK to 50 % in the UNK , and UNK at 60 % in recent series .    5.112633039403713
paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of rcc thus better amenable for radical operation .    3.0661799340297438
other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care .    3.3201503341645937
however , it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested UNK UNK in a UNK paper in the UNK bears any therapeutic value .    4.052785083777064
selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) , who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis , were included in a prospective study .    3.2851088798656876
from march 1994 to march 1996 in 178 outpatients ( 118 men , 60 women , mean age 25 , 8 [ 16 - 39 ] years ) a clinical examination and a colour - coded duplex sonography were performed after UNK of the cast for detection of dvt of the lower limb .    3.352731635377219
a UNK was performed when thrombosis was suspected .    3.0469314326575496
two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf .    3.408935542290474
clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed .    3.296827574485243
these results suggest , that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis .    3.4061658294924144
for the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded .    3.8705103353380554
therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic , which consists of standard nomenclature , classification , instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards .    3.007675902566745
there are a group of problems and UNK which stand in the way of this goal .    3.7720167214267923
it is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical UNK in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care , quality management and research .    3.1113754598149623
basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the who ' s " histologic typing of salivary gland tumours " in 1991 .    3.3503320167280095
this tumor was first described in 1990 by UNK and UNK from the UNK forces institute of pathology ( UNK ) .    3.669420819686533
basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2 . 9 % of all salivary gland malignancies .    3.734986275371401
more than 90 % of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland .    3.3238792710746434
intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only .    3.640588781337099
tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases .    3.783129193253308
histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma .    2.920596452890181
the case presented here is a middle - aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate .    3.3294419238946547
therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three - dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins .    3.1426266814597814
knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence ( up to 50 % ) and a mostly UNK metastatic potential for as long as 10 years after removal of the primary tumor .    3.8035299781446312
ten year survival is around 75 % .    3.264369699229897
purpose : to study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the UNK eye in the case of clinically , slit - lamp UNK and UNK diagnosed unilateral disease .    3.851707204098632
ischemic heart disease is the most frequent cause of death in industrialized countries .    3.50966745370166
this is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population .    3.592356232734791
medical progress with application of conservative , surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases , but markedly increased the medical care costs .    3.2301057502118278
the result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine .    3.346013305163448
the ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications .    2.9563858809854056
in patients with liver disease with portal hypertension , however , the risk of recurrent , UNK conduit bleeding is increased .    4.029367026795488
while the diagnosis is simple , several therapeutic options are available .    3.518911992581231
in most cases the bleeding comes from UNK varices , that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3 % UNK or ligation of the bleeding vessel .    3.221219814563936
the resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised .    3.2931558171347226
if bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered .    3.3638453872085337
malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source .    3.167580482428047
objectives : the UNK properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in - vitro , as well as under in - UNK conditions .    3.7219282077577436
a further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies .    3.0353965565079832
the aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a UNK perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic UNK and their UNK by wash - out with UNK - csf .    3.55384619081961
in recent years , our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) has greatly expanded .    2.8941943863810677
this , in turn , has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain - injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage .    3.4794164791542315
the present article focuses on the pathophysiology of tbi and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention .    3.05483446905961
while some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of tbi , others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages .    3.732373633769302
this study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia .    2.8372435707278765
a questionnaire for self - assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas ( the UNK schizophrenia inventory , or UNK ) was constructed and administered to first - episode schizophrenics ( sche , n = 45 ) , negative syndrome schizophrenics ( schn , n = 45 ) , UNK schizophrenics ( UNK , n = 24 ) , depressives ( dep , n = 43 ) , alcoholics ( alk , n = 48 ) , obsessive - compulsive patients ( zwa , n = 46 ) , and healthy controls ( UNK , n = 57 ) .    3.4109022775305244
comparisons between the sche , schn , dep , alk , and zwa groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia - specific dimensions : attention and speech impairment ( as ) , ideas of reference ( ir ) , auditory uncertainty ( au ) , and deviant perception ( dp ) .    2.870710819808119
further analyses suggested that the as syndrome may represent a mediating vulnerability factor while ir , au , and dp probably are reversible episode indicators .    2.8859419447140513
introduction : the conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( UNK ) can be sometimes UNK .    4.671830771261746
especially with an underlying UNK disorder , even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface .    3.587374663925627
a microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland ( sg ) can be performed by a maxillo - facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases .    3.5127967922914243
we report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure .    4.008784670648872
aims : the predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence .    3.373890848036735
the sequelae of surgical resection and high - dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy , leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease .    4.180813294214727
therefore , this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism .    3.606996819819967
materials and methods : we reviewed a total of 50 [ 18f ] - 2 - fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18fdg - pet ) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer .    3.2446392247254234
in 23 cases , re - staging ( group a ) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation .    3.0717758149100725
in 27 cases , pet served as a screening procedure ( group b ) .    3.1713941733994933
statistic evaluation included sensitivity , specifity , positive / negative predictive value and accuracy of 18fdg - pet for the detection of tumor manifestation .    3.338828464312937
results : 18fdg - pet correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites ( 88 % ) in the re - staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites ( 90 % ) in the screening group .    3.6757074841253035
we encountered a total number of 16 false - positive foci with an increased 18fdg - uptake .    3.810141822193331
in six patients , 18fdg - pet detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological UNK could be identified .    3.089951100381577
in 5 of these 6 patients , the pet findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient ' s fate .    3.766796958902098
specificity was 63 % for local recurrence , 97 % for secondary lymph node involvement and 90 % for distant metastasis .    3.5664743878758043
conclusion : according to these data , 18fdg - pet is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow - up of oral cancer patients to date .    3.5689028608087514
due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow - up of oral cancer , either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional , incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management .    3.4104475931043603
we therefore recommend 18fdg - pet for screening and re - staging of recurrent oral cancer .    2.6692276841643148
in over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease , the nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long - term results .    3.5004247754489843
dysphagia , inability to UNK or UNK as well as the gas UNK syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication .    3.9667623234688523
failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon .    3.0866077555724276
here , reoperation with UNK of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication .    3.933830033075781
technical alternatives may selectively be chosen , when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated UNK hernia , esophageal shortening , or serious esophageal motility disorders .    2.8409078915803376
such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy , barium swallow , 24 - h ph monitoring , and manometry .    2.8648459962066437
alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs , including the nissen fundoplication , UNK gastroplasty , and the UNK mark iv .    3.9113006517518496
modifications of the 360 ° nissen operation are partial UNK like the hill repair and the toupet dorsal fundoplication .    3.028249079981145
because of a high failure rate in the long - term follow - up , application of the ligamentum UNK UNK and of the UNK prosthesis is not recommended .    5.082972932818022
we report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy ( gan ) starting in a 5 - year - old boy with gait disturbance .    2.808397625828797
at the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms : intention tremor , nystagmus and visual disturbance .    2.9569880307472727
the boy also had UNK hair .    3.166204049435127
sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of UNK , which were also found in cytoplasma of schwann cells , endothelial cells and fibrocytes .    3.314757139646336
our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of gan .    3.6418005464041654
the endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way .    3.028130039098812
between 1 october 1994 and 7 may 1995 , 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study .    3.370545812810417
there were not any complaints , or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases .    3.0832726773660246
there were continuing complaints in four cases , and after an additional check two patients were operated on again .    3.9886118744043753
the advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative UNK .    3.113139732187642
however , blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia .    4.197709849434797
the waves could be recorded again immediately after the mean arterial pressure was increased from 48 to 77 mmhg .    3.4397542851997165
the oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0 . 3 ° c at this time .    3.43121634224662
the 2 - channel electroencephalogram ( eeg ) showed no irregularities during this time period .    3.0387517922854568
a bilateral , reversible , apparently blood - pressure - dependent loss of waves i and ii during arterial hypotension despite a normal eeg has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature .    3.0932604788026197
the isolated loss of waves i and ii with maintenance of waves iii , iv , and v is unusual .    2.9617078743897713
the literature contains reports of acoustic UNK patients in whom only wave v could be recorded .    3.011249836243311
this is regarded as an indication of continued impulse conduction despite the loss of waves i to iv .    3.2615523291223085
others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of baep wave i due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus .    3.181987767774732
assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the baep waves , a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves i and ii .    3.0813140547896225
another potential source could be the induced hypothermia , but this does not seem very likely because the patient ' s temperature was 0 . 3 ° c lower at the return of the waves than at their loss .    3.6250391601986913
in the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy , little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias .    3.401388300118394
in a group of 54 patients with documented ventricular tachycardia during longterm ecg recordings , the determinants for the development of vt and the relationship between signal - averaged ecg and the morphological characteristics of the disease are investigated .    3.632882266068669
normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ecg signal UNK with bidirectional filters between 40 and UNK were defined a maximum of UNK for a qrs width , las of 38ms , and UNK of UNK .    3.7563637185165835
the analysis of the long - term ecg produced monomorphic vt in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats .    3.26609648485584
a long - short phenomenon could only be proven in UNK episodes .    3.4774232709333623
in 84 % of all tachycardias , no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event .    3.7325631099831282
according to the circadian clock , two peaks , mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h , could be determined .    2.7603378457370855
in patients , who were recently diagnosed with arvd , a significant shortening of the rr intervals before the onset of vt as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed .    3.5702194652709163
this effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of avrd .    4.473250360984283
late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74 % overall .    3.585329106931287
increasingly , late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the arvd .    3.7214151894173173
a correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias ( ventricular , sustained or not sustained vt ) could not be established .    3.460208189694124
in comparison to the origin of vt in coronary heart disease , previous arrhythmias play a less important role in UNK right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy .    3.223013486748405
most importantly , an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of vt and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed .    3.270463966777894
a local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two endoscopic debridements and lavage .    3.402804349004234
additionally , the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains .    3.3975893184519053
this therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump .    3.5561750730109694
we describe an eighteen - months - old boy , who suffered from congenital UNK UNK , UNK , microcephaly , facial UNK and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8 .    3.0761861402389896
in most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic , often because of bike accidents .    2.691023091087329
if physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome , muscle transfer operations are possible .    3.215050063300584
the results of our favored transfer of the trapezius muscle to compensate paralysis of the deltoid muscle will be presented .    2.7204388311319825
preoperatively radiological , clinical and UNK examinations are necessary .    3.8892974801977305
our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients .    3.473220268738615
thirty - one patients ( 7 female , 24 male ) underwent a trapezius transfer between march 1994 and december 1996 .    2.933636939762718
the average age was 29 years ( range 18 - 46 years ) .    2.9734039298620103
we performed the operations using a modification of UNK ' s technique .    3.1525518930625593
with the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus , a UNK skin incision is the first step , followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder ( acromion , clavicle , scapular spine ) .    3.8426744013101777
the deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle , the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine .    3.3644098917328433
the next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle .    2.859858935263167
after elevation of the remaining trapezius UNK from the clavicle and scapular spine , the proximal humerus is UNK by splitting the partly UNK deltoid muscle longitudinally .    3.4178931110365687
then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone - to - bone contact .    3.577340862338972
in 90 ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4 . 5 - mm screws .    3.2163036464243455
finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains .    3.049712965862705
postoperatively we UNK the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks .    3.3213988487289456
the physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow , hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle .    2.7881342753067417
six weeks after the procedure we take an x - ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm .    3.130582521647689
the preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases .    3.1248337928380248
we achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7 . 3 ° ( range 0 - 45 ° ) preoperatively to 39 . 2 ° ( range 25 ° - 80 ° ) 1 year after the operation ; the increase of forward flexion was from 20 ° ( range 0 ° - 85 ° ) to 43 ° ( range 20 ° - 90 ° ) .    3.541412714169929
all patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder .    3.4127815726297377
finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for UNK shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients .    3.5032985169019315
the following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to dsm - iii - r and idc - 10 seem appropriate .    2.761252636762101
first , the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising , since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives UNK in dsm - iii - r may also have an aggressive motive .    2.897868842063875
second , icd - 10 gives being UNK and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania .    3.189091561063967
this seems UNK , since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol UNK .    3.0685158690190155
repeated firesetting , resulting from being UNK by fire etc . , may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a UNK , which , supported by alcohol abuse , extends into older age .    3.763526634028458
the mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years .    2.801580640277243
the tendency for relapses after UNK seems to be low ; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age .    2.9639750082360066
the mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years , those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35 , UNK arsonists have a mean age of 40 years .    2.9692412554548175
concrete sexual motives are relatively rare .    3.465623089311635
approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive .    3.4786134417460453
UNK is a rare cause , however , since most of them do not even know the victims .    3.907334136291805
one third of these persons set the fire in their own homes .    3.033087541872034
most arsonists show a personality disorder , with insecurity and narcissism UNK .    3.0805093968395654
data on firesetting are to be treated with caution , since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved ; one fourth of cases concern minors , and in central europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists .    3.462897345119408
a normal ciliary beat frequency of UNK cells is necessary for the UNK clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses .    3.467279561884891
an in vitro investigation was performed to UNK - UNK the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa .    3.8383610743463694
the nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or UNK UNK and the topical antihistamines UNK or UNK .    3.668444310640329
all tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions .    3.353201605099363
three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative .    2.7463214770254134
an irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution .    3.2307220867712396
the nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride - free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min .    2.8141729280992536
as benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa , we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications .    3.0147038557528627
the treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres .    2.9697057114466716
in our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to june 1995 ( between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients ) .    3.1023687641404347
patients were evaluated according to the absi score ( mean 7 ) and had mortality of around 15 % .    3.411649835591126
the costs range between 3 . 7 and 4 . 8 million dm per year , the profit lies in the same range .    4.06891643960904
the costs are divided into staff costs ( 1 . 4 - 1 . 8 million dm per year ) , costs for medical treatment ( 1 . 5 - 1 . 9 million dm per year ) and costs for internal services ( 600 000 - 900 000 dm per year ) such as laboratory examinations ( 247 000 - UNK 000 dm per year ) and blood bank ( 100 000 - 215 000 dm per year ) , the main factors in this category .    3.3036441132689447
the different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis .    3.193326760780223
possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out , and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed .    4.124931803160669
conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses , the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients .    3.3487094531238255
in benign UNK stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied .    3.2806636603851906
this review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction .    3.208009608426253
after an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated , UNK measurements at rest are collected .    3.0438981085734453
among these , peak expiratory flow rate ( UNK ) proved to be the UNK and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways .    4.157764983716824
a novel technique for UNK assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail .    3.1308009589115624
in contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions , this test identifies the pressure - flow - relationship created exclusively by the local lesion .    2.81588749662645
in serial stenoses , it indicates which is of higher clinical impact .    3.0997055538471203
patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity .    3.012479482704995
they tend to UNK with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue .    3.632263906675609
therefore , UNK may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load .    3.2323131344194196
the decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis .    3.1032940712608914
stroke units are hospital - based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute UNK .    3.689883641730807
following the initial UNK - UNK and neuroradiological evaluation , early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke .    3.9903323274276388
acute management includes monitoring of physiological , parameters , care by specialized nurses , and early implementation of physiotherapists , speech therapy and occupational therapy .    2.93719042218455
despite the increased initial costs , the long - term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability .    3.5108070815535637
heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) is the most important side - effect of heparin therapy .    3.1508840045091513
two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin : a frequent non - immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and , on the other hand , an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications .    2.8732753794096593
patients and methods : we report on two cases with hit type ii after coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) .    2.6820526428902935
hit antibodies were demonstrated by elisa for platelet - factor - 4 - heparin - complex and heparin - induced platelet - activation ( UNK ) assay .    3.85630069003067
results : a 67 year old patient suffered from a hit type ii seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization .    3.1338639729278186
in this patient , a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms .    3.3469365761886207
the clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy .    2.9977888865029056
thromboembolic complications did not occur .    3.0461844631459174
a 70 year old patient developed a hit type ii with thromboembolic complications 13 days after cabg .    3.41835812363377
the vascular occlusions affected the a . spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior - syndrome , the coronary arteries with the development of UNK infarction , and the a . UNK UNK .    3.982773085093466
a white - UNK syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta , in the left atrium , and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation .    4.244323458804904
conclusion : with therapy with heparin , it is obligatory to check platelet count .    3.475363817671203
an indication for the development of hit type ii is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy .    3.7276080772628992
in the case of hit type ii recombinant hirudin was a practical UNK as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration .    2.8840112944270864
oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury , sepsis , and multiple organ failure .    3.551013069517002
injured patients , patients with pulmonary diseases , and multiple trauma patients also showed an elevated lipid peroxidation , indicating increased oxidant stress .    4.0671601573427765
n - UNK ( nac ) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments .    4.485821598934999
nac has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine , and hence glutathione , and by scavenging of oxidant species [ 1 , 11 , 17 , 29 ] .    3.4301410283451284
the present study was designed to investigate whether the application of nac in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( UNK ) and on the lipid peroxidation products UNK and conjugated UNK .    3.1456194576571783
because nac has been widely used as a UNK drug for the treatment of lung diseases , the influence on UNK mucus was studied , too .    4.485512024432917
between 1990 and 1995 , 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion .    3.8598181556644398
preoperatively 24 patients ( 88 . 89 % ) suffered from pain ; 15 ( 55 . 56 % ) had a walking range below 100 m . seven patients were unable to work in their original profession .    3.5430938304773134
after an average period of 13 . 85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again .    3.670510298999243
at this time 18 ( 66 . 67 % ) had no or minimal pain ; 19 ( 70 . 37 % ) had no claudication .    3.088528521931217
according to the score of UNK and UNK , in 81 . 48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful ; according to kitaoka ' s clinical rating system for ankle - hindfoot , midfoot , hallux and lesser toes , the average postoperative score was 75 . 8 points .    3.610992654404126
objective : to examine changes in body mass index ( bmi ) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity .    3.371943265772208
the review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls .    3.8136750790829526
in a random sample of 276 hospital in - patients aged 75 and over , the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed .    3.286822447181564
questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire .    3.3208481841940514
migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding , whereas UNK of lower jaw UNK is described much more often in the literature .    3.66303644592108
we present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years .    2.9483043492484815
most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the UNK muscularis took place after the root development had ended .    3.032034002883046
neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth .    3.0612979212970743
in atopic eczema patients the well - known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels ( white UNK , delayed UNK after acetylcholine , paradoxical UNK after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection ) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema - free state in comparison with controls .    3.172525551714474
in this follow - up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema .    3.835389106603679
severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema - free cutaneous state .    2.959327924539653
we report on a 9 - year - old girl with a giant cell UNK of the right anterior chest wall .    3.285447489275849
this rare soft tissue tumour occurs predominantly in the first two decades of life .    3.510531682269355
the histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis .    2.8148908969469253
characteristic elements of the tumour are large UNK branching spaces lacking any UNK - or epithelium , and relatively small multinucleated cells ( UNK cells ) .    3.170726723899502
the recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins .    2.8807815017331397
it is of pre - eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas , in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy .    3.3247379182256824
to correct severe septal deformities , it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage , followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft .    3.541930690475465
the utilization of a compound graft , which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon ( pds ) foil , facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum .    2.9493902028846035
stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females .    3.552364842883567
the usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral .    3.346794086999401
two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with stamey and colposuspension in accordance with burch - were retrospectively investigated .    3.187426347985732
a total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 ( total 76 ) patients respectively .    3.4717783666133157
initially , both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate ( 91 . 3 % and 96 . 7 % resp . ) .    3.55374748958972
however , the continence rate of the stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78 . 3 % and after more than 2 years only 28 . 6 % of these patients were still completely continent ( mean follow - up 40 . 4 mths ) , whereas deterioration in the burch patients was only 87 % ( mean follow - up 44 . 25 mths ) .    3.8143821752018834
the disappointing results with the stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence .    3.3468014912758064
it was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression .    3.2301247769952957
the three cases of recurring incontinence after burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery .    3.371647625913796
with respect to long - term follow - up , our results with the stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the burch technique .    3.396831075846205
therefore , in our opinion , the burch colposuspension procedure and UNK should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence .    3.641370536303564
this paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders , an issue being neglected in german psychiatry for a long time .    2.9906435549167494
social inequality will be discussed in it ' s dimensions " socioeconomic status " and " sex " referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge .    3.287035623756513
because such UNK factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves UNK concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level .    3.3874875672532885
these concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur .    3.590556824951314
further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases , in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure , and last but not least a gender - sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more UNK .    3.138229213866623
it is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation , although influences on the voice are not assumed .    2.916387995101
in addition to the vocal fundamental frequency , vibrations of the vocal UNK generate overtones .    2.75355271278272
through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway , resonances and UNK are formed , and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent .    3.9212536278819967
UNK changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely .    3.373922847897902
the influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who UNK two different dental prostheses .    3.697143635134227
the fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture .    3.001070561861097
when the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement , a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture .    3.188962926867565
sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position .    3.784268946916652
this change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue , which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture .    3.680400688511804
in this situation , increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency , shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies .    3.00829898065191
these findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases .    2.7100636586005282
the etiology of this occurrence is still not clear .    2.93426763584743
its consequences , however , should be known to the dentist , ent surgeon and UNK if patients notice changes in their voice after having altered or replaced their dentures .    3.200907606096663
cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure , as a function of severity of disease .    4.1910232209782965
the source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research .    3.0606617927435225
potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation , a neurohumoral UNK with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an UNK of UNK from the UNK heart itself .    3.7154763881506834
we present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system , particularly interleukin 6 release .    3.1716868754942014
objectives : this 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the UNK and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach .    3.61317038314106
in addition , anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the UNK study group of the german society of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine ( UNK ) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey .    3.994472934955861
polar body analysis is a UNK tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation .    3.2646362167099143
this helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction , primarily in advanced maternal age patients .    2.8610869885167065
this might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients .    3.8025174768831955
polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal UNK or a mutation before they become pregnant .    2.93005475166697
however , it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the UNK tested and selected .    3.6360928566374886
ethical considerations do not play a role , since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos .    3.3007837113356633
pachydermoperiostosis ( UNK - erb - UNK syndrome , UNK - UNK - UNK syndrome ) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of UNK ; it occurs almost exclusively in men .    4.548119917141032
a report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31 - year - old man is presented .    2.9554285810196275
associated features were UNK digits of the hands and feet with UNK - crystal nails , thickening of the skin and soft tissues , hyperhidrosis of hands and feet , hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with UNK , UNK , and UNK abnormalities that had been present since puberty .    3.467125040174642
radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones .    3.2583866357126516
endocrine disturbances were not detected .    3.7804210483662612
skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages .    3.557204912418325
primary ( idiopathic , hereditary ) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary ( symptomatic ) forms of the disease , which are often associated with lung tumours .    3.335589186949109
the following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa .    2.8929792787007274
for both eating disorders , psychotherapy is the treatment of choice .    3.0753225385586878
in clinical practice " treatment UNK " are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders .    3.400447692448928
in bulimia nervosa , cognitive - behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful .    3.261199726395009
newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms .    3.301695435995771
UNK medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa .    4.036138253312427
recently , a UNK care approach to treatment has been recommended , with self - care UNK as the first step .    3.8922950748094993
in anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials .    3.420294973037474
UNK management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in - and outpatient treatments .    3.0796027099650347
family therapy , cognitive - behavioral therapy , and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice ; however , only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies .    3.7218209945109186
medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa .    4.129961248954288
absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection ( turp ) and percutaneous UNK ( UNK ) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a turp syndrome .    3.219182765860036
the measurement of end - tidal breath alcohol concentration ( et ac ) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2 % ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide ( n2o ) ( fig .    2.857076012849004
an electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method .    3.2703455016382206
the aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device ( UNK UNK , UNK ) .    3.1674800165232226
in a clinical investigation , the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients UNK volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery .    3.0217422210600002
skin diseases , the UNK and psychological changes are often UNK , especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion .    4.83954003713074
in many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary .    2.8911478394184384
this resource may help with the diagnosis , explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability .    4.312328725516446
the different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered .    3.1350584092100164
the role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples .    2.920310821001863
we investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation .    2.6806255815550974
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the UNK depression rating scale .    3.9842046507486875
the patients were divided into two groups according to their age .    2.727164114940551
the result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti - UNK effect of sleep deprivation .    2.914407106950615
during mri - controlled resection of brain tumors using an open mri system , operation - induced alterations may occur , especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall .    3.4023306736622114
this may simulate tumor areas , resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non - tumorous areas .    3.805130838760497
based on 42 mri - and biopsy - controlled brain tumor resections in an 0 . 5 t open mri ( UNK sp , ge ) , the appearance and origin of operation - induced reactions are analyzed .    3.2734101328910703
in our opinion , there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation - induced UNK .    3.085837865273354
the beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10 - 15 min .    3.1867084691990226
mri - controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and UNK allows discrimination of operation - induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation .    3.4437800839078836
the tumor is most commonly found in the skin .    3.834066980212523
the cancer is known to cause early and widespread metastases leading to a very poor prognosis of less than 24 months .    3.7648508809394388
the therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation .    2.7688915295543817
background : lipoprotein ( a ) is an important UNK inherited risk factor for coronary disease but there is little data about its distribution in childhood .    3.643078005151089
despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) , no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy .    3.8531287920294734
UNK at several centers are not UNK that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary .    3.3708509873411927
we investigated UNK consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for nsclc including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration .    3.715500144066066
patients were classified into the uicc ( 1987 ) stages i ( n = 115 ) , ii ( n = 42 ) , and iiia ( n = 113 ) .    3.729243350270399
in patients with n1 - positive lymph nodes ( n = 61 ) we found higher 5 - year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration ( 39 % ) than for patients with UNK infiltration ( 21 % ) .    4.091577074136523
patients with n2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases .    3.2440733481481714
due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases , complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for nsclc .    3.204375668044561
the muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control .    3.5535565235642856
this second part of the article will attempt to show not only that the muscles are representing an interesting and sensitive information pool for disorders in the motoric system , but also that lesions in specific leg and hip muscles have an effect on the pelvis and spine and even on scapular mobility .    3.1611387145634415
purpose : the aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease .    2.8614334559513237
methods : from february 1996 to february 1998 , 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure ( abf ) using the transperitoneal approach .    3.09052764116785
six , 5 to 12 mm UNK were needed to dissect , cross - clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices .    2.9125254023085154
the aortic anastomosis was made end - to - side .    3.4568422814203705
a long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision .    3.122040129282363
the distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally .    3.187705574967416
results : the laparoscopic abf was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases .    3.044691101125192
three times a conversion to open surgery was requested .    3.511230751944139
one patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the icu .    2.9458993010448484
mean operative time was 292 + / - 60 min ; the aorta was UNK for 74 + / - 18 min .    3.671910407875294
two patients needed transfusions of red blood cells .    2.764956802729978
in the study group , blood loss averaged UNK + / - UNK ml .    2.8926561157517385
the bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography .    3.684095856520767
the patients were discharged 9 + / - 5 . 8 days after surgery .    3.0801740150987906
at follow - up after 4 . 5 + / - 4 months , 15 patients were examined noninvasively in the vascular laboratory .    3.8650586475352617
all grafts were patent , and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients .    3.6917465588317255
one patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis .    3.6886341309133166
conclusions : the laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible , safe and effective procedure .    2.571114812097376
specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure .    3.405097677940025
the development of vascular UNK and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge .    3.192771408887185
in the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease .    2.8841586488789903
a 12 year old boy developed the complete symptom complex of UNK - UNK ' s disease over a two - year period .    3.858374928754166
he presented with the mucocutaneous variant with recurrent to persistent oral ulcers which extended into the pharynx , recurrent genital ulcers , perianal lesions , and a positive UNK test .    3.4880651968087086
ocular involvement and other symptoms associated with the disease were absent .    3.9465691927943953
however , the early onset of the disease and the male gender indicated a bad prognosis .    3.328407396852705
the patients father deficiency of suffered from bronchial asthma with recurrent respiratory infections .    2.771641946212676
an igg - 3 UNK was detected .    3.341257322358734
lymphocyte transformation tests showed markedly diminished response to stimulation with anti - UNK monoclonal antibody in both patients , while response to UNK , coa and UNK was normal .    3.6815028352365453
in addition , the concentration of serum soluble interleukin 6 receptor was reduced in both patients .    3.0197799485865175
a polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established .    2.8147685062318923
the primers " UNK " and " UNK " amplify a UNK bp fragment within the gene coding for the small UNK subunit ( UNK UNK ) of fungi .    3.6412877600335922
pcr allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds .    3.339382268196253
UNK with specific UNK results in the identification of dermatophytes and candida albicans .    3.780744540548925
restriction analysis of the pcr product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds .    3.818554307602882
the specifity of the pcr with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human dna collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as dna from selected plants and animals .    3.656060177010661
pcr detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive .    3.3534695612114884
sensitivity of pcr ( 92 % ) was higher than that of culture ( 73 % ) .    3.153534684278659
starting with the recommendations of the " psychiatrie - enquête " , a current empirical stock - taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units .    2.9699667320177907
319 treatment units ( 289 in germany , 11 in austria , and 19 in switzerland ) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit , number of wards , centrality of admission , existence of large observation rooms ( " UNK " ) , UNK wards , single sex wards , UNK / sectorization , open - door wards , coercive measures , and intended structural changes .    3.451192324987888
the return rate of questionnaires amounted 59 % .    2.7848691423326284
the results show that the recommendations of the " psychiatrie - enquête " are mostly realized today , but not UNK .    2.885579402216876
across countries differences resulted in size of ward , centrality of admission , open - door wards , and coercive measures .    2.551438136915711
treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission .    2.8604136743995943
differences between psychiatric hospitals , psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were , though significant , smaller than expected in the light of past controversies .    3.171012145517115
intended structural changes mainly concerned open - door wards , internal sectorization , UNK of admission , and mixing the sexes in single sex wards .    3.1912104927119618
background : the ciliary sulcus as the intended location of transsclerally fixated posterior chamber lenses ( pcl ) is withdrawn from the surgeon ' s view .    2.7006661606471583
using high - resolution ultrasound , we acquire pictures that postoperatively allow us to determine the position of the UNK .    3.282327773409765
many patients would like to UNK some sport activities after total knee replacement ; however , most recommendations are based on subjective opinion rather than scientific evidence .    3.332919644117257
background : considering the high recurrence rate after conventional inguinal hernia repair , the totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair has been used .    2.869357231088708
methods : the present experience of the authors UNK UNK patients with a total of UNK inguinal hernias , including 200 recurrences .    3.633703903962916
the operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and UNK .    2.9634747779910184
results : analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow - up reveals a mean ( sem ) operating time of 42 ( 1 . 2 ) min for unilateral and 58 ( 1 . 0 ) min for bilateral hernia repair .    4.066735409280416
mean ( sem ) postoperative hospital stay was 2 ( 0 . 04 ) days .    3.4031137865576064
complication rates during and after operation were 0 . 3 % and 3 . 3 % respectively .    4.673342621653454
the morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3 . 5 % .    3.778323393629596
the recurrence rate was 0 . 3 % at 1 - year follow - up .    3.5970518364064796
conclusion : totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia , even in patients with previous UNK surgery or severe systemic disease .    3.3534516718858254
careful follow - up is mandatory to assess the late recurrence rate .    3.9661465138778023
background : the aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in UNK measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age - related maculopathy ( arm ) , the children of the arm patients ( UNK generation ) and normals .    3.3598854158988876
in approximately 4 - 10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis .    3.5958161449602026
recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease .    3.0154849017776266
although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality , several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions .    3.2544785108813468
however , in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long - term survival of the patients following surgical therapy .    3.6697428992129715
accordingly , the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients .    3.009587569768472
vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction .    3.2144782608193445
in this category , penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients : males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery , maximum of two risk factors , exclusion of diabetes mellitus .    3.5296596479932796
long - term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success .    3.559825871053964
venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the UNK of time after surgery .    3.9377039518850934
long - term success dropped under 40 % , leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation .    3.3128360069292686
in contrast , penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates .    2.794658732342571
despite this , it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the UNK bodies .    4.240201775292121
among numerous types of penile implants , preference is nowadays mostly given to the three - piece hydraulic models .    3.1806523084383187
however , such complications as defective or perforated UNK in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen , depending on the type of implant .    3.5045915884695495
in a selected patient group , vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % ( 50 % to 90 % ) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well - established therapeutical option .    3.2862284314385612
it has been suggested that anhedonia , the loss of UNK , is associated with a dysfunction of the dopaminergic UNK system in schizophrenic and alcohol - dependent patients .    3.1133078136268857
in a series of UNK and brain imaging studies , we examined pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non - human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol - dependent patients .    3.1861676295421644
among alcoholics , we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission , which was associated with the relapse risk , but not with anhedonia or depression .    3.798280758088669
primate studies pointed to the importance of a UNK - cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of UNK dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum .    4.050123352347789
these observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus - dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive UNK , but not with anhedonia .    3.652592126009395
any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease .    3.421419705692675
it is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases ( n2 ) mean a poor prognosis .    2.5885037306134473
therefore , the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low .    2.918203357189015
on the other hand , it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages .    3.003196522722569
in analogy with high - dose contrast - enhanced ct , there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high - dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in mri .    3.6734514820619215
one reason for these studies was the development of new and low - osmolar contrast agents in the mr field .    3.5863761500664704
depending on the clinical problem , a high - dose contrast study in mri is rarely indicated : ( 1 ) in metastatic disease , mr imaging with high - dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery ; ( 2 ) in patients with malignant glioma the high - dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins .    3.768385077529096
if a radical surgical approach is planned , the diagnostic potential should be fully used ; if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned , a standard dose study is enough .    3.0864886712279467
( 3 ) in patients with ms , a high - dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable .    4.261815807227513
the basic idea of the collaborative family health care is nothing new .    2.782077224046774
it has its roots in the bio - psycho - social model of medicine developed by UNK UNK in the u . s . a . and it has a long tradition in the german psychosomatic medicine .    3.64322218884392
at a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note , that collaborative family health care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action - orientation .    2.82212098482577
the basic is a systemic view of illness and health .    2.9095402069342877
the doctor - patient - UNK is in this view enlarged to a treatment - triad composed of the therapist , the patient and his family , to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal , i . e .    3.324435694129565
the treatment motivation of the patient , the support of the family and the UNK of the therapist .    4.731426437473502
however , their realization is not possible without considerable learning processes of physicians , psychotherapists and other professionals .    3.29617016632319
a potential has to be mobilized , which affects by no means only the costs .    3.3581529841097093
the collaborative family health care offers new challenges to the professional culture of psychotherapists and new chances for influencing the world of medical health care .    2.9438562077397807
at a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity , the UNK of cfhc offer a possibility for physicians , patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation .    3.4335756459879967
interested colleagues are invited to UNK in the german section of the cfhc .    4.196939376132756
we evaluated the short - to mid - term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis ( s . t . a . r . ) with uncemented fixation .    3.247643374736531
fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999 .    3.4406730549150897
the initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases ( 62 % ) , primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases ( 16 % ) , and systemic joint affection in 11 cases ( 22 % ) , e . g . rheumatoid arthritis ( 6 cases ) , UNK ( 2 cases ) , psoriasis arthritis ( 1 case ) , lupus UNK ( 1 case ) , and UNK ( 1 case ) .    3.8146611579592262
there were two perioperative complications : one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully , and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction .    2.988733065545786
seven revisions , all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis , were necessary : local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement ( 3 cases ) , posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion ( 2 cases ) , percutaneous lengthening of the achilles tendon ( 1 case ) , and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia ( 1 case ) .    3.3326053097255106
at the last follow - up control , 21 patients ( 62 % ) were very satisfied , 10 patients ( 29 % ) were satisfied , and 3 patients ( 9 % ) were satisfied with reservations .    4.491414711074492
the obtained range of motion was 30 ° ( range , 15 to 55 ° ) , with a maximal plantarflexion of 25 ° ( range , 15 to 45 ° ) and dorsiflexion of 5 ° ( - 3 to 20 ° ) .    3.4401309175364263
when the aofas - hindfoot - score was applied , the 34 patients scored 84 . 1 points ( range , 44 to 100 points ) .    2.921831094802018
after UNK of the implants within 6 weeks , no migration was noted in any case , and all implants were considered to be stable .    4.398545351955175
the favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the s . t . a . r . total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component , e . g . anteroposterior translation , UNK translation and axial rotation .    3.1488190361490154
the success of implantation may depend on exact technique , correct hindfoot alignement , sufficient capsuloligamentous stability of the ankle , and a solid bone stock .    3.5810959919820675
although our first results are very encouraging , a longer follow - up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis .    3.0581466864958005
in a prospective study , the influence of the status of the peri - implant hard and soft tissues on the success of UNK dental implants in tumor patients was assessed .    3.101220942176696
out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants , treated between july 1988 and august 1996 , a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained .    3.040987291724635
eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity .    3.9908941700598497
seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation ( 40 gy ) .    2.9055171169570637
a total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible .    2.9242172945002767
in order to assess the peri - implant hard and soft tissues , the hygiene index , the sulcus bleeding index , the UNK index , the pocket - probing depth , the peri - implant bone resorption , and the UNK were used .    3.3390502074556703
the results in the tumor patients were compared with the results in a pool of nontumor patients .    4.352970709871877
tumor patients had significantly worse peri - implant parameters than nontumor patients .    2.8838284828915244
the peri - implant pocket - probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate .    3.276715487353964
the overall success rate was 77 . 8 % .    2.8400273290655123
many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology , the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques .    3.8213503918296996
this project was set up to develop practical , effective , safe , and easy to run acute pain therapy .    3.0443297873237873
the patient developed a UNK fistula which remained undetected for 1 year .    2.770963892916498
spontaneous fusion of c3 / c4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred .    2.8310642318412773
the fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was UNK removed .    3.675178338670866
the anatomy of the cervical spine , special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed .    4.430289486235804
an UNK block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder .    3.955537535157329
the localisation of the plexus with electro - stimulation and the injection of bupivacain 0 . 5 % were accomplished easily and without painful sensations .    3.405237413662125
48 hours later the block was still partially present .    3.3473479313664254
paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle , but also areas innervated by the median and lateral UNK .    3.2677726120682244
the deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month .    3.0643681813066697
the cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation , toxic action of the injected substance ( bupivacain 0 , 5 % , 30 ml ) , distension of the plexus , a cervical syndrome or an aseptic UNK , although a definite determination is not possible .    3.368337317526227
however , the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty .    3.23079074840323
UNK photography allows documentation of naevi in a map - like fashion .    2.977464068440039
the localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem , as one can scan the film .    3.4338084679131597
comparison of the magnified film with the patient can be done in day - light .    3.462261713549181
magnification up to 48 times is possible .    3.522090908807251
detection of early changes of the naevi , during the horizontal growth phase , should increase the 5 - year survival rate .    3.3701503332498595
in the ancient times , aristotle , UNK , and galen discovered basic anatomical structures .    3.3972234234016856
paul von UNK , in the seventh century a . c . , had the idea of a nerve suture , which was first performed in an animal 1000 years later by the italian surgeon UNK UNK .    3.765310615659131
systematic investigations on nerve crossing date to the beginning of the nineteenth century and were conducted by jean pierre UNK .    2.843497825777258
within 1 week in summer UNK , two french surgeons ( UNK and UNK ) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans .    3.3196060192520926
their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles .    3.0514510762272775
purpose : to analyze the value of electrophysiologic testing according to standards of the international society for clinical UNK of vision ( iscev ) in infants less than 10 years of age .    3.1227693697685397
aggressive angiomyxoma ( aam ) is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences .    3.7028975800555437
the entity was first described in 1983 .    3.5753620962460677
the tumor is regarded as low - grade sarcoma by some authors ; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown .    3.366874774347891
this is a case report on a 27 - year - old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm , initially ( august 1993 ) diagnosed as a UNK .    3.4794096343500254
the patient suffered from recurrences in february 1995 , september 1996 and february 1998 .    2.858654163369576
the diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence .    3.217574199742616
a palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in february 1998 , followed by a radiation therapy with 56 gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the UNK razoxane per os .    3.997413117444903
the single radiation doses were 200 UNK 5 times a week .    2.8574588441865756
the small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable .    3.5770870839989297
a follow - up 2 years after the radiation treatment revealed no recurrence .    3.8752257421603016
the time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures .    3.140911470960357
radiation therapy combined with the UNK razoxane is able to control a recurrent aam for an unknown time .    3.932069251915932
it remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect .    3.1416419207404185
UNK of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications .    3.060850333927213
surgical procedures of external and internal UNK , nerve UNK and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized .    3.317359539143435
with UNK of motor nerves , satisfying or good results can be generally obtained .    3.536919896866209
success rates exceeding 50 % following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures , more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient .    3.397776304903395
perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts , e . g . , by development of minimally invasive , eventually endoscopically guided procedures .    3.0773200861111225
allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied .    4.16886045335287
initial experiments with nerve UNK are encouraging .    3.406766472401267
a better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration .    3.2745102917206124
objective : the acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a UNK of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis .    3.6726915041275268
to determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia , we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia .    3.596704951928586
methods : the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the american college of rheumatology criteria .    3.4244424716577413
urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age - and sex - matched controls .    2.9721377074517874
levels of UNK ( hyp ) , a collagen turnover marker , were also measured .    4.119283404061451
the findings were related to creatinine levels and the pyd / dpyd ratio determined .    2.8848896252955445
the pyd / dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls .    3.250114185220706
analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or , preferably , by hplc analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia .    3.0600954419345348
background : the dynamic radionuclide nephrography ( UNK - UNK ) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract .    4.223305397652831
the aim of the present study was to assess whether UNK nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and UNK induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the UNK - ureteric junction .    2.9313457004427836
we therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout ( 10 - 25 % ) in the presence of normal renal function could UNK a non - operative managment .    4.033115578291848
the lateral decubitus position is the standard position for UNK .    3.6966742139786515
there is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange .    2.9224164906790215
in 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position , we compared a new closed - loop - controlled ventilation algorithm , adaptive lung ventilation ( alv ) , which UNK the breathing pattern automatically , to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation ( cmv ) .    3.60503156220119
the aims of our study were ( 1 ) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange , ( 2 ) to UNK ventilatory parameters selected by the alv controller with traditional settings of cmv , and ( 3 ) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the alv controller .    3.2359769798804
the respirator used was a modified UNK ventilator , which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer .    3.6042014602646817
in a first set of measurements , we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position .    3.100724768933522
in a second set of measurements , patients were ventilated with alv and cmv using a randomized crossover design .    2.8616986895511496
the cmv settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml / kg body weight , a respiratory rate of 10 UNK / min , an i : e ratio of 1 : 1 . 5 , and an end - inspiratory UNK of 30 % of inspiratory time .    3.91898746070047
with both ventilation modes fio2 was set to 0 . 5 and peep to 3 cm h2o .    3.525372800877297
during alv a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml / kg kg - min was preset .    3.35232298090292
all other ventilatory parameters were determined by the alv controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters .    3.620792662890697
positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61 . 6 to 47 . 9 ml / cm h2o ; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1 . 2 to 1 . 08 s , whereas physiological dead space increased from 158 . 9 to 207 . 5 ml .    3.7889784439220953
on average , the ventilatory parameters selected by the alv controller resembled very closely those used with cmv .    2.637918077800441
however , an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with alv .    2.81241142237039
in conclusion , we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease .    3.6771979818180918
the novel alv controller automatically UNK ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of cmv are .    2.959163949043457
noma is an ulcerative - necrotizing UNK - stomatitis eventually leading to severe destruction of the midface , including lips and UNK , maxilla / mandible , nose and rarely the orbit .    3.30047012348523
the defects are usually unilateral .    3.3444554656623504
children from economically UNK countries are predominantly affected .    3.146957381425792
medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate , which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time .    3.793714697545105
predisposing factors include UNK , immunosuppression , and poor oral hygiene .    3.4770321371743984
forty - eight noma patients were surgically treated in UNK , nigeria during october 1997 by an UNK germany team sponsored by UNK UNK UNK .    3.4767920935396255
interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results , e . g . ankylosis release , local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi UNK flaps , as well as a noma classification ( UNK ) , are presented .    3.433005300635797
during a period of 3 years , four UNK clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun - like uv irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions .    3.3499073728811046
the following significant effects were observed .    2.9435440606079526
patients with hypercholesterolaemia : increase of hdl cholesterol after termination of the serial uv irradiation , increase of serum 25 ( oh ) d3 levels , decrease of serum UNK , decrease of serum lactate ; healthy persons : decrease of resting pulse rate , decrease of recovery pulse rate , decrease of systolic blood pressure .    2.6949870520759283
all effects were induced by application of UNK uv doses , i . e .    3.227980618922659
amounts of uv with a relatively low risk of side effects .    3.567755049806416
in 1998 minor et al .    2.753845237683208
described a new variant of UNK fistula : the " superior canal dehiscence syndrome " .    3.381159947955475
this syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and UNK induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure .    2.9821274955738994
it is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior ( anterior ) semicircular canal .    2.820621935349782
due to this dehiscence , a third , mobile window ( in addition to the round and oval windows ) is formed , and changes in pressure are pathologically UNK to the anterior semicircular canal .    3.2707819155481754
in the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability .    2.7600841640783407
we compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with acl - deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects .    3.3673026870458993
both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group .    2.997055303909719
this was true not only for the injured leg but also for the UNK contralateral leg .    3.6278939575296363
the differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s . additionally , the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups .    2.9347347890692848
we were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer , UNK , pivot shift and kt - 1000 measurements .    2.9139281284766594
the study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain - damaged subjects .    3.3688850813420115
116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on - road driving test .    2.9374495396863276
only 58 % of the patients passed the driving test .    3.7195740319287247
attempts to predict the outcome of the driving test by discriminant analysis or cut - off procedures based on neuropsychological and / or other subject - related data yielded a maximum of 73 % correct predictions .    3.3943482464003005
in view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results , it is recommended that in each case an on - road driving test is given .    3.109268040837524
in the planning of laser surgery for ent operations , the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems .    2.9843778933170175
intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser - resistant endotracheal tubes .    3.9554543437152705
the aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ent - related laser surgery .    2.5012573530279223
in a prospective study , 91 patients were included and the UNK - score modified by UNK and young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation .    3.9624568676101193
the results showed a significant correlation ( p < 0 . 05 , chi - square test ) .    2.8053105571894474
however , the specificity was only 72 % and the sensitivity of 60 % was too low to be of practical use .    3.3238232433257027
the results were independent of the endotracheal tube used .    3.4595793852150503
although use of the laser for ent operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist , there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use .    3.6856467572839318
this problem is demonstrated in a literature review .    3.394006017110007
the treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge .    3.240678975288276
we report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to nhl - UNK 95 : block aa protocol .    2.8848156729133145
during his therapy , he developed a thrombosis of his right femoral vein and pulmonary embolism affecting the left segments 4 , 5 , 8 , and 9 .    3.7220750936477076
because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated .    2.9136785865063333
therefore , we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the UNK thrombectomy device .    3.1873436300837814
the postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion ; UNK 4 months UNK showed a patent right femoral vein .    3.014552974748741
within this chapter , tumors which produce bone matrix ( osteoid ) or other bone - forming tissues , like cartilage , connective tissue , and UNK or originate within the bone marrow are described .    3.218546475631224
in addition , those lesions are mentioned which , according to the who , are typical for the UNK and are therefore included within the 1992 who classification of odontogenic tumors .    3.6076631303816438
vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described .    3.765430148242563
all the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance .    3.0173419226882503
a precise diagnosis , therefore , can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field .    3.54183992043042
in addition to clinical , radiological , and histological appearances , therapeutic necessities are described .    2.694571724874214
the data from recent publications are taken into account .    2.8608892941519546
this presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the german - austrian - swiss study group of tumors of the face and jaws ( dösak ) in basel .    3.5244535922852887
between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases .    3.6584737008358363
out of this pool UNK completely documented cases were analysed .    3.0611260072938853
forty - five patients ( 18 % ) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission .    3.5936234075793787
in this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed .    2.977419613800813
in 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration .    3.494050756822948
eight patients were treated without surgery .    3.829932077822341
mortality after liver resection was 4 % , morbidity 28 % .    3.733276331829062
the 5 - year - survival - rate ( kaplan - meier ) of the r0 resected patients ( n = 21 ) was 44 % .    3.5091844461517443
comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease .    3.9216608845034675
survival , morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences .    3.455831965757577
these results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed UNK and with a curative intention .    3.752091795544274
the clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation .    3.807028444982194
eight patients recovered under conservative therapy ; one patient died due to pre - existing , concomitant cardiopulmonary disease .    3.2297284222772333
in three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure .    3.726496170576858
on admission , the transplanted patients had a decreased quick ' s test score and factor v value ( < 10 % ) .    2.681275403082158
the peak of liver enzymes , serum bilirubin , serum creatinine , partial thromboplastin time and UNK were not of any prognostic value .    3.1841244893963334
main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial quick ' s test score and factor v value ( both < 10 % ) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy .    2.9965803748341893
the development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis .    2.9304296264979466
during submaximal UNK back extension loading ( 31 male persons ) surface - emg was measured using 16 monopolar - linked electrodes in the low back region ( l 3 - s 1 ) .    3.00499362328512
by means of modification of amplitude - and frequency parameters in the emg - signal two subject groups ( 6 persons each ) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the UNK region were defined .    3.369035024693882
during the extension phase , the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning .    3.2897490004652097
in contrast to this , the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability .    3.3916604518961413
therefore , in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function .    3.4151153849166005
background : a UNK flow reserve ( ffrmyo ) < 0 . 75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function .    3.7490312076843724
we used the ffrmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and / or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the lad for decision to ptca and checked the indication by clinical follow - up .    3.336225489658377
distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia .    3.838149545253856
usually , a non - continuous distraction mode is applied .    3.420705276819181
the aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder .    2.4653765126228184
the hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic UNK UNK system .    3.2366418624741415
following 7 days at rest , a continuous distraction of 1 . 5 mm per day was performed for 14 days .    3.8647940383165924
after 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively , the animals were killed and x - rays taken .    3.652805133244365
the mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed .    3.4588349016959765
the microhydraulic cylinder was easy to apply and to handle .    3.1290234904454524
the continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles .    2.6384174969564818
bony regeneration seems to be accelerated , which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase .    3.778550798135467
when UNK is used , the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration .    3.377897959171419
for bupivacaine , however , the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear .    4.535563129458337
we investigated the effects of epinephrine 1 : 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0 . 5 % on duration and haemodynamics .    3.2179722318070008
ten former pre - term infants with postnatal respiratory problems , scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair , were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained .    3.2154195915136645
the infants were UNK at least 4 h prior to surgery .    3.143899552879068
if they did not receive i . v .    2.9858496184208794
infusions before surgery , a bolus of 10 ml / kg UNK ' s acetate was injected after inserting the i . v .    3.509694140108578
cannula , followed by a continuous infusion of 8 ml / kg 2 / 3 n nacl with 5 % UNK .    3.7173799028015613
spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0 . 6 ml bupivacaine 0 . 5 % .    3.8888968813185048
five patients received plain bupivacaine ( group i ) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 : 200 000 ( group ii ) .    2.854818955127072
heart rate registered by ecg and non - invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2 , 5 , 10 , and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine .    3.328525374687987
the duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation .    3.5516947700895307
for testing statistical differences the u test was used between the groups and the wilcoxon and UNK test within the groups .    3.4105864446529424
results ( expressed as median and range ) .    3.0736728240930797
additional epinephrine significantly prolonged the duration of spinal anaesthesia ( group ii : 95 min [ 60 - 120 ] vs group i : 50 min [ 37 - 85 ] ) .    3.1761607082168006
haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups .    3.4370155712285597
in group i , one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects ; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask , sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned .    2.821085028393037
the duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min .    2.784861666639396
epinephrine 1 : 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants .    2.7895460773898444
haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine .    3.430404541380574
purpose : debate about the potential implementation of spiral - ct in diagnostic algorithms of pulmonary embolism are often focussed on sensitivity and specificity in the context of comparative methodologic studies .    3.1889170137852436
we UNK to investigate whether additional factors might influence this debate .    3.414531865915832
familial dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) should be an " evidence - based " diagnosis derived from clinical and echocardiographic screening of informed and UNK relatives of index patients , and on the examination of clinical reports for deceased relatives .    3.5460631127992213
most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance .    3.179623596890711
very few of them are x - linked and UNK .    3.410669883032791
autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence - based setting .    3.433149529453189
by linkage analysis , several loci , but no disease gene , have been identified .    3.6494688075869806
at present , few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis .    3.0249890225632377
as the results of the structural reform policy regulating the health care sector , the paper presents the possible path of increasing UNK risk selection and UNK risk externalization ( especially between the law of health care insurance , the law of statutory nursing UNK , and the german UNK law ) .    3.569361498063897
particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be UNK regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization .    3.68971378058878
the new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law , especially more developed networks of the health care , the nursing system , and the social care services .    3.6924604619349437
purpose : the inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours .    2.7566689823909014
purpose of this study was to UNK the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma , metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology .    3.1494584198070643
introduction : the hemodynamic parameters of 95 patients undergoing maxillary or bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in 1996 and 1997 at the department of UNK surgery / plastic surgery , krefeld , germany , were analyzed retrospectivly to study the effect of intraoperative blood loss .    3.2027724390464845
materials and methods : the parameters included the blood loss volume , age , weight and sex of the patients , the mode of osteotomy and the operation time , the surgeon , the average blood pressure , the infusion volume , the anesthesiologist , the thrombocyte counts and their function , the activity of the coagulation factors ii , v , vii , viii , ix , x , xi , UNK , UNK and von - willebrand - factor , and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient , the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion .    4.034930792106985
statistical analysis was done using the UNK - UNK - test .    4.313749799618199
results : the average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was 670 + / - 380 ml and during bimaxillary surgery UNK + / - UNK ml .    3.255003086068434
men lost about 300 ml more than women .    3.1060238084957965
the average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and UNK ml of various anesthesiologists between UNK ml and 1200 ml , without statistical evidence .    2.8760483958601344
some 17 . 9 % of patients showed pathological UNK function concerning medication with aspirin ; 34 . 7 % had pathological activities of coagulation factors , but only 2 . 1 % with clinical significance .    4.06044294157217
conclusion : mode of operation , maxillary or bimaxillary , und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss .    3.00951360366131
patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation .    3.269155496659606
in most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin .    3.1703222742039197
analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery .    3.764964515169634
maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14 . 2 % of autologous blood unit .    4.158647283696267
this should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs .    2.8243752474519113
purpose : course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied .    3.044849551797316
wells ' syndrome ( eosinophilic cellulitis ) is a rare inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology and pathogenesis .    3.646046296903353
only 18 cases in childhood have been reported .    3.337938988249312
we report on a 5 - year - old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease : initially edematous - UNK lesions associated with blisters , followed by morphea - like changes on the extremities .    3.080423007454732
eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent , which , however , was not correlated with the severity of the current condition .    4.726684724674873
trigger factors or systemic hematologic malignancy could not be detected .    3.4693833749542153
in 1996 , several employees of the french governmental organization for blood collection and transfusions ( UNK ) have been UNK by ordinary courts .    3.5918696692999705
they were found guilty in the UNK on hiv - infected blood transfusions .    3.9885026593907846
over 3800 persons , mostly hemophiliacs , have been infected in france and suffer from hiv disease .    3.1407607684809524
the public in france urgently demanded the UNK of the persons who were UNK responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of hiv - tests for blood UNK in france .    4.157601223556642
such a test was available from the american company abbott in the early 1985 , but the french authorities preferred to wait for the hiv - test from UNK - diagnostics .    3.4648779591607255
a special court , the " court de justice de la UNK " , authorized to judge on members of the UNK , has been created by the french UNK on UNK . 23 , 1993 .    3.781591978316695
six years later , the three politicians , the former prime minister laurent fabius , the minister for social affairs , UNK UNK dufoix , and her UNK of state for health , mr . edmond hervé , have been accused of involuntary homicide .    2.936254112152252
march , 9 , 1999 , after five weeks of UNK and statements , the UNK UNK his UNK : the former prime minister laurent fabius and the minister g . dufoix were discharged , but the UNK of state for health , edmond hervé , has been declared guilty .    3.7245627710503046
however , also mr . hervé could leave the court room as a free person , because the president of the court , mr . christian le UNK , UNK ' t want to UNK a judgement against him , as mr . hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public critics and attacks before he was found guilty .    3.1672562567590696
the hemophiliacs and other aids - patients as well as their families UNK UNK against this judgement .    3.6022300166281185
they plan to file charges against the three UNK through a common court to hold them responsible .    3.0609576587680647
classical insight therapy , derived from freud , and ` maternal ' holding therapy , derived from UNK , winnicott and others , are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis .    2.9403619061844957
the authors believe that each of these two techniques UNK specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings .    3.42599383644484
the position of freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience .    3.28215114906855
the contra - position of the object relation psychologists UNK the priority of love in human experience .    3.062723352102773
these assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and UNK have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy .    3.434896796353099
UNK hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations .    2.9810339063792806
we report a case of a 34 - year old male with single ventricle , two atria , tricuspid atresia , large atrial septal defect , complete transposition and pulmonary UNK stenosis .    3.0322432158480495
intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years .    4.5014726729564085
conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation .    3.7381137099124637
the patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession , family and some UNK activities like UNK .    3.017608421012597
he died of sudden cardiac death .    3.2998942015254378
the malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development .    3.5226474600524447
clinical picture , prognosis and therapy are reported from literature .    3.784856317165615
during the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results .    2.8897008471226875
special morphologic constellations , as in our case , may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life .    3.8515276495690385
the assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies .    3.5767673037532353
the measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age , cognitive level , psychological status , intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child ' s individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation .    3.8309309008716848
from its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional , material and morphological changes that are UNK .    3.1403496021482415
these changes permit classifying an individual as young , adult , old , active or UNK .    2.8150073120899237
but this estimation is not always correct .    3.763045800199119
some appear younger , some older than expected from their UNK age .    3.305806031078083
but what is ageing and how can it be measured ?    3.1125758203351293
for this , so - called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms .    3.020541234613137
a description of the complexity , the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi - factorial measuring system , in a so - called test battery .    3.699583680811705
various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans , mental and also social parameters in different combinations .    3.110532940973764
a more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ilse study .    4.035248110665892
the documentation form for pathohistologic findings ( version iii ) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented .    3.2819653675534743
it is part of the site - specific documentation of the german association of tumor centers ( UNK ) .    3.9178803191371316
its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the icd - o classification and the tnm system .    3.5660547815178134
the prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer .    2.72939047729355
by means of a multicentric observational study the german austrian swiss co - operative group dösak will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer .    2.6740094251038196
the development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium .    3.0857652451286186
to analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia , we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) , transforming growth factor - alpha ( tgf - ) , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , epidermal growth factor - receptor ( egf - r ) , the proliferation marker mib 1 , c - myc proto - oncogene product and activation marker UNK .    3.246311208437923
results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells .    3.191007180306138
middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for tgf - alpha , egf - r , il - 1 and c - myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix .    3.1138254336964715
the local release of cytokines and growth factors , such as tgf - alpha , egf and il - 1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the UNK behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium .    3.436282313378048
our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa .    3.5631823122647486
the role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter .    3.273325489798548
this paper reports the results of the austrian ultrasound hip screening program , in which all austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice : at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12 - 16 weeks .    3.393149969511455
data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all icd data about children hospitalized because of cdh in austria were collected and analyzed .    2.7894077781534516
the treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13 . 16 % ( 1985 ) .    3.212611533711435
the rate of open reduction went down to 0 . 24 per 1000 newborns , including a high number of UNK children born abroad and also children with UNK dislocation of the hip .    3.59987219837355
hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia .    4.615838894420567
the optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only " high risk " hips ( clinical instability , positive family history , breech delivery ) should undergo hip sonography , but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature .    3.051055721776205
since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening , a further reduction of costs could be accomplished .    3.6821457110364455
disability owing to ddh can be avoided in a number of cases , and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be UNK .    4.123274506212021
transactional analysis ( UNK 1958 ) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes .    3.0319556007287063
this intention lead some of the following authors to UNK and a " happy - go - lucky " perspective .    3.9229923385075223
others , most of all european transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances .    3.7323145663751025
this article will illustrate these aspects , using the borderline syndrome as an example .    3.2628175449641623
the structural model of UNK serves to describe the borderline structure , concepts of the frame of reference and the UNK as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology , the concepts of transactions , games , UNK and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships , and UNK and UNK as examples of defence patterns .    4.079210764240996
practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working UNK , about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes , and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences , a healing UNK and UNK of the process follow .    3.4295191518792096
the article ends with transactional analytic considerations of transference , counter - transference and how to deal with regression processes .    2.7000354051324433
after separation of UNK in ocular pemphigoid , transplantation of nasal or UNK mucosa is recommended to prevent recurrent lid fusion ; however , it is not always successful .    3.6161472635075578
the disturbance of generalized UNK ( UNK - UNK disorder ) is an illness , which is often recognised very late .    4.65826816947757
it is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness , UNK , great anxiety , self - UNK or aggression directed against others .    3.521969284069414
early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life - quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long - term consequences .    4.138434296636361
disturbances of microcirculation in coronary artery disease can be seen in the presence of critical stenosis of epicardial coronary arteries , as a result of endothelial dysfunction in the absence of significant stenosis or during recovery of ischaemic myocardium after successful angioplasty of UNK or occluded coronary arteries .    4.019977950312296
diagnostic methods are morphologic / morphometric analyses , measurement of the global coronary reserve , measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation ( scintigraphy , positron emission tomography ) and laboratory analysis of UNK alterations ( plasma , UNK , leucocytes ) .    3.5003618120292606
after successful angioplasty , normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months .    2.518529026324362
in patients with unstable angina , changes in plasma viscosity , erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur .    2.941469197838158
UNK are activated after successful angioplasty in acute myocardial infarction and even after elective angioplasty ( when measured in the coronary sinus ) .    3.3183564661847074
therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure ( by revascularisation , nitrates , calcium UNK , physical training ) , by improving the UNK of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance ( by antihypertensive treatment ) .    3.481556639253468
intracytoplasmic injection of sperm ( icsi ) extracted from testicular tissue ( tese ) represents the only possibility for men with non - obstructive azoospermia to father a child .    2.9008468989841343
icsi is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful .    3.6800009873989032
however , approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy .    3.266222020160933
thus , in most cases , several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times .    3.7484562036862448
cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) and to UNK surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman ( ovarian stimulation , ovum pick - up , embryo transfer ) .    3.195334987564346
for the man , cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval .    3.356731100269012
the advantage for the women is that infertility treatment is started only if testicular histology confirms UNK , at least in the testicular tissue .    2.974782563161388
the cumulative pregnancy rate of ivf / icsi / tese - cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after UNK in successive cycles .    2.7054590606284052
this study gives a survey of the publications of articles about the care of the newborn around UNK .    2.9805805685062627
a main paediatric and obstetric journal ( archiv für UNK , archiv für UNK ) from the turn of the century were analysed including the years UNK - 1910 .    2.8257009774426143
purpose : to compare electron beam ct ( ebct ) und prospectively ecg gated conventional ct for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcifications .    3.322581776976416
in europe , saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery .    2.604803078116046
the incidence amounts to 0 . 4 % among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases .    4.002081806428179
concerning this review , the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996 .    3.8307438427790133
preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult .    3.013131428324505
the majority of patients ( 77 % ) are male .    3.1538267207165895
there is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand .    3.25693792694462
a higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in UNK , in the building trade , and in paper UNK .    4.025234190628388
pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47 % of the patients .    3.718730715526666
usually , the tentative diagnosis is based on chest x - ray , especially if hemoptysis is present .    3.4902071787246274
major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma .    3.428984249527323
clinical presentation and chest x - ray findings are non - characteristic .    3.0991893938126265
nowadays , the typical x - ray of pulmonary aspergilloma , almost always localized in the upper lobes , became a rare finding .    3.5739328639601284
if an UNK infection is suspected , serologic methods are reliable and sensitive .    3.2487225490268807
a surgical procedure is UNK indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history , in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination .    4.03590832578605
if a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings , clinical examination , and patient ' s social history , an operation is justified .    3.461711391743633
relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the UNK .    3.6463795769784704
the lobectomy , if necessary carried out as UNK - lobectomy , is the adequate resection in most patients ( 68 % ) .    3.6937918482092074
however , this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases .    3.095493963720378
peri - and postoperative complications occur in 60 % of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma .    3.7104078759780332
a higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections , like UNK or wedge resections , as compared to lobectomies .    3.3850716933109735
persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem .    3.647906715944862
it requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients .    3.5956271158308235
the operative mortality rate is 3 % .    3.157205796752557
a systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications .    3.268620307021906
introduction : postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course .    3.211110936224213
these patients ' recovery takes longer .    2.966425845563317
in this study we analyze the incidence of postoperative delirium in patients undergoing vascular surgery and try to identify risk factors for its development .    3.2405905297657074
methods : patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included .    2.9735307142639402
their medical history , the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed , the medication and laboratory data were monitored .    3.5380857858788457
additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist .    3.8353697286915573
intraoperatively the drugs , infusions , possible transfusions , blood gases and pressures were monitored , as were the times of surgery and anesthesia .    3.319395364171028
postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days .    3.299659973384776
postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to dsm iv criteria , and mild , moderate and severe delirium were distinguished .    3.120804421809441
results : fifty - four patients entered the study .    3.0885588511845383
twenty - one ( 38 . 9 % ) developed postoperative delirium ( 11 mild , 2 moderate , 8 severe ) .    3.2223141831406017
patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non - aortic procedures ( 55 . 5 vs 22 . 2 % , n = 27 each ) .    3.7731385721717436
some preexisting diseases ( hearing disturbance ) increased the probability of postoperative delirium , while age was not identified as a risk factor .    3.4067447570539424
general psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium .    3.083633271280657
patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently .    3.2242755223862245
this was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases , which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium .    3.3546255175617032
more reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for UNK volume , intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values ( hb < 10 g / dl ) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated .    3.8576246703105754
patients with delirium had serious complications more often ( 8 / 21 = 38 . 1 % vs 6 / 33 = 18 . 2 % ) and needed intensive care treatment longer ( 2 . 7 vs 2 . 1 days , only aortic surgery 3 . 2 vs 2 . 4 days ) .    3.882624137538989
conclusions : postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent .    3.1862830120103753
patients undergoing aortic surgery , with specific concomittant medical disease , psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course , are at risk of developing postoperative delirium .    3.154328274701132
this report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical ( svv ) as a clinical neuro - UNK tool .    3.4438782605098894
in the svv test , patients have to UNK a UNK light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth - vertical , using a remote - control .    3.47775118025767
normal subjects in an upright position did not UNK more than 2 ° from true vertical .    3.4295173978734033
after vestibular neurectomy , the svv was consistently tilted by some 12 ° toward the affected ear .    2.9818441353629956
smaller UNK ( ~ 7 ° ) of the svv occured in patients with spontaneous peripheral vestibular diseases .    4.310552574290101
this shift in svv disappeared within weeks to months , similar to the spontaneous nystagmus .    3.2218448819475283
after stapes surgery slight deviations of the svv towards the UNK ear were seen in about 20 % of the patients , indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs .    3.4070545688790483
assessed in an upright position , the svv thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic UNK input differences between the two ears .    3.6641069595855154
introduction : vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery .    2.86993822396137
a prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma .    3.4436323420680526
patients and methods : two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre - and postoperatively after short - term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region .    3.328767644125875
we noted the inner diameter of the tube , intubation problems , the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient .    3.3927437475993405
results : preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1 . 9 % of cases .    3.0632342761319356
postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients ( 6 . 2 % ) .    3.151374284689693
in 10 patients a direct lesion ( oedema , rubor , haematoma , granuloma ) was established .    2.866064659176793
three patients ( 1 . 4 % ) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings , leading to UNK ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months .    3.699108490104069
conclusion : the frequency of intubation - related recurrent nerve palsy is 1 . 4 % transiently and 0 . 5 % permanently .    3.9564347640067177
preoperative UNK investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation .    3.4155941363409608
herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv - 1 ) and type 2 ( hsv - 2 ) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations .    3.877210639087509
this study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors ( 1979 samples ) and hospital patients ( UNK samples ) without risk factors for UNK infections such as std , other infectious diseases and immunosuppression .    3.0644044897857845
serum samples were tested with UNK using monoclonal antibody - selected native UNK and UNK as antigens and an UNK using type - specific recombinant glycoproteins .    3.668780126717506
equivocal results were confirmed with an in - house western UNK .    3.391496037547661
this study investigates the effects of UNK , a glutamatergic modulator , and the lipid peroxidation inhibitor u - UNK on neurological outcome following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats .    3.488213282028451
we report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant hailey - hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder .    2.3148354378601534
as molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple mendelian traits possible as a routine task , the gene for hailey - hailey disease will presumably be localized in the UNK future .    3.2266205232335663
the hailey - hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder .    2.8550318754244834
background : osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men .    2.910796251572735
epidemiologic data from germany indicate that more than 900 , 000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures .    2.771846786246173
diagnosis and therapy of male osteoporosis are hampered by a lack of clinical studies .    3.489816362978113
recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain ( rap ) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood : the prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20 - 50 % , of migraine to 5 - 7 % and of rap to 15 - 30 % .    3.4843341286478977
in nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life - span .    2.4924911115090977
the unfavourable long - term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions .    3.0347871447823955
empirical findings on the etiology , pathogenesis , and pathophysiology are still very limited .    2.7611985626832496
actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance , and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences .    2.7914717630947714
the behavioral - medicine UNK bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis .    2.788027960199483
the psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis ( stress inoculation , cognitive UNK , problem solving ) , reduction of pain symptoms ( relaxation , distraction , imagination ) and environmental modification ( parental reinforcement and UNK behavior ) .    2.6804023805289456
during the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children .    2.2338956696268615
the aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases .    2.8005231194794735
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( eswl ) is standard therapy for urolithiasis .    2.5528657030298234
with comparable technical principles , various UNK have been developed and are in routine use .    3.4198920481692765
renal pelvic stones , UNK stones , ureteral stones , and other special forms can be treated with varying results .    3.3421196920502902
currently , the so - called clinically UNK residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion .    2.99679207816556
whereas the side effects of eswl are well known , studies comparing eswl with other UNK procedures are still lacking .    3.3275930649717607
suramin has long been used in the treatment of UNK and UNK .    3.846286549713167
recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines .    2.6957012618508798
ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma .    3.856274391714808
five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high - dose suramin .    3.6817260416553577
four of the five developed a UNK or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy .    3.6368169896905758
the rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days .    3.2250504913973073
in tumour therapy , high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg / ml .    3.4926765966603175
therefore , a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes .    3.069629794251356
UNK ( ace ) inhibitor - induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema .    3.12078891259399
between january 1 , 1993 and february 1 , 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation .    3.2009254403577105
the most common reason was an ace - inhibitor - induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases , all of whom required inpatient treatment .    2.8233816965701743
the medical management consisted of the UNK - tion of intravenous ( i . v . )    3.7525589509119737
glucocorticosteroids in all cases , h1 - blockers in 6 cases , epinephrine by inhalation in one case and i . v .    3.5674658841417535
tracheostomy had to be performed in one patient .    4.335995691787242
in our experience it is necessary to reconsider ace inhibitor - induced UNK in any case of an oropharyngeal edema .    3.3870764673831175
however , there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases .    3.406348618530406
after treatment of more than 3000 kidney and ureteral stones with the siemens lithostar multiline the results of the first UNK ureteral stone treatments using the " booster technique " and 3 - month follow - up findings are reported .    3.6549041635460804
there was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment ; 1 week after " booster technique " treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms .    2.999792586109157
only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary , 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( eswl ) and 6 % after eswl .    3.151918242807201
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication , anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia .    4.451959103369326
our data even prove that in situ eswl is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones .    3.1000250781194607
in comparison to endoscopic procedures , it is superior in regard to invasivity , side effects , complications and UNK of analgesia , while being just as efficient .    4.047100189709439
therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones .    3.3429449521097983
the perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss ( snhl ) .    2.8409305078699734
the majority of patients with snhl suffer from a cochlea amplifier ( ca ) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions ( UNK ) .    2.850767770987969
therefore , the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the ca .    2.9259356312529716
thus , the implant is thought to function as a cai ( cochlea amplifier implant ) .    3.024778812092486
an approved implant for routine use is not yet available .    3.687630873300604
clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming ( hec ) , narrow - band , electromagnetic floating - mass transducer , as well as the UNK - hec implant .    3.1221429847701603
of the piezoelectrical implants , a german cai ( tübingen implant ) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient .    2.9038656912381393
it is a low energy consuming ( UNK ) , broad - band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss .    3.59961220041186
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( jme ) was de - scribed UNK by UNK and christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic UNK in varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic - clonic seizures , a typical circadian distribution on awakening , sleep deprivation , alcohol consumption and UNK stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors , typical eeg abnormalities with generalized UNK discharges , normal physical and neuroradiological findings , and often a family history of epilepsy .    3.0230773058980707
although the misdiagnosis of this well - classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in germany , we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit .    3.315489735535837
between 1993 and 1995 , 30 patients with a typical jme - like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially .    3.6143456847360884
all patients reported the typical circadian distribution , abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent , and typical eeg abnormalities were present in all cases .    3.1908819113159765
under treatment with UNK antiepileptic drugs 97 % of the patients became almost completely seizure - free .    3.9021012003764994
even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome , jme is an underdiagnosed illness .    3.988225721905137
the generally positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification .    3.4062847182070106
background : the aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and UNK and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag - fixated iol implantation in children .    2.9442566345694403
arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease .    3.37200515940577
previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the UNK microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension .    4.633383316307313
during follow - up a progression of these alterations has been reported .    3.397220182964537
in the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication .    3.062970616516159
vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology .    3.445015235364163
the cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin .    3.179202053767331
first , the basic circulation parameters should be determined .    2.9357344317328673
blood volume and oxygen substitution are essential .    3.4890046347516503
depending on these findings , further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken .    3.2470439876335075
if the situation is stable , diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor .    3.2684598765567627
a general examination , including a vaginal and rectal examination , must be performed .    3.4195734034276732
other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound ( vaginal and transabdominal ) and ct or mri may be required .    3.0837687150786866
if available , an angiography should be performed .    3.3211245826286224
medium - term results with a follow - up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients ( average follow up 51 months ) after acl reconstruction using ikdc evaluation form and noyes score and in 110 patients ( average follow up 53 months ) after non - operative management .    3.8437595290742816
unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with acl reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery .    3.789269613771055
the best functional results we found in professional athletes after acl reconstruction .    3.17373507046433
comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx .    3.4354470980572933
15 % of the patients from the natural history group , who can maintain high risk pivoting activity level feeling no giving way .    3.5868568994957273
in our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the UNK results in these two groups of patients .    3.66940277284568
it will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of UNK that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability .    3.2945919188251467
we have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the acl - deficient knee .    3.4458668930266683
the pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability .    2.9242896459842638
in our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical UNK .    3.0835913298631032
multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem .    3.8780142173984067
the present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more .    3.1573863759878766
a total of UNK multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score ( iss ) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups : y : 16 - 64 years , n = UNK ; o : 65 - 94 years , n = 132 .    3.462556382845094
older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases ( 69 % ) , while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers ( 41 % ) .    3.605519147795235
iss was comparable in both groups ( y 28 + / - 1 , o 27 + / - 1 ) .    4.015405786995569
during icu - therapy incidence of ards ( y 10 % , o 11 % ) , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mof ; y 6 % , o 9 % ) and pneumonia ( y 17 % , o 21 % ) were comparable .    4.104809938861001
in contrast , septic complications were more frequent in older patients ( y 19 % , o 27 % ) .    3.1397461700224945
length of icu stay ( y 19 + / - 2 , o 18 + / - 1 ) and ventilation time ( y 14 + / - 2 , o 17 + / - 1 ) were comparable .    3.8786486274503518
mortality was significantly higher in older patients ( y 15 % , o 53 % ) .    3.5534513329772994
in conclusion , older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of UNK complications .    4.018367168861162
the raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90 - 100 % of patients with systemic scleroderma .    4.1081870907402935
it is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between UNK and vasodilatory influences .    3.3621564587087276
early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances .    3.780896809143912
structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm .    3.236956445378055
new vasodilatory treatment strategies , e . g .    2.7827282444461083
infusions with calcitonin gene - related peptides , could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma .    3.9061552129321875
due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence , strong efforts were made to find non - pharmacological strategies .    3.255935682011258
for three years now , the implantable atrial defibrillator metrix from UNK has been available as an alternative therapy .    3.1166035911556067
from october 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide .    3.3562334233240936
the sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90 % ; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100 % .    3.2371803232143908
in 121 of 179 patients , UNK episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2 . 4 shocks per episode .    3.6221626678111405
no proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen .    3.0275010047362287
a cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95 % of patients ; the overall clinical success rate was 88 % .    4.0442297903102915
in 7 % of all patients , early recurrence of atrial fibrillation ( UNK ) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further UNK and antiarrhythmic therapy .    4.2187960079314735
in 8 patients , postoperative complications were seen ( infections , pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein ) .    3.496726895164604
overall , the implantable atrial defibrillator metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation .    2.9498182453411292
background : the success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established .    3.325721117523066
the somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults .    2.663921338078544
these differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest .    3.2993791737047378
maturation of a - and c - fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat .    3.2851675484091976
in early stages of development there is no definite spatial UNK in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non - nociceptive system .    3.6707692103172653
in preterms but not in adults non - noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization .    3.090612207505494
many neurotransmitters and UNK molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period .    3.0971669477333124
more important , receptors are frequently transiently UNK or expressed in areas during development where they are not seen in the adult and may have a different functional profile .    3.5253580604181347
the descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system .    2.969782946720804
thus , during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable .    3.26311634319611
for example , neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later .    3.0258174908075106
numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public ' s attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly UNK .    3.095239979617657
since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community - based psychiatric care , we must ask how public opinion might be influenced .    3.053155405690652
one possible approach could be through so - called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area .    3.287191499100648
doctors belong to this group of people .    3.7315653705824543
for this reason we questioned medical students , as future key community leaders , with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies .    2.873632587311116
in order to make a direct comparison possible , we interviewed a sample of the mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up .    3.049331955929828
the comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill ; in fact , in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has .    2.9215153933480913
we were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes .    3.0315966425989065
systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor ' s drainage basin .    3.024963851133643
this requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes .    3.016496369298071
systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging .    3.507491278722486
an intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging .    3.164612393879216
recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure - related complications .    3.6030273209384975
life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often , as a result of tumour infiltration , postoperative anatomical changes , infection and radiological necrosis , difficult to control .    3.76781083699553
one option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external ( eca ) or common carotid artery ( cca ) and superior thyroid artery ( sta ) .    3.268238086614213
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure .    4.458328861094456
the external carotid artery ( eca ) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients .    3.2876444563771545
there was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the eca .    2.724291044374062
one patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation .    3.0240497593445363
in 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients , in whom ligature of the cca or eca and sta respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure , severe neurological complications up to an UNK syndrome occured .    3.3816501628044597
the number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the eca performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection .    3.041321276260124
in addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the eca than observed after UNK the cca or eca and sta in an emergency situation .    2.91876501180202
the carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity .    3.552689256611004
typical , however , is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy .    3.7149274260252847
as the tumor is very rare , there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor .    3.690909586469048
therefore , a review of the literature was performed .    2.996764075073032
we report about a 28 - year - old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity .    2.8499596810243073
without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection .    3.3746403981896385
as treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow - up on a regular basis .    4.180541092780828
intraoperative precision in computer - assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system , the precision of correlation between object and data set , the position , number and fixation of landmarks , and the parameters of the data set .    3.7563345283544427
the characteristics of a navigation system , in particular the immanent precision , can be detected by the use of the geometric model and navigation analyzer developed at the university of UNK with the support of carl zeiss , germany .    3.47289370211754
the precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured : viewing UNK ( UNK , mechanical system ) , the UNK microscope ( carl zeiss , infrared system with laser autofocus ) , the UNK system ( carl zeiss , robot platform with laser autofocus ) and the UNK pointer ( UNK , infrared system ) .    4.074127651713101
the immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0 . 1 to 2 . 0 mm .    4.423373728208059
the application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed .    2.9612723994920924
the aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of pneumocystis carinii - pneumonia ( pcp ) among hiv - infected children ( < 18 years ) in germany .    2.754378082070508
the patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis , course of disease and prognosis .    4.300567169893184
in this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes .    3.1769195221054947
these agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels ; in particular they reduce the osteoblast ' s synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix .    2.850802715853764
they also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations , particularly in men and postmenopausal women .    3.085863943349696
gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) , which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract , have not yet been fully investigated .    3.3469188387967916
between 1994 and 1998 , 18 gist patients UNK operation in the department of surgery .    3.044536872751144
twelve of these patients ( 67 % ) had stromal tumors in the stomach , and six ( 33 % ) had intestinal stromal tumors .    3.733560628483721
the primary tumor could be removed in all patients with r0 resection .    4.0766704371858475
six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis , with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm .    3.5515652072580894
extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case .    3.4651587122344383
lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur .    3.5412037639693064
histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of UNK , UNK and UNK .    3.4849047249539535
currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases .    4.1753137401257945
adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed .    3.207917191701995
acute UNK in europe ( UNK ' s disease ) is a rare and in more than 90 % of the cases undiagnosed febrile , self - limited disease .    3.792513791531845
we report the case of a 39 - year - old UNK worker , who was admitted to our hospital with fever , jaundice , pain in his UNK and acute renal failure .    2.807616314631381
serology revealed elevated antibody titers against UNK UNK , l . UNK and l . UNK .    4.056923832836038
the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia .    2.631123561708377
the ecg showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm .    2.903642107198741
cardiac arrest developed , most likely due to hypoxia , with a drop in the blood pressure .    3.795808522785716
despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later .    3.126790308212948
autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized UNK infection , signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient .    3.31501414821829
the virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic UNK and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue .    2.925969853190708
a medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given , the disease being recognized as an occupational disease .    3.09674634207252
during the past decade , the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression , including metastasis and angiogenesis , have become better understood .    3.1898689727819907
cancer metastasis consists of multiple , complex interacting steps .    3.2907796260841566
each of these steps is crucial and limiting , since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis .    2.9647545495858374
detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood - and lymph vessels .    2.911110672396313
the intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors , which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels .    3.157374534627968
adhesion to endothelial cells , extravasation from the circulation , and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for UNK the metastatic process .    3.455658297266809
furthermore , it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation , it will survive only by UNK of the immune system .    3.4427833606040807
the systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for UNK approaches .    2.8244754333360604
hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male .    3.2405591674932825
the choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible .    3.2055541042488738
to date , transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male .    2.7705635808000877
future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate .    2.8890557534855934
any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely , especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate .    3.4885127255959083
pigmented UNK synovitis ( pvns ) is a disease that involves the lining of joints , UNK and tendon sheaths .    4.06988710339911
the incidence is low and estimated to be 1 . 8 patients per million population .    3.476531286069604
the cause of pvns is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic .    3.1350917140749512
pvns has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment ( nodular and diffuse ) .    3.596273493042356
the articular form almost UNK in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year - old patient .    3.9993448909196965
in this retrospective study , 13 patients with subtle lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment , radiography and dynamic UNK gait analysis .    2.8683034698797747
the aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity , evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries , and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention .    3.270091179985245
all patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity , increased motion in the subtalar joint , increased load on the hindfoot , decreased load on the forefoot , and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase .    3.196657248765366
radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial lisfranc joint .    3.7465150771121856
an unstable medial lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot .    4.178017218408929
initial treatment of a UNK displaced lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot .    3.4235968362541547
after failed initial treatment , early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot .    3.4390557221521636
cross - sectional imaging with ct and mri plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms .    2.9222626072915463
adequate interpretation of the ct and mr images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and UNK with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality .    3.8669395850430206
in addition , the radiologist should be aware of the implications of imaging for staging and treatment .    2.7371375845174137
both ct and mr imaging are highly sensitive for the detection of neoplastic invasion of the pre - epiglottic space , UNK space , UNK region and cartilage .    3.834314128771286
the high negative predictive value of both ct and mri allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably .    3.1184865669716912
the specificity of both ct and mri is , however , limited and both methods may therefore UNK the extent of tumor spread .    3.7102060208880934
nevertheless , both cross - sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy .    3.2436151285980226
in the presence of a submucosal mass , ct and mri play a key role for the diagnosis , as they may characterize the lesion , reliably depict its submucosal extent , and guide the UNK to perform deep biopsies that allow a definitive histological diagnosis .    3.521352656794491
background : hla - dr antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology .    2.74773702429337
organ culture storage leads to loss of hla - dr - positive corneal langerhans cells .    2.5795050896025495
this study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty .    3.6998675961910075
ergotamine - containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks .    3.6320073079936566
among others , spastic UNK are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene .    3.271678085783383
the case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine - attacks since adolescence .    3.281852894325559
due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers .    2.76820089517916
after UNK of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely .    3.380324524400962
the spectrum of ergotamine - induced side - effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed .    3.0906149595085672
in this article , a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed , which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians .    3.4377494136457245
this model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help .    4.337029182871111
the heidelberg model of active internal quality assurance has three elements : ( 1 . )    3.1433869259994163
a qa - inventory for routine monitoring ; ( 2 . )    4.200444537912481
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and ( 3 . )    5.361161672570679
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists ( quality circles ) .    3.181448493700751
the focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results .    3.616020012483735
it is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles , where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed .    3.6184742433173835
this feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients .    3.5091767284507775
the heidelberg model of active internal quality assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of quality assurance , which is aimed at UNK and improving the quality and UNK of the psychotherapeutic service .    3.903749953651562
aims : in this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia ( UNK block ) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics .    3.7330128180119555
a pre - term infant weighing 900 g , gestational age 25 weeks , developed an acute abdomen .    3.2319400630074466
intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left ( UNK ) and right ( 24 g cannula ) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit .    3.473809157915329
during surgical exploration , a perforation of the terminal ileum was found .    3.1812269458390525
the operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end - to - end anastomosis and a double - lumen colostomy .    2.9403597324131074
major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems .    3.3965915452475346
despite transfusion of erythrocyte ( 100 ml ) , thrombocytes ( 75 ml ) , and albumin ( 50 ml ) , the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension .    4.237396369704734
administration of atropine , adrenaline , and calcium iv had no effect .    2.805232455010974
the operation could be finished only with UNK resuscitation .    3.0440627008531185
when the UNK were removed , livid , swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava .    3.2137292592472346
after insertion of a 24 g iv cannula into a vein of the right upper arm , the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful .    3.2713620350128374
UNK and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava .    3.698058754220482
if venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation , venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure .    3.4383831294094205
due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre - UNK , a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre - operative UNK .    3.3168567569966485
while complementary medicine and UNK is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices , there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness .    3.839302805416975
in our study , we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of formica rufa d6 and UNK of the patient ' s own blood is superior to injection of placebo .    3.485366421384894
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective , randomized , double - blind study .    2.8155489583231628
during four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of formica rufa d6 in combination with 0 . 5 ml of blood or 1 . 5 ml nacl intramuscular .    3.7743110579075387
before and after therapy , mobility , thoracic UNK and doctor ' s overall assessment were measured in addition to patient ' s health status , using a german version of the arthritis impact measurement scales , before and after therapy as well as four , twelve , and UNK weeks later .    3.986388849996738
we were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured .    3.1763381627835665
therefore , the therapy under study may not be regarded effective .    3.1476922552513433
a 32 - year - old man was accused of attempted UNK .    3.102197286171597
while UNK at the side of the road he felt an erection .    3.5003659117831423
he approached a 9 - year - old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation .    2.7240270985284987
shortly afterwards he was arrested .    3.313574120875477
he UNK , but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence , which he normally would never have thought of .    3.324221187853136
shortly before the event a UNK had seen him UNK in a poor state of orientation .    3.5626603989299164
three months later in UNK he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery .    3.663708116259984
the evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence .    3.1899499544207606
with regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later , a pathogenetic connection , in terms of a preceding UNK leak , might be assumed .    3.116885264991764
we present a 43 - year - old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures UNK for 12 years .    2.8446432057747515
the patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness .    2.6745269692106017
neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal .    3.837212864230153
after sleep deprivation an interictal electro - UNK demonstrated a recurrent excess of UNK activity over the right frontal and UNK area .    3.113257039156594
a cerebral pet study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right UNK and UNK region .    4.351134898536722
the sleep structure was extremely fragmented .    3.293227955427828
carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks , followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night .    3.5206627101423256
UNK as add on therapy diminished the UNK seizures to 1 to 3 per night .    3.1575936304574004
introduction : we attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in UNK infants for practical use in a tertiary care center .    3.04540331999228
the influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of UNK intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated .    3.0747786639596657
we report a UNK driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin ; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin - dependent antibodies .    2.868019250985855
six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed , preventing an imminent compartment syndrome .    3.927560514469182
another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face , as well as severe headache .    3.7995627571197628
his platelet count increased from 134 000 / µl to 258 000 / µl .    2.8140139702710045
after exclusion of other causes for these symptoms , a reaction to heparin - dependent antibodies ( heparin - platelet - factor 4 complex ) was demonstrated 2 days later .    2.9967973003559725
thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin ( UNK ) and elevation of thrombocytes to 445 000 / µl was noted .    3.4745888462764576
shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 ie unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock , which could be managed with cortisone .    3.2219341528244176
we suggest that in hit the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin .    2.808722172411466
the cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen - antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte .    3.02196197479984
this is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application , even though the symptoms may vary .    3.4092251687461306
as thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin - induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with hit - the disease should rather be named " heparin allergy " .    3.5532362080549134
we suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types i - iv .    3.122321417359724
the new types i and ii are similar to hit types i and ii .    2.902112084987208
type iii is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes , and type iv the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms .    2.9656746215217313
in recent years , lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia .    2.8558581899546716
using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease , including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations .    3.703953258838687
the patients involved were a boy with pierre robin syndrome , a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in UNK ' s syndrome , a case with nager ' s syndrome , and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 ( UNK - syndrome ) .    3.7787038581997123
the distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation , ranging from 6 to 28 mm , was achieved .    3.5001507085658297
real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities , pelvic UNK with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip , knee and ankle joint .    3.3261845648811192
morbidity and mortality after reversal of hartmann ' s procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low .    3.050847983953534
aim : to investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of hartmann ' s procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient .    3.023760394944422
method : nineteen patients were investigated .    3.129990357254959
the postoperative course was followed prospectively .    3.0993691903017475
all patients were UNK 9 months after surgery .    2.7539536468374712
results : laparoscopic reversal of hartmann ' s procedure was attempted in 19 patients .    2.5919612521179554
one patient did not want the laparoscopic technique .    2.9434449429723664
in two cases ( 11 % ) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary ; thus , 16 patients were operated laparoscopically .    3.5025727173209216
median operative time was 114 ( 65 - 180 ) min .    3.4843618600855875
with the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed .    2.768989458186218
patients ' convalescence was fast .    3.114059524050685
first evacuation took place 3 . 3 ( 3 - 5 ) days after surgery , complete oral nutrition 3 . 6 ( 3 - 5 ) days after surgery .    3.6406670741617395
duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7 . 5 ( 5 - 12 ) days .    4.3216174412827435
one patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation .    2.7145652218024106
conclusion : laparoscopically assisted hartmann ' s reversal is technically demanding but feasible .    2.988204295517601
postoperative morbidity is low , duration of hospitalisation short , convalescence fast .    3.2724415542912095
thus , good arguments exist for performing reversal of hartmann ' s procedures laparoscopically .    2.861444131454293
mechanical ventilation is a well - UNK strategy in intensive care medicine .    3.080087919099995
icu trauma patients require analgesia , and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time .    3.262135406308293
the weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome , showing tachycardia , hypertonia , tachypnea and UNK .    3.025969043130312
although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms , tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation .    3.133284620034906
adding sufentanil , an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl , tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency .    3.2753988076552614
in this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both , the patient and physician .    3.6952965486111142
in comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone , 72 patients treated with clonidine / sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation ( 4 . 8 vs 7 . 6 days ) and until discharge from the icu ( 7 . 7 vs 12 . 4 days ) .    3.5824907388746743
the number of UNK caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16 . 0 to 2 . 8 % .    3.3996776440191114
background : with regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues , microsurgical techniques , hla typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection , and postoperative treatment UNK have been improved in recent years .    3.145210831980705
this now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed .    3.074019918853633
however , in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear .    2.894783215482889
the occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in UNK caused only minor UNK due to the UNK and determined actions of the institutions involved .    3.753727843865192
however , this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat .    2.8982317032132543
as a result the who presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to UNK an imminent or ongoing pandemic .    3.01167522643445
strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan .    3.1239223467670096
furthermore the who suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans .    2.8428830914503602
given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock , immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy .    3.301605342178924
drugs having the properties to neutralize UNK have also been considered .    3.3031704510912143
so far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents ( UNK , UNK , anti tnf antibodies , UNK ) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit .    4.320070698324027
in certain trials results were UNK , or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies .    3.370296256217024
in certain other trials , like those on antibodies against tnf , some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients .    3.124440536229445
thus , new trials are on their ways .    3.1245852173901048
so far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re - examine the concept of immunomodulation , and to UNK strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host , while not putting him at risk .    3.355029991116201
recently , percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy ( pdt ) has become more frequent , since the technique can be UNK relatively easily .    3.773248035806285
our study seeks to evaluate pdt in terms of its effectivness and UNK on a cardio - surgical icu .    3.0513268726495473
recently , two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics , sevoflurane and desflurane , have been approved for clinical use in germany .    3.1907906582138477
their low solubility in blood is the most important common property , and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used .    3.61368196495811
extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted .    3.0702466924869296
both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia , permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia .    2.8436583026818623
for sevoflurane , there are additional advantages : a pleasant odor , negligible airway irritation , and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane .    3.0889833193044978
a certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane ( 2 - 5 % ) to UNK fluoride and degradation to compound a in carbon dioxide absorbents .    3.3840197068247435
the extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects .    3.5647629730114327
new insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound a may well support clinical experience .    2.888892725527298
desflurane strongly UNK in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity .    3.736789011244232
nevertheless , potential side - effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of co , from its extreme UNK and irritating airway effects .    3.0924055573892084
thus , desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia , especially in children .    3.717387726493224
the tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity , especially at concentrations above 1 . 0 mac , limits its application in patients with cardiac disease .    3.656923539826256
the doctor in charge , who is generally the medical director , is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational UNK within his or her department .    2.8681066003242526
even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable .    3.035123438783601
for this reason , the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training .    3.0956748331046042
every training measure must guarantee specialist standards ; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist .    3.3448508083241886
a legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times .    3.9605158908751523
operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist ; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization .    2.9580214652849026
because of staff shortages it often happens that UNK UNK - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on .    3.1126982811187256
in the high - risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times .    3.0431348239456644
the UNK from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are UNK and that adequate free time is guaranteed .    3.125417764371745
there must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed .    3.032518051495802
each sector must know its own area of responsibility .    3.05040318758558
the doctor in charge is UNK for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment .    3.1945446017542434
uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his / her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects .    3.2377327589845635
georg friedrich stromeyer ( UNK - UNK ) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine .    3.3779466282260233
furthermore , every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in germany knows him because of the " stromeyer hook " , which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures .    3.928305525193902
this special aspect as well as stromeyer ' s biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine .    3.4006286392367433
changes in clinical presentation of crohn ' s disease ( cd ) , patients ' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation , general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study .    3.466898652556753
UNK operations for cd were divided into consecutive groups and analysed .    3.3915252474786297
in an increasing number of cases patients presented with the " UNK type " rather than the " UNK type " of complaints .    3.8475350599830915
the duration of disease and of medical management increased .    3.529688798596709
patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition .    3.0597008969128354
we found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent cd or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons .    3.3967053909722362
primary surgery for cd increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut ; in the case of recurrence , of multiple , minimal resections .    3.6415524077560772
the average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced .    3.1344939250585764
the complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery .    2.7446829637351224
even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity .    3.4636521554969004
etiologically , numerous factors must be taken into account , the most significant one being arteriosclerosis .    3.767663648256799
the clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous .    2.917536537531602
ct and , above all , intra - arterial dsa allow for a diagnosis .    3.2600066650872295
a generous consideration of indicating operative intervention , even in asymptomatic patients , is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture .    3.6633617883011693
the UNK therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or UNK by embolization .    3.295841456613774
in the future a treatment with coated stents ( UNK ) would also seem possible .    3.681349029496479
special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation .    3.1381250177502436
we report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the UNK inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion .    3.7706965346453774
background : clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders ( deficiencies of UNK - synthetase ( 4 ) , argininosuccinate - synthetase ( 2 ) and argininosuccinate - UNK ( 2 ) ) are described .    3.8342511276861617
methods / therapy : emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i . v . as well as peritoneal dialysis and / or modified hemodialysis .    3.8166591322468166
chronic treatment comprised a low - protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids , of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched - chain amino acids .    2.787093341724999
results : within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed , leading to developmental retardation later in life .    2.910595393196968
four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age .    3.216320493043047
during follow - up , all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively .    2.9431654623358092
phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side - effects than benzoate , branched - chain amino acids had favourable effects .    2.8710235072722865
one patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development .    3.361629134704212
conclusions : neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder .    2.7834688350020844
specific therapy as described can be life - saving , although most children exhibit marked developmental delay .    3.0716345194008627
sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side - effects than sodium benzoate .    3.5194473799160924
therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications .    3.2977835881565896
pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation .    2.9047164927304303
large osseous defects in the UNK bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of UNK acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery .    3.872985751377352
the defects extend from the cranial to the central ; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this .    3.4795782789087153
the anchorage of a new implant must be adapted to the individual circumstances .    3.522142764963074
the new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access , the patient ' s general status and osseous UNK .    3.4255468538366456
in the optimum case , osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method .    2.9209468444914086
if this is not possible , special implants , mostly custom - made prostheses , have to be incorporated .    3.612332046043999
however , the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases .    4.000188896466185
in patients with progressive muscular dystrophy ( pmd ) invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances .    2.857398257086169
the aim of this study was a long - term follow - up of these patients .    2.705009294111378
twelve consecutive patients ( UNK , UNK , age 28 + / - 4 yrs ) without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study .    3.9598438112988834
they suffered from different stages of pmd type erb ( n = 4 ) , UNK - UNK ( n = 4 ) , UNK ( n = 2 ) and UNK - UNK ( n = 2 ) .    4.243027399722588
at the beginning of the study all patients underwent an invasive electrophysiologic study ( eps ) .    3.022579372178414
the follow - up of 5 . 5 yrs included regular clinical visits , ecgs , and holter recordings ( every 3 months ) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months .    3.123188463199301
in 4 patients the eps revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance ( UNK - acs 120 + / - UNK ) , and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found ( UNK max .    3.7393687390771144
conduction defects were seen independently from the type of pmd and the stage of the disease .    3.385017627261919
during the follow - up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ecg in 2 of 4 pts .    3.138674390183332
one of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .    2.7112702213621613
five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an av block grade i - iii and in one case additionally a bundle branch block .    3.231199894139715
four of these pts - whose pmd showed progression or who developed congestive cardiomyopathy - needed pacemaker implantation because of a first - degree av block + UNK bundle branch block ( n = 1 ) , a UNK ii second - degree av block ( n = 1 ) or a third - degree av block ( n = 2 ) .    3.1749857266206467
none of the pts with normal findings at the eps showed abnormal p - waves , an av block , or an UNK conduction disturbance during the follow - up .    2.9262373523685223
we conclude that intracardiac conduction disturbances , especially infrahisian defects including high - degree av blocks , are a common finding in pts with pmd .    3.0553165490190177
therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ecg and a holter recording is reasonable in these patients .    2.813099906347723
accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °c and is caused by exposure to cold , drugs , endocrine dysfunction , central nervous system disorders , skin disorders , and trauma .    3.165647521452903
depending on the degree of hypothermia , there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations .    3.4532134402830765
bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast , prostate , and lung .    3.4078773693603313
the decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology , presence and extent of UNK disease , and the performance status of the patient .    4.12335245542512
for patients with estrogen - receptor - positive breast cancer or prostate cancer , hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice .    3.173098607184055
in estrogen - receptor - negative breast cancer , and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases , chemotherapy should be initiated .    3.8284987943298825
all patients with small - cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy .    2.8052054368868027
bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with UNK .    3.283746202898468
radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult .    3.5375862235366293
new approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful .    3.095943190296135
although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth , we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences .    2.889303480271159
a condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions .    3.4271262187552236
it must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth .    2.9347336754155955
furthermore , the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention , significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment .    2.692947415134652
current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive UNK , temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia , and tumor debulking for congenital cystic UNK malformation of the lung and UNK teratoma .    3.1162679743663046
prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation .    3.370698129163601
maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention .    2.9613655980364237
the main associated risks are pre - term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes .    2.711618094756992
these developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future .    3.644994530578719
UNK - resistant s . aureus ( mrsa ) has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world .    3.52749185719241
in germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to mrsa has occurred during the last 10 years .    3.1199970888856767
especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming UNK or infected with mrsa .    3.80740048372827
this report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of mrsa , and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of mrsa in hospitals and nursing homes .    3.364675016254996
during general anaesthesia gas UNK significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques .    3.1816018722951043
gas climatisation , however , markedly also will be influenced by the temperature loss at , and corresponding water UNK within the UNK , factors which are related to the technical design and material of the patient hose system .    4.234422580742941
the objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1 . how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice .    2.976530868100861
2 . to investigate , whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used , proven beforehand to optimally UNK and UNK the anaesthetic gases .    3.363866699876401
introduction : undifferentiated , embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver , the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age ( 14 . 1 % ) .    3.9460747148997815
among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia .    3.116498000971357
embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults .    3.20403474628503
to our knowledge , only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years .    3.4686732675660705
methods and results : we now present the case of a 29 - year - old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma .    3.4600636985903694
conclusion : this case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver .    3.518626474999644
the management of this case comprised primary tamponade , interventional embolisation of the feeding artery , and secondary resection under stable conditions .    3.0910306807164623
substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders , which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy .    3.806000383908295
however reasons are discussed , why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients .    3.3398899769571826
insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency , structural problems , expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in UNK ' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves .    3.2417998499199325
though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes UNK , the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing .    3.4620674055688974
readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients .    3.47637528883537
therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented .    3.131766166070516
they are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude .    3.3208640908540494
they can be easily implemented in different settings .    3.1726917403613757
at the end of the first part of this review in - patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined .    3.4635230209192645
this will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches .    3.2864132681256697
the following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability .    3.2160718062514766
a model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis .    3.788563881713205
the concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive .    3.2142002493588886
four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined kirschner wire osteosynthesis ( kwo ) , our preferred method of treatment of unstable colles fracture .    3.2018394372158827
biocompatible osteosynthesis was achieved with an invasivity and stability comparable to that of kwo .    3.65537546401533
in conclusion , injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects .    2.5865507133494874
regarding the recent developments in UNK materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application .    3.1162533338422405
the " pain in the lower limbs " ( growing pain ) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour .    3.389261184357494
the delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and UNK on account of many differential diagnoses .    3.82726043431784
UNK of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation UNK with recording all differential diagnoses .    2.926775748734439
in psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the ' talking cure ' because they tend to act instead of UNK their experiences interactive UNK are rather common .    3.144561822984839
often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat .    3.208725606173876
the symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then .    2.9848495787671308
gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of ' body language ' suggests .    2.9863694362546913
instead as permanent concomitant of UNK it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist .    3.385903906892165
the surgical treatment of UNK veins demands complete exclusion of the primary UNK circuit .    3.5516515261021944
the diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms , on i . e .    3.0166710546964803
if there is saphenous vein agreement between them , phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation .    2.880025888654145
the prospective comparative examination of non - invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12 % of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3 % for the small with a correction of the operative procedure .    4.036626711006218
in 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis , only one diagnosis was correct with non - invasive measures .    3.2705425774330736
this leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms .    3.7325038332427
UNK odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x - rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability .    3.6407811878862244
in this aspect the classification based on UNK and d ' UNK takes a high risk to UNK the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation .    4.0793453546030305
therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism .    3.145911544270102
in this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction .    3.054037604462372
furthermore a better classification of UNK will be recommended .    3.544454410481649
in a period of 4 years between march 1994 and march 1998 , 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( UNK ) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery .    3.2098285929004016
recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6 , 3 % after mean 16 , 7 months follow - up ( nissen = 2 . 6 % , toupet = 2 . 3 % , dor / thal = 24 % , p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.86655975484869
persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2 . 1 % ( nissen = 2 . 6 % , toupet = 2 . 3 % , dor / thal = 0 % , n . s . ) .    2.8314944814510055
the assessment of visick ' s score at the latest control showed the following : visick i = 63 . 6 % , visick ii = 30 . 1 % , visick iii = 6 . 3 % , visick iv = 0 % .    3.6205991836051354
the outcome of the operation was rated " excellent " or " good " by 91 . 6 % of the patients .    3.1385364037961496
in contrast to auditory brainstem potentials ( abr ) , a more UNK defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials ( mlr ) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present .    3.799575761817248
to date , the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on mlr has not been completely known .    3.2582948850681643
no differences were found between the masking effects for abr and mlr evoked by tone bursts of 0 . 5 and 2 khz .    2.960591480702494
the high - pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the abr than on mlr .    3.1814157032135544
these different qualities have to be considered clinically when evaluating the methods and results of hearing testing with acoustic evoked potentials .    3.595921387816573
our findings show that mlr evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds , especially in low - frequency ranges .    3.269456566020113
objectives : to clarify the incidence of sudden UNK death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation ( htx ) .    3.4723698188924113
background : some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long - term success of the operation .    3.295293273751768
incidence , underlying risk factors , etiologies , and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined .    3.2531562544126396
methods : retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of UNK patients of the years 1984 - 1999 .    3.434139540464831
clinical events ( death , mode of death , re - htx , resuscitation ) were noted and analyzed by the kaplan - meier method and related to the patients ' characteristics by multivariate analysis .    3.2923179880360083
sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or UNK death .    3.626654847520101
clinical and postmortem findings ( autopsies are available in 12 / 18 sudden death patients ) were correlated to the mode of death .    3.243144430883383
results : during a mean follow - up interval of 4 . 6 + / - 3 . 5 years , 45 patients died ( 38 % ) .    3.844875592353657
the mode of death was non - sudden in 27 inpatients .    3.3137698176911607
18 deaths were sudden , 14 of these out of hospital .    3.342622102397676
in addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations , one of those patients died three month later suddenly , giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in UNK patients .    3.4684688127220875
the actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20 % after 6 and 40 % after 12 years .    3.5393456227009317
all three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented UNK events ( UNK av block , UNK arrest ) .    2.89084610513414
pacemakers were implanted in these patients .    3.5732605361735095
one of those died suddenly 2 months later .    3.0674813919406376
significantly more htx patients dying suddenly are smokers , had a lower left ventricular ejection fraction , and worse hemodynamics .    2.867357879696369
qrs width and pr interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest .    3.7246535738751456
in three cases , a decrease in heart rate variability , the occurence of sustained vt , and st segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated .    3.391374145940818
conclusions : sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after htx .    3.110336525542782
as htx patient numbers are rising constantly , sudden cardiac death in this population will represent a significant problem .    3.18782790406502
in our patients about 75 % of the arrests can be attributed to graft - vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection .    3.27554395973811
interestingly , some events may be caused from UNK rhythm disturbances .    3.3618217126143337
introduction : traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee .    3.825440607848629
the indications for operative and conservative treatment are still controversial .    2.9535328909310596
methods and results : from 1974 to 1994 , 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department .    3.0031578512284614
thirty - four of these patients were followed up for 3 - 16 years ( mean : 8 . 6 years ) .    3.574728828422044
in 29 cases of the follow - up group , reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed .    3.552289396772889
in the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone .    3.0487432067343163
at the time of follow - up , 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability , but 90 % had lack of motion as well .    3.1401266207639114
post - traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate .    3.029608900092178
thirty - five UNK of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the lysholm score .    4.354258869012719
conclusions : positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident , a low - energy trauma , e . g . , a sports - related injury , early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments , and initial postoperative functional treatment .    3.278475270282535
huntington ' s disease ( hd ) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a cag - triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes .    3.323749000373512
the results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different .    3.226021346896363
the development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so - called UNK inclusion bodies .    2.9477700044536377
this new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes UNK .    2.8484611025732227
recent studies on transgenic hd mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate UNK in the neurodegenerative process of hd which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease .    3.1232188793491313
transgenic animal models of hd will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches .    4.229097071983115
background : the whipple operation ( pd ) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region .    3.7361376865113636
however , the pylorus - preserving duodenopancreatectomy ( pppd ) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function .    3.032377411243445
methods : in a prospective randomized trial ( october 1994 - october 1998 ) pd and pppd were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life , operation time , duration of hospital stay , transfusions and perioperative morbidity .    3.047427372337699
quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions ( eortc - qlq - 30 ) pre - and postoperatively ( weeks 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 ) .    2.9020263372840365
results : a duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas ( n = 38 ) and the periampullary region ( n = 10 ) ( pd , n = 24 ; pppd , n = 24 ) .    3.7002298302811165
the pd and pppd groups did not differ according to age , gender or uicc stage .    3.187619656901471
operation time was shorter in the pppd group ( 206 + / - 48 vs UNK + / - 54 min ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.3999999138989527
morbidity did not differ between the two groups ( pppd 20 % vs pd 30 % , p > 0 . 05 ) .    3.1504317448026384
while there was no difference in global quality of life , gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the pppd group regarding appetite , nausea and diarrhea ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.815671490956292
while the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the pppd group ( n = 20 ) , this was true in only 60 % of the pd - group ( n = 14 ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.46152006092308
conclusion : pppd seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than pd .    3.6046151234163846
oxygen uptake ( v . o2 ) and carbon dioxide elimination ( v . co2 ) can be measured with an indirect UNK ; this method is well established in routine monitoring of icu patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress .    3.312746467272844
in various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole - body metabolism .    3.1850326556387936
the purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately .    2.946523689248473
abdominal aortic cross - clamping changes circulation , nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus v . o2 and v . co2 .    3.4227165401505326
we therefore used this operation for our study .    3.1583196888567495
for certain indications , anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation .    3.690136328742759
the surgeon UNK in operations on the vertebral column must UNK to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery .    3.1280948083725693
however , an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals .    2.996681476380679
for this purpose , the pig is a highly suitable model .    2.7780035233589837
the surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures , an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced UNK .    3.0685557266236665
in the animal model , a change in position - organ preparation from the cranial direction , a UNK approach to the UNK - has proved UNK .    4.169420503978088
operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three - dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures , created from the tomographic data of a patient .    3.7099638374877806
computer - assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field .    2.754185739136441
the desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma ( dscc ) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy .    3.706268841110351
the dscc has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural , perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion ( maximum 6 cm ! ) .    2.757406641003162
this type accounts for 8 . 2 % ( n = 44 ) of our collective of UNK squamous cell carcinomas ( scc ) of the skin and UNK border .    3.4935589435997683
all tumors were followed up for at least 3 years ( maximum 10 years ) .    3.154407550391984
the local recurrence rate was high ( 24 . 3 % ) even though micrographic surgery was carried out .    3.561633849759038
the rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high ( 22 . 7 % ) .    3.13830446643308
in comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of UNK of the remaining common 91 . 8 % scc ' s ( n = 550 ) was low : 2 . 6 % and 3 . 8 % , respectively .    4.650761216858313
the dscc seems to be identical with the so called UNK scc , the fine UNK scc or the scc with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well , but dscc is a better UNK histopathologic term for the entire group .    3.1375569019862004
the dscc is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently .    3.1516348589363425
in the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness .    2.8270206448173805
the interaction between the patient with als and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication , especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support .    3.5971692419337833
the patient and his family must be informed thoroughly about the natural history and the prognosis of als , depending on the individual disease process .    3.4359800195819155
already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled .    3.7871991785945043
if als patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term .    3.5715904353896617
background : the advent of UNK ct ( mdct ) constitutes a UNK leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging .    2.7580518824777176
however , while the basic principles of spiral ct still apply , we are now challenged to UNK our strategies in planning a ct study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of mdct .    3.3827817476507738
extracorporeal UNK ( ecp ) , a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years , is based on separation of a leucocyte / lymphocyte - enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood , extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8 - mop / uva and subsequent UNK of the cells in the patient .    4.092294138607351
its main effects seem to consist in changes to the immunologic behaviour of the UNK / modulated cells .    3.637467081523439
the immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment .    3.230713189895972
ecp is normally performed for 4 h per day on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks .    3.144921556036193
the treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects .    2.9853237670578454
in our department , UNK ecp treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed .    3.1139431223907397
these patients included 21 with cutaneous t - cell lymphoma ( ctcl ) , 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma , 4 with chronic graft - versus - host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris , epidermolysis bullosa UNK , lupus erythematosus and cutaneous UNK .    2.5639547929623063
patients with UNK and preserved UNK achieved the best responses of all patients with ctcl .    3.8445584327593747
a treatment combining ecp with UNK - , puva and / or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour - stage ctcl and lymph node involvement .    3.9579237472978996
progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50 % of our cases .    3.6099269122419777
treatment results were impressive in 4 patients with chronic graft - versus - host disease presenting with UNK and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes .    3.7001887081161264
a clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with UNK ( UNK - gottron syndrome ) .    4.108654716121492
the effectiveness of ecp seems to be quite well established in ctcl , but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses .    3.6798709477091545
ecp is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary .    3.4295663970147574
opportunistic infections after long - term treatment with azathioprine ( aza ) have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis ( mg ) .    3.854022479824687
the indication for immunosuppressive treatment in mg should be regularly UNK , particularly since at least 50 % of patients can discontinue aza after two to four years without risk of exacerbation .    3.3267677182174893
failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem .    3.4996307287830972
although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of UNK , occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to UNK interpretation .    3.520410472726874
we report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal UNK and UNK confirmed cholecystolithiasis .    3.423331752335254
during laparoscopic cholecystectomy , the gallbladder could not be detected .    3.436757567628403
after laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde UNK and abdominal computed tomography , agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed .    3.1578921515488254
this method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration .    3.3967405007974394
right colon diverticulitis , representing 1 - 3 , 6 % of cases of UNK disease is an uncommon cause of right lower UNK pain .    4.222314654104967
its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis .    3.718555601855725
patients are between 35 and 50 years old , have a history of 2 - 3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms .    4.154617729983523
the diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy .    3.040088359988618
conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease , whereas perforations , UNK and inflammatory tumors require resection .    3.5149564692953645
we describe the cases of six patients treated at our institution from 1991 to 1996 .    3.3541788571512225
presentation , geographic variations , diagnostic procedures and management are discussed .    3.1980782685687457
malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi .    3.637771606096509
uv exposure with an UNK dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma .    3.275468227431708
these changes are associated with an increased expression of hmb - 45 antigen .    3.0053394230364607
in addition , an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after uv exposure .    2.973273703355178
the increased number of melanocytes located in UNK layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression .    3.329008994204733
the uv light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro .    3.18364547506208
therefore , both keratinocyte - derived factors and direct influence of uv on the UNK system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes .    3.640536431177389
while these UNK evoked changes are reversible , the potential biologic relevance - especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade - UNK clarification .    3.3667893289158433
objectives minimally invasive surgical procedure for removal of the trochanteric UNK and , if necessary , UNK and / or fixation of the UNK tract at the greater UNK .    4.41111140886764
the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease .    3.4364656538705463
core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium - sized pre - collapsed lesions .    2.9910117486561045
for these types of lesions , osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success .    2.9890328924576237
for small or medium lesions that are post - collapse , various bone grafting procedures have been used .    3.238023950247691
this approach should be UNK with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large .    3.8464770360581104
limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement .    3.7499517521066177
if there is acetabular involvement , total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice .    3.1577550906897365
guillain barré syndrome ( gbs ) is an acute , inflammatory , demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system .    3.826118016936085
clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis , UNK and UNK autonomic disturbances .    3.7405148077833044
respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with gbs .    4.513970712796337
the present report of a 33 year old man with miller - fisher syndrome , a variant of the gbs , discusses the management of patients with gbs in the intensive care unit .    3.112704038615575
the UNK detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s .    3.465823443245294
despite numerous publications in this field , it has not been possible to standardize the method and establish the ideal antibody , either UNK or internationally .    3.645980923797791
molecular biological methods using pcr technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum .    3.166190843189673
as a result , UNK is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection .    3.519208140525243
objective : we report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway , the intubating laryngeal mask airway ( UNK , commercial name UNK ) , which was designed by a . i . j .    3.5635886854017254
brain to improve blind endotracheal intubation through a laryngeal mask .    3.1408407988154936
for several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected .    3.346623487819498
however , during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly .    3.7748228684975844
to validate this impression , we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident .    3.4762915556216276
it was found that 39 . 4 % of the chest tubes were placed UNK incorrectly and 21 . 2 % required some correction ; 39 . 4 % were placed correctly .    3.8633874865666686
in two cases ( 6 . 1 % ) life - threatening complications developed because of the chest tube , necessitating a thoracotomy in 1 patient and repeated pericardial UNK in the other .    3.982866847670993
based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident .    3.29847298612283
based upon the observation that some current approaches of quality assurance do not really come up to the specific characteristics of different psychotherapeutic settings , this article discusses quality assurance from the perspective of inpatient group psychotherapy .    3.1565154633255403
it differentiates issues of structural quality ( e . g .    2.795758767261898
the importance of the institutional frame , rules for indication , or treatment concepts ) , process quality with special consideration of problems connected with short term group treatment , and outcome quality , which in order to be assured needs the development of methods which reflect the group setting adequately .    3.332092872733553
we report on a case of extensive intraabdominal calcifications resulting from previous bacterial peritonitis .    2.718111751947759
the patient suffered from an obstructive ileus .    3.028485379579295
UNK was performed and the calcifications resected .    3.2927496241913423
to avoid recurrence , radiotherapy ( 15 gy ) and indomethacin were given .    3.051966593794972
a literature review revealed only two cases of intraabdominal calcifications following peritonitis .    3.0689236015012877
in germany there is still an urgent need for action in regard to screening for breast cancer .    3.0897144397247867
the UNK of research projects for mammography screening proves this .    3.1337190247037032
the following reports the results of the munich field study .    3.338202107646593
in 2 years , UNK breast cancer cases were registered ( status 6 / 98 ) .    3.171657515791549
screening data were available for UNK patients .    3.731610942774456
the reduction in mortality , found in randomized studies , due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed .    3.3742856740713907
a relative reduction of 44 . 8 % in 10 - year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25 . 1 % through palpation , in comparison with " doing nothing " .    3.8792496026675254
we could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the munich region .    3.1795828174757252
if the mammographies carried out today were used at 2 - year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years , then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70 % of the women .    3.709637177930265
the known facts regarding the population - based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in germany are and what they should fulfill .    3.0222169649213675
insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) reconstruction is a typical complication .    3.104491399868906
between 1 january 1992 and 31 december 1997 a total of 604 operations at the acl were performed in the traumatology department of nuremberg hospital .    3.4248775749643663
during the same period 48 " transplant failures " were treated .    3.10609984497661
another reason for a re - rupture of the transplant was by trauma . the different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population .    3.8373193637975502
the 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment ( i = acl sutures , ii = artificial ligament , iii = semitendinosus tendon , iv and v = ipsi - or contralateral bone - patellar - bone graft harvest after acl reconstruction ) , so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable .    3.20879425829247
of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1 / 2 years using the lysholm scores and the oak scores .    3.320521693326798
the total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be UNK as good using the evaluation scale of lysholm and UNK .    3.3403013894997162
using the oak score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups ; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone - tendon - bone graft harvest after acl reconstruction were the worst .    3.2598914031417454
the UNK using the oak score was 74 points and was considered " moderate " .    3.1975622818986063
the score results were discussed and compared with the current literature .    3.4956474799563657
in this case report , we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs .    3.087265156215181
scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked .    3.568341054994735
medical history , clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis .    3.952862540479746
the diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with UNK acid .    2.924764509007317
hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal .    3.1627834403839885
among these tumors , ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance .    2.8341839524241164
we describe a 26 - year old female patient who presented with left - sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus .    2.9297081864866668
t2 - weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space - occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion .    3.412608241572152
bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high - resolution computed tomography .    3.2373657460384835
a hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach .    3.149513249890411
histologically , new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma .    3.6312433195247595
in general , radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma .    2.7736044110135216
based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation , the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma .    3.2165971709227925
however , reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation .    3.3555622680210604
myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction .    3.327100977687304
recovery may be delayed ( " stunning " ) , or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ( " hibernation " ) and ischemia may go on to necrosis , thus , contributing to chronic heart failure .    3.223925747775607
in addition , myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation , which may result in chronic left heart failure .    2.990584189725438
this process is characterized by hemodynamic , neurohumoral , and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely UNK .    3.7058282041018207
hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction , and , in most cases years after myocardial infarction , in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure .    4.236151188971112
neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines , atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin , and in an activation of the renin - angiotensin - system .    3.476886959914286
plasma endothelin - 1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure , and prognosis was related to endothelin levels .    4.080197074951637
diminished response of vessels to endothelium ( UNK / no ) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure .    3.3250309931608464
local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart , e . g . , systemic activation to hemodynamic changes .    3.312778583051831
structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium .    3.548933153408298
molecular control of these processes which include various cell types , such as cardiomyocytes and UNK , are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance .    3.660560428301744
postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice UNK .    3.350639659027613
the aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert - confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered .    2.857884892746351
a total of 261 UNK concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated .    2.6825142669668556
of these , 43 . 7 % claims were successful .    3.5334672163704517
the most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis ( 34 . 2 % ) , followed by UNK treatment ( 27 . 2 % ) and insufficient surgical revision ( 5 . 3 % ) .    3.5808097532572334
in 33 . 3 % , combined types of negligence were found .    3.243346064143445
most frequently , negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones .    3.004630283916973
the highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints ( 69 . 2 % ) .    3.0170392334423113
insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15 . 3 % .    3.342743718741973
the majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts , which could be avoided , e . g . , by a clear definition of infection , consultation of a second opinion , a 2nd - look operation , undelayed and radical surgical revision , UNK follow - up and UNK documentation .    3.477170867296221
abstract patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment .    4.229658007325149
a total of 40 patients were included ( 20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery ) .    2.8868025349157582
a questionnaire with 28 items similar to the sf - 36 was answered during scheduled UNK .    2.815515114076782
on the third postoperative day , the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed ( 80 % vs . 32 % ) and complained of intervention - related pain ( 90 % vs . 42 % ) and UNK pain ( 26 % vs . 15 % ) ; 55 % of the patients suffered from obstipation ( vs . 5 % of the endovascular group ) .    4.095557511720865
furthermore , the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified .    3.0101822568986902
in comparable percentage , both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively .    3.0960598840580675
sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group ( 33 % vs . 13 % three months postoperative ) .    3.8601511914621
in addition , the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities ( 25 % vs . 40 % ) and had more fear of UNK ( 35 % vs . 6 % ) .    3.657302806955385
the patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations ( 39 % vs . 5 % ) that were often related to x - ray exposure ( 67 % vs . 20 % ) .    3.641507994656732
all of the conventionally operated patients had a sense of improvement ( vs . 89 % of the endovascular group ) ; nevertheless only 28 % felt completely healthy , compared to 11 % of the endovascular treated patients .    3.4481770298588708
advantages of the endovascular treated patients were " short hospital stay " , " decreased pain " , " smaller scars " , and a " shorter UNK to bed " .    3.902904848800682
after intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality - of - life aspects .    2.8973835321784027
after 3 months , differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities .    3.1063674275917275
the patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent x - ray examinations than the conventionally treated group .    3.284662902365061
in the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period .    2.894088998509693
however , about 20 % of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation .    3.5492799406599485
apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive , the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles .    3.2680795132395475
furthermore , beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are , e . g . , left heart failure , inadequate sedation , neuropsychiatric issues , malnutrition and aspiration .    2.9753862615448154
the mere application of a consistent weaning strategy ( independent from its concrete content ) leads to an improved success rate .    3.396045929301088
in this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with : 1 ) the concept of interventions ( in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes UNK respiratory muscles ) , 2 ) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3 ) organisation of the t - tube trials .    3.1070003050669928
a new approach in weaning of long - term ventilated patients is non - invasive mechanical ventilation ( nmv ) .    3.3281695577259036
compared to invasive mechanical ventilation nmv aims at reducing weaning time , decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis .    2.9631019450271863
finally , the last section addresses terminal weaning .    2.781133411499342
the psychoanalytic cure is characterized by a basic UNK of time and time - UNK .    4.075881389095356
freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock ( the time of the machine ) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture .    3.2734275811008233
the temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path .    2.831391937248113
on the opposite , in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished .    3.9427732034633753
" symmetrical UNK " prevails ( UNK UNK ) .    3.2687046515357796
this UNK is reflected in the technical principles .    3.295851652146539
free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path , again and again .    2.780763089909436
the tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the UNK of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going .    3.4974528521630126
present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure .    3.1038779264248313
several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine , as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology , have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine .    3.47903036939992
indeed , family studies , UNK analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis .    3.0418235786154924
the influence of UNK factors , however , remains mostly unknown .    3.5653160560825246
recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity .    3.180210743832303
a locus for familial UNK migraine ( fhm ) , the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal - dominant transmission , has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown , i . e . different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus .    3.486593774335567
further investigations should concentrate on identifying the fhm gene on chromosome 19p13 , on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes , and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees .    2.9325487605190834
this would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and , thus , to therapeutic developments .    3.5412948879647117
radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and UNK osteoporosis to very rare UNK and hereditary or acquired disorders .    2.9590931907075575
as bone mass is lost , changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur .    3.4691709733538527
the changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease .    3.3094632634118577
even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis , visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique .    3.1923238409877515
with UNK and radiographic absorptiometry two methods exist that rely on conventional radiography and allow for a quantification of bone mass .    3.3007186450872514
this article describes the author ' s experience during the 1 - year UNK pittsburgh UNK from 1 april 1996 to 31 march 1997 .    3.004817289357041
the article is focused on the work in the UNK research center and the center for sports medicine of the department of orthopedic surgery in pittsburgh .    3.8593698732976196
the author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments , using robotic technology .    2.7117465540737133
organizational and social aspects of the life in pittsburgh are discussed .    3.7077070474448925
the different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the pak calcium - load test .    2.4143927684716537
to improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria ( > 6 . 25 mmol / day ) .    3.3163115013946873
we also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the pak calcium - load test .    2.8837681921380276
in most cases the pathophysiological constellations which pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown .    3.2339009831540704
to date , diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria ( except phpt ) .    2.5787455543784543
as a consequence , a therapeutic problem arises : a low - calcium diet should not be generally recommended , since some patients may develop osteopenia .    3.155798069219116
from our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn : ( 1 ) hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma .    3.4670289974361688
( 2 ) the UNK - independent osteogenic form should be treated with UNK .    3.868084715668239
( 3 ) hypercalciuria with increased 1 , 25 - UNK d should be treated by low - calcium diet .    3.234330525159131
a 58 - year old man with wilson ' s disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon .    3.466004597229714
the histological investigation showed advanced degeneration of tendon structure and cupper deposits .    2.837550004891384
after UNK the patient had complete cure with full range of movement .    3.52865063717079
we discuss about relation of wilson x s disease , cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue .    3.146881799599258
within the framework of the national health interview and examination survey 1998 the short form questionnaire sf - 36 has been applied to measure the health related quality of life ( UNK ) .    2.7036671536450085
this opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the german adult population .    3.0846055951311873
thus , the very complex UNK between morbidity , satisfaction , risk factors , health related UNK , social status , age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated .    3.5987294690656007
first results of the survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the sf - 36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level .    3.388406744443078
the von willebrand ' s disease affects about 1 - 3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people .    4.032470672660611
originally described by the UNK physician UNK von willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis , UNK and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures .    3.882769736294626
in von UNK disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von willebrand factor ( vwf ) which has two major functions : it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall , and it UNK as a complex with factor viii , protecting it from rapid degradation .    3.339962831228736
more than 20 different types and subtypes of vwd have been described but almost all patients can be classified as having 1 of the 2 most common types of vwd .    3.691574860199399
about 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10 - 20 % present UNK with type 2a and 2b vwd type 3 in about 10 % .    3.401294194114224
by taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vwd and to make the appropriate diagnosis .    3.5116098147524526
if the vwd is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time , bleeding time , factor viii : c , ristocetin cofactor , and vwf antigen .    2.655034333038688
additional testing of ristocetin induced UNK adhesion ( UNK ) , the UNK structure and collagen binding test and UNK - analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v . willebrand disease .    3.7805313774552234
the treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin .    2.8652132321555714
in patients with severe type 1 , type 2b , UNK and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin , the appropriate treatment is a factor viii concentrate that is rich of vwf .    3.5034037826290083
until now no recommendations in the orthopaedic literature have been found regarding diagnosis and treatment of UNK patients .    3.6862853902364763
based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vwd over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vwd in orthopaedic surgery is presented .    3.066365640721793
in a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized UNK every invasive procedure in patients with vwd can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding .    3.6428714694499047
patients with a prior myocardial infarction ( mi ) have a high risk of perioperative UNK compared with the normal population ( 5 % - 8 % vs . 0 . 1 % - 0 . 7 % ) [ 10 ] .    4.0588411567237985
according to rao [ 13 ] , a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range .    3.167177892266905
in most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as rao recommended : this would UNK both hospital structure and financial resources .    3.3033209040445435
we studied the incidence of perioperative mi and other cardiac events in patients with prior mi .    4.130472947101787
during the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced .    2.9552607484339353
in addition to this clinical evaluation , we performed perioperative holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin t ( parts ii and iii ) .    2.897307881744612
small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless .    3.4903799658095123
in contrast , large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence .    3.3221829948101576
the development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors , but rather to the patients ' attitude of neglect .    3.628584811792834
the case of a 62 - year - old patient , UNK such attitude , demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a UNK ulcerating tumor .    3.4387263823975767
this epidemiologic , retrospective follow - up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the university hospital of johann UNK UNK university in frankfurt / main .    3.564002237419582
over a period of 21 years ( 1972 - 1992 ) , roughly 21 , 000 forensic autopsies revealed 39 cases ( 0 . 19 % ) of natural deaths occuring during sexual activity .    3.2920809493221466
except for two women , all of these cases were men of an average age of 61 . 3 years .    3.8699448503453766
the most frequent cause of death was myocardial infarction ( n = 21 / 53 . 8 % ) , three of these cases involving pericardial tamponade accompanied by UNK .    3.8525244192028616
the medical history of twelve of the deceased showed a previous myocardial infarction .    2.9251510138599457
most of the deaths took place during or after sexual intercourse or manual stimulation .    2.96544101228412
in most cases sudden death occured during the sexual act with a UNK .    3.0803808858972936
the risk for women is lower by a factor of 12 .    3.520018030790089
current concepts in treating arthritis by gene transfer are described , including different vector systems and strategies of gene transfer into target cells .    3.1552218952137
UNK UNK gene products are a variety of growth factors which facilitate increased matrix synthesis and UNK in articular chondrocytes .    3.775394700539633
furthermore , rheumatoid joint destruction can be treated genetically by the transfer of certain antiinflammatory cytokine genes , which provide locally high concentrations of the antiinflammatory gene product .    3.1591294344526584
first clinical UNK using the irap gene ( interleukin i receptor antagonist protein ) to eliminate the inflammatory reaction caused by interleukin i in rheumatoid joints are on its way .    3.0968298222016535
in order to investigate potential improvement in cartilage regeneration retroviral tgf - gene transfer in rabbit articular chondrocytes has been carried out .    2.549946074501841
the tgf - group showed an in vitro increase in collagen type ii neosynthesis by UNK % , compared to normal chondrocytes .    3.24323327863245
spreading depression is a fascinating phenomenon that can be provoked by chemical , electrical or mechanical stimuli of the cortex .    3.078242004443302
spreading depression - like transient depolarizations are observed in the UNK tissue after focal ischemia .    3.6049337824937395
the reduction in electrical activity and a negative direct current potential shift UNK over the cortex with a rate of 2 - 5 mm / minute are the physiological hallmarks .    3.2517424644805084
it is thought that spreading depression and peri - infarct depolarizations might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke .    2.4481502402704516
however , these events have never been detected in humans .    2.923328323011007
this paper reviews the physiological characteristics of spreading depression and peri - infarct depolarizations and discusses their potential role in migraine and stroke .    2.239013177640235
the mmr combined vaccination reveals an effective method for prevention of these diseases and their consecutive symptoms .    3.5639012359983644
by means of the twice - done mmr vaccination measles , mumps and the congenital rubella syndrome could be eliminated .    2.556506326565649
with the increasing demands on hospitals for improved quality and lower costs , hospitals have been forced to reevaluate their manner of operation and quality assurance programms .    3.036316408580872
hospitals have also been faced with UNK UNK and intense competition .    4.271805830725969
this article reviews current quality - management systems and examines their position in dermatology .    2.7586116384954877
the continuous follow - up of all cruciate ligament lesions showed the correctness of patient - adapted procedures .    3.1771964932685557
while the gold standard for repair is a replacement procedure , direct repair with autologous augmentation is an excellent option in adolescents .    3.2106689068651724
the results of 13 single - stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed .    3.2032373860707186
no complete flap loss occurred in any case .    2.929851404267197
the results with radial forearm flap reconstructions proved to be better functionally and aesthetically .    3.353809529720609
due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses , the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged .    3.262272904932764
pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks .    3.7518154269390402
psychotherapists have the alternative , to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves , or otherwise leave this important task to external instances .    3.0554723515049615
those will apply their own criteria in developing a concept .    3.2106069680812617
this paper discusses the question , how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine , without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved .    2.9720770951930198
this paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy .    2.828226042876262
UNK pemphigoid ( cp ) comprises a UNK of patients with a chronic UNK blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes ; lesions characteristically heal with scarring .    3.56352095866021
immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating UNK of the igg and less frequently of the iga class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone .    3.1536857281899624
these autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of cp .    3.082617667094901
most patients show binding to the bullous pemphigoid antigen 2 ( bpag2 ) , collagen type UNK , with a UNK of 180 kd .    3.663537858061567
a smaller group of patients with cp have autoantibodies to laminin 5 .    3.9177069587184117
animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules ( bpag2 and laminin 5 ) are important in blister formation .    3.0279230595563176
there are other UNK described in cp ; however , they are only found in small groups of cp patients and most of them are not further characterised .    3.613788282553464
the described molecules are part of the UNK adhesion complex .    4.367057549112617
impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis ; better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of UNK within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture .    3.9032178472226122
study objective : the clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis .    3.144216006353148
ketoprofen also acts through UNK acid as a central antagonist on the nmda receptor .    3.2556443281099017
due to this central analgesic mechanism of ketoprofen , we expected an analgesic preemptive effect .    2.7809129496094367
this study was carried out following the UNK / UNK preemptive effect study design .    3.625552278892782
UNK of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis , facial UNK and UNK .    3.2795824264470474
this article presents the results of the surgical correction of orbital hypertelorism in 24 patients .    3.170597655146108
using this operation technique , the bony UNK distance was decreased from an average of 47 . 6 mm to 22 . 8 mm .    3.6018189154151115
however , the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits .    3.0899998577383325
the intercanthal distance decreased from an average of 58 . 5 mm to 44 . 5 mm , whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to 40 . 8 mm .    3.881639443995731
a strabismus UNK was seen preoperatively in 18 patients , postoperatively only in 8 patients .    3.7188817223728434
four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia .    3.416977530343808
we conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate .    3.070600763108799
four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a t4 carcinoma , 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema , destruction of the infected dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens .    3.466429594607824
successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by UNK blind plasty ( UNK ) and transposition of the omentum UNK for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity .    3.6528048591652484
the rate of prosthetic infections is between 0 . 3 and 2 . 5 % and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses .    4.183191381325099
after lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue .    3.1333789575877526
in intrathoracic infectious complications , extra - anatomic bypass grafting or autogenous vascular graft implantation should be considered .    3.1712454500279494
if there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures , first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue .    2.8108838637454348
the evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most UNK and challenging aspects of the daily practice in UNK .    3.6940677422630492
for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi , standardized and reproducible criteria are required .    3.212875390040498
in case of the diagnosis of melanoma , the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure .    3.563326137854453
the following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the deutsche UNK gesellschaft .    3.4371240923772723
recent studies have shown that acute infections , especially of the respiratory tract , are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia .    3.116475824768481
additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and UNK .    3.880100251564921
however , the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far .    2.864157790579663
therefore we performed a case - control study using a standardized questionaire and examination .    3.3542707139877392
we investigated 66 patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia / stroke and 60 age - and sex - matched UNK neurological patients as a control group .    2.774340539163822
dental status was determined by a so called total dental index ( tdi ) which reflects primarily caries , periodontitis , periapical lesions , UNK and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index ( pi ) .    3.313353385261879
specifically , older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects .    3.2088938980391037
a predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status .    3.579671212632444
in conclusion , poor dental health , mainly resulting from chronic dental infections , may be associated with an increased risk for cerebrovascular ischemia .    3.0819627872781585
the results must now be verified in larger studies .    3.041560271849573
as chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor , their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine .    3.4088243060584156
adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood .    3.4970750906028276
it involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture .    3.3731786830103925
emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their UNK effect .    3.530653847495871
glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay of anti - inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti - inflammatory effects .    3.5325379829586954
antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully during periods of exacerbation .    3.5156021154356165
systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of UNK atopic eczema .    3.9444929198249477
in cases of bacterial - triggered eczema , the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful .    3.4063671898549495
the present paper presents data obtained over a 12 year period , on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some 650 arthritic and 180 non - arthritic ( n ) human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method .    3.1959826285529394
when the relative metabolic ( synthetic / repair activity ) of these human cartilages was compared , it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis ( oa ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50 % as compared with n cartilages .    3.0065240057868037
however , the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between non - arthritic and oa , but was very substantially increased in ra cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus .    2.920691494823679
the action of 13 nsaids was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage UNK synthesis .    3.1668039791338276
3 of these nsaids were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis .    3.054574067037894
consideration of the results in this study and from published material , led to the suggestion that nsaids may be divided into 3 categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages : 1 .    3.4950880869710925
those such as aceclofenac , UNK and UNK which can stimulate matrix synthesis 2 .    3.7704128934314083
those such as UNK , UNK acid and aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and , 3 .    3.9820003173389193
those like naproxen , ibuprofen , indomethacin , UNK which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis .    2.96395630192336
it is suggested that the UNK action of group 1 nsaid is due to inhibition of locally produced il1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity .    3.146146557809636
other nsaids may also inhibit il1 synthesis or release , but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism .    2.92220654574818
these experiments led to the suggestion that nsaids such as aceclofenac would be appropriate for long - term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to UNK between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be UNK in vivo .    3.177881855553879
the article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre - operative anxiety and its impact on the post - operative course development .    3.812511378042668
then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety - syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described .    3.7764283920651467
the treatment lasted 6 hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery .    2.6977232469304733
the interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment .    3.7329864137686353
the results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy .    2.884200226772058
physiologically , angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role , for example , in wound healing .    3.375086850416491
pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process , in which specific angiogenic factors , as well as growth factors , extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved .    3.5995300833889115
tumor growth is characterized by an imbalance in favor of angiogenic over angiogenesis - inhibiting factors .    3.3981681499440244
some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor , UNK / basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet - derived endothelial cell growth factor .    3.4582764611517556
the most important angiogenesis inhibitors are UNK and UNK .    3.0406858512729364
to date , the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors .    3.639160793113733
for most urological tumors , the grade of tumor vessel formation , measured as UNK density , has been associated with metastases , tumor growth and clinical course .    3.4311019406833783
the prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors .    3.6233364245788855
systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology .    3.523635706169245
introduction : cpr is an essential part of resuscitation .    3.338617692299004
the knowledge and skill of german medical students in cpr performance were studied .    2.8660525936445436
psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly UNK .    3.605591621578239
indeed , since its beginning , it was characterised by the two - sided orientation towards disorder and resources .    3.519185827389726
contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter , especially UNK conceptions of the analysis of transference , lay the ground for better integrating both aspects .    3.3803180204824828
this development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique , and especially to interpretation .    3.6552867852532565
more than before , contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside UNK processes .    2.7330650772711387
during the last few decades , traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number , and traffic accidents have also increased .    3.1487305241391135
depending on the speed , direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact , different patterns of injury occur .    3.3399957738357546
basically , they are classified as hip dislocations , dislocation fractures and acetabular fractures .    3.1686678107813457
several classification systems have been developed for these injuries .    3.8991447887434734
commonly , UNK and UNK ' s or UNK ' s classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures .    4.96203883320818
for acetabular fractures , judet and letournel ' s classification and its newer version developed by UNK ( ao classification ) are generally accepted .    3.3318459151089437
fractures of the femoral head , though included in these classifications , are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in 1957 by UNK .    2.933634121437555
the multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches .    3.2863774412238156
no single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion .    3.6623486574810364
approaches are either considered limited ( kocher - langenbeck , ilioinguinal iliofemoral ) when they permit access only to a restricted segment of the joint , or extended ( extended iliofemoral , maryland , UNK ) when they allow all - around visualization of the hip joint .    3.181010718730683
the choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age , preexisting disease , and concomitant injuries .    3.4879263417301054
the decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery , the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches .    3.065042169018643
the indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than 3 weeks after trauma .    3.5541178268527105
after a phase in which extended procedures were favored , recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate .    2.8839453281801974
this is facilitated by modern fracture - reduction methods using indirect techniques .    2.805284754723789
a relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease - in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases - using a combined metabolic - electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio / coronary venous difference for lactate , UNK , free fatty acids and amino acids .    3.460770914296413
there are significant metabolic UNK between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest .    3.436011012929792
a 52 year old female with parry - romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back .    3.006496467593206
the disease process was limited to the c3 to t2 UNK on the right side .    3.356773100761072
in addition , there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to t10 , als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm .    3.1156774214673084
sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and UNK ; no progression was seen over several months using nmr to monitor the patient .    3.3663013037268747
the parry - romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways ; in view of this unusual case , we review the literature , attempting to provide a more accurate case definition .    3.6756922946131074
between 1990 and 1996 , 129 children ( mean age 4 . 8 years ) with hip pain were examined consecutively .    4.055412121144526
three patients who had synovitis developed perthes ' disease and were assigned to group ii .    3.2631253057089924
the efficiency of ultrasound , scintigraphy and mri as diagnostic tools was tested in the examination of painful hip .    3.3792654888602276
a capsular distension was present in 73 cases and showed a significant statistical difference ( t - test , p < 0 . 001 ) in group i between affected and unaffected hips .    3.3947852022405676
there were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group i between the affected and the non - affected side ( t - test , p = 0 . 91 , p = 0 . 57 ) and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow - up ( t - test , p = 0 . 053 , p = 0 . 75 ) .    3.3346715788521766
mri was performed , because of persistent joint effusion , in 10 cases in group i , and perthes ' disease was excluded .    3.9789852984343477
sonographic examination , together with x - ray examination and serological testing , represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow - up of transient synovitis .    3.8037867577451516
mri should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination , and when the x - ray does not allow a clear diagnosis .    3.8583849026441257
a 36 - year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one - vessel coronary artery disease ( 75 % proximal left main coronary artery ) for cabg and repair of the UNK .    3.2836357588422405
after induction , a transesophageal echocardiographic ( tee ) baseline examination was performed , showing a severely dilated coronary sinus ( cs ) measuring approximately 3 cm ( abnormal > 1 cm ) .    2.928134263242976
we suggested a persistent left superior vena cava ( plsvc ) draining into the cs .    2.9520668476443626
plsvc is a common venous congenital anomaly , with a reported incidence of 0 . 5 % in general population and in 3 - 5 % of patients with congenital heart defect .    4.42622180406433
injection of echo - contrast solution in a left arm vein , visualizing UNK UNK through the plsvc into the cs confirmed our suspicion .    3.0139018950331407
the diagnosis of a plsvc and dilated cs is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the plsvc resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection .    3.2149181367651334
it may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter ( pac ) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with UNK .    3.3504605995177816
a chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the pac along the left heart .    3.6574408598976924
teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features .    3.4779949813572704
the most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition , data transfer , data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate UNK units .    3.1184573518332073
a selection of commercially available teleradiologysystems is presented and compared .    3.609741397180904
UNK are the third frequent pediatric brain tumors .    3.127754494525664
complications after surgical treatment are common .    3.7863496147511437
the most frequent complications are endocrine disturbances , vision field defects , deteriorated acuity , cognitive or psychological deficiency as well as significant weight gain .    3.1854857187719543
a case of complete vision loss right after surgical removal of UNK is reported .    3.5633189656350353
magnetic resonance image showed an edema of the chiasm .    3.3093491838360154
seventeen days after surgery the patient reported intermittent visual impressions for the first time .    3.3213210723887525
over the following weeks his UNK improved to 0 . 5 , while the chiasm edema disappeared .    3.788386990623374
electron beam computed tomography ( ebct ) allows UNK and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries .    2.9935709003395536
this has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries .    3.072079682553545
ebct is , therefore , well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis .    3.5972653088037565
especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors , staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium , scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions .    3.0362548425503335
we report an unusual complication in a 53 - year - old woman following ileostomy for crohn ' s disease 22 years previously .    2.850094203325122
a stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele .    3.8315674422415125
to our knowledge , this is the first report of a ruptured mucocele of colonic origin after ileostomy .    2.280759472829185
the brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones .    3.650845579006262
estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems .    3.0952690855400613
initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia , particularly alzheimer ' s disease .    3.148121443294335
furthermore , estrogens may improve verbal UNK , memory , and mood in elderly women .    2.937621304466215
still , the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression .    3.765442039092692
a 38 - year - old male patient presented with circumscribed scleroderma ( UNK cm ) in the left pectoral area .    3.1259264862024008
UNK of the skin in the area of the lilac ring ( morphoea ) was quantified by means of laser - doppler flux ( ldf ) .    3.4738177369238077
at the lilac border of the morphoea ldf was increased to 420 % of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side .    3.564555778104997
immediately after 13 days of antibiotic therapy ( UNK UNK penicillin g per day , i . v . )    3.9567795537197394
ldf normalized , though clinical changes were hardly apparent at this stage .    3.1406624415297086
by 6 months later , ldf was still in the normal range , and clinical signs , such as induration and UNK UNK , had also significantly improved .    3.973852600239042
ldf measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged .    3.6794972997086624
it is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic UNK deformity with a cobb angle of between 25 ° and 40 ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected .    3.1603701482371114
the medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic ( oral , epidermal , intramuscular ) as well as the local ( intracavernosal , intraurethral ) application of pharma UNK agents .    3.0315629336315237
up to now only UNK , a well - known alpha - receptor blocking agent , and sildenafil , a newly introduced phosphodiesterase v inhibitor with predominant peripheral action , have been approved and listed in germany .    3.1377100288428443
other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine ( central action ) as well as UNK ( peripheral action ) .    3.1734830772005536
for the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit , the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options .    3.5545706133499952
for the local application of pharmacological agents , intracavernosal injection therapy and intraurethral application ( " UNK urethral system for erection " , UNK ) are available .    3.4325237574429996
currently , several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation .    2.8446439942603368
the ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and " tailored " therapy for each individual patient .    3.1202427046010768
while the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients , it will certainly be augmented by devices ( i . e . vacuum erection devices , " functional UNK of the corpus cavernosum " , UNK ) and surgical treatment options ( vascular and prosthetic surgery ) .    3.7506018526139244
we treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma ( ca .    3.0304255731347043
UNK cm ) on the right breast in a 48 - year old woman with photodynamic UNK ( pdt ) .    3.6372041045386903
fractionated pdt was performed by topical application of - aminolevulinic acid ( - ala , 20 % ) with subsequent red light ( UNK - 750 nm ; 180 j / cm2 ) in three sessions .    3.7539863531915834
nearly total remission of the tumor resulted ; however , a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple - areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis ( pdd ) .    3.527416392292698
these fluorescent areas were marked , excised , and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap .    3.5742906916878634
total excision of the tumor was verified histologically .    4.55390975848071
by combining pdt and surgery , this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results .    3.1640919987796567
this case demonstrates the efficiency of topical pdt with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by pdd even in large tumors .    2.997569260889162
in a prospective trial patients were interviewed in two periods , from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1995 .    2.934865955165721
ninety out of 189 patients ( 47 , 6 % ) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma who noted morphological changes in a pigmented lesion reported the mole had been present at least 10 years .    3.46786260115648
20 , 7 % stated it was present since birth .    3.7717357479939198
156 out of 189 patients ( 82 , 5 % ) noticed changes in the lesion over the time .    4.078050899805948
growth , UNK and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found .    4.3415648726798
bleeding and UNK were found with tumor thickness > 1 , 5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage .    3.821664347404845
almost 6 months passed until half of the patients visited a physician , either because of changes in the mole or in the lesion was detected during other medical examinations .    3.836642779042556
in the second period of the survey from 1993 to 1995 the physician was frequently consulted earlier .    2.856275657338912
the main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical UNK were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless .    3.388451558974905
only 72 out of 189 patients ( 38 , 1 % ) visited the physician on their own initiative .    3.5027691445268108
the primary evaluation of the " UNK lesion " was done by a primary care physician in 57 % , by a dermatologist in 32 % and by others in 11 % of our cases .    3.8009707072375716
a diagnosis of a non - melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27 % of the primary care physicians and 22 , 7 % of the surgeons , gynecologists or internists .    4.235621955333255
only 5 % of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions .    4.388671604351275
in the second trial period from 1993 to 1995 in all physician groups the rate of misdiagnosis increased due to changes in UNK services in the context of UNK in our health care system in east germany .    3.421674224718391
whereas 83 , 2 % of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first 2 months after consultation , the proportion for those diagnosed by non - dermatologists was only 58 , 5 % .    3.8377163021227236
the rate of primary treatment by surgeons , often with a small safety margin , also increased .    3.2005465102861312
in 45 patients with parkinson ' s disease , we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease - related data , locus of control , depression , and psychosocial adaptation .    3.3856978243410536
active , problem oriented , and self - UNK strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women ( age : 56 years ; duration of illness : 9 years ) .    3.055015431386868
while age and sex were not associated with coping , external locus of control correlated positively to " depressive coping " and duration of illness correlated negatively to " distraction and self - UNK . "    3.4442850651339914
coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction .    2.91498103985132
the internet has become a powerful , international source for information , and it has shown an exponential growth because of the ease of access and the immediate availability of information .    3.4443895016147756
we introduced a new ophthalmological atlas including icd coding on the world wide web .    2.99426758743873
so far , more than 500 UNK slides of typical and interesting ophthalmological findings have been selected and UNK .    3.1683174749235015
these pictures were integrated in a data base , which was arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval .    3.225732586190004
in its background , the data base contains a list of over UNK icd - encoded diagnoses to which the picture - documented findings are linked .    3.13582513898788
comments on pictures can be added by the author or by users .    3.0031183018025938
the data base contains several lists , such as a list of icd codes and diagnoses , a list of all pictures with corresponding diagnoses , a list of all diagnoses and number of picture , a list of those diagnoses for which the corresponding picture is available , as well as a list of comments on each picture .    3.0792770083817755
special program scripts handle the user ' s search key words for diagnoses and extract the required information out of the data base , using windows UNK .    3.1343980516624583
search results are presented on an automatically built - up UNK .    3.8141298196902635
to provide fast speed of search all pictures initially are shown in a small UNK ( UNK ) with little amount of data .    3.50973497862156
the related full - size picture is retrieved by a single mouse click .    3.1817836326381084
moreover , the name and institution of the author , UNK hints and comments on pictures by the author or by users are offered for each diagnosis available .    2.6287113609806014
the giessen ophthalmological picture atlas can be reached in the internet .    3.149801924513522
even though the function of the myometrium is vital for the existence of all mammals , there is little knowledge about its UNK .    3.4006928857005927
so far , only the contractile filaments actin and myosin have been identified .    3.0052278989086156
there is no evidence for the existence of other UNK systems , either my means of electron microscopy or histochemically .    3.0107478264298906
the indications , operative procedure , postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with " open " enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with crohn ' s disease .    3.1679879652137735
major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with crohn ' s disease are stenosis , UNK incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe crohn ' s UNK .    3.6956436053960164
most crohn patients tolerate laparoscopic enterostomy and an increasing number demand this minimally invasive technique .    3.2710623485889783
the period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized .    3.138884895765759
we report on a complete longitudinal rupture of the urethra in combination with a rupture of the pubic UNK and pelvic fracture during spontaneous vaginal delivery .    3.400371051969571
only after stabilisation of the pelvic fracture by external skeletal fixation adaptation of the urethra was possible .    3.3612555397754798
three weeks later after removing of the transurethral catheter a mild stress incontinence could be observed .    2.704415906017669
in the follow up one year later the patient was completely continent .    4.2823362000823035
the cosmetic result was satisfactory .    2.7353215136385516
an unclear haematuria after delivery needs a meticulous urological examination .    3.024813835068212
early repair of urethral disruption minimize the risk of severe incontinence .    3.304258427026338
coordinated care between the trauma surgeon and urologist is required for successful treatment of this rare combined injury after birth .    3.480096603470245
the increased consumption of " ecstasy " ( mdma , 3 , 4 - UNK - UNK ) has also increased the number of life - threatening intoxications .    4.055268285118714
from a medline search of the years 1992 - 1996 , reports were registered and evaluated .    2.992644038450522
besides cerebral , cardiorespiratory , renal , and hepatic symptoms , hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia , neuroleptic malignant syndrome , or the serotonin syndrome were common .    3.048850094451437
in addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive - care therapy , the psychological and physiological effects of " ecstasy " will be described .    3.23278830258781
some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review .    3.6307179382653243
the goal of this prospective , randomised and double - blind pilot - study was to investigate the analgesic potency and the side - effects of tramadol enantiomers in clinical practice .    3.0732829957856014
one hundred patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery with a postoperative pain intensity of more than 50 on a visual analogue scale 0 - 100 mm ( table 1 ) were recruited for the study .    3.538294426246325
they were treated in a randomised , double - blind way with a maximal dose of 150 mg i . v .    2.864224127748215
( + ) - , ( - ) - tramadol , racemate , or 15 mg i . v .    2.5316859209023748
morphine or saline in the placebo group ( 5 groups , 20 patients each ) .    3.537370655941319
the primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on vas after 40 min .    3.7585326899554254
in case of pain , responders were allowed to continue with the double - blind drug up to six hours .    3.4548735339136076
the non - responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic .    3.5780098691293536
the secondary criterium was the incidence and severity of side - effects .    3.7751499055514417
six patients terminated the study prematurely .    3.0293530816158647
one patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine , one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine , four were excluded because of protocol violations .    3.3394885389239666
there were 8 responders in the ( + ) - tramadol - , 6 in the ( - ) - tramadol - and 6 in the racemate group , 16 * ( p < 0 , 05 ) in the morphine group , and 5 in the placebo group .    3.1590555436219585
pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 ( p < 0 , 05 ) , 17 ( p < 0 , 05 ) , 17 ( p < 0 , 05 ) , 36 ( p < 0 , 01 vs placebo , p < 0 , 05 vs ( + ) - , ( - ) - tramadol , and racemate group ) and 5 mm on the vas in the ( + ) - , ( - ) - , ( + / - ) - tramadol - , morphine - and placebo - group , respectively .    3.0093910022256627
thirty eight adverse events like nausea , vomiting , pco2 - increase , and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients , most frequently in the ( + ) - tramadol - and morphine group .    3.143407860703233
sedation was significantly less profound in the ( - ) - tramadol group 1 - 4 h postoperatively .    3.510734523171732
there were no side - effect in the tramadol racemate group .    3.1854953005554285
the enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency , but inferior by far to morphine .    3.075171756520242
they showed more adverse events and , hence , can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy .    3.2089241448271815
a 36 - year - old man known as chronic alcohol UNK presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral UNK kidneys by sonography and computed tomography .    2.7649293750975414
because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits , tubular atrophy and UNK fibrosis .    2.9286610430885025
since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before , a secondary oxalosis was supposed .    2.8904494810709975
the subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of UNK UNK with UNK UNK 12 years before during the patient ' s UNK time as a UNK UNK .    4.216885675994372
such UNK contain ethylene glycol ( UNK ) as UNK commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria .    3.6487614047189334
the presented case , however , suggests a rare UNK ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage , oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy , interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure .    2.9749778567239056
undergoing chronic hemodialysis , the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure .    3.9687266541570465
at autopsy , progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed .    2.93903185821108
decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension .    3.000683826525719
insulinomas are rare tumors and account for 90 % of all endocrine pancreatic tumors .    4.077063459163846
they typically present as a solitary tumor , but may occur in multiple sites ( e . g .    3.4132963582770905
multiple endocrine neoplasia type i ) or as a malignant disease in 10 % of cases and rarely as UNK or islet cell UNK .    4.1166001297382735
UNK symptoms lead to the diagnosis ; inadequate high insulin and c - peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis .    3.2369497893434604
preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation .    4.272777764646824
the standard operation is enucleation or , depending on size and location , resection .    3.4437895534495673
subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection .    3.612661902696604
in malignant insulinomas , mostly presenting with liver metastases , aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking , UNK and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice .    3.520953077723304
mr spectroscopy is the only method for non - invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans .    3.7185229054074176
while the UNK nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for mr imaging , the mr spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei , such as 13c , UNK , UNK , 31p , UNK and UNK .    3.552462601885113
clinical applications presently are confined to the 31p nucleus .    2.9613755520448724
31p - mr spectroscopy allows the non - invasive study of cardiac high - energy phosphate metabolites atp and phosphocreatine .    3.4289749762065327
the phosphocreatine / atp ratio is considered an index of the UNK state of the heart .    4.073194080942339
possible clinical indications include heart failure , valve disease and coronary artery disease .    3.3017596422667674
in heart failure , the phosphocreatine / atp ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity , ejection fraction and prognosis .    3.058196156768703
in mitral and aortic valve disease , a reduced phosphocreatine / atp ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement .    2.996833226706058
in coronary artery disease , a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress ( " biochemical ergometry " ) may indicate local ischemia .    3.2097112487734414
furthermore , absolute quantification of high - energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability .    3.115895727868713
major technical developments , leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish mr spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool .    3.413331728604689
a retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome - related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto - orbital and midface advancement .    3.20680018167605
the file data of 293 children with fronto - orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of 4 . 4 years .    3.2596787299536802
in addition , lateral UNK of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed .    2.8618940121050445
moreover , late results of 36 children and 8 adults with midface - advancement with an average follow - up period of 4 . 5 years were assessed .    3.1965362026812967
in contrast to linear craniectomy and so - called lateral UNK advancement , in only 8 . 2 % of cases ( 24 out of 293 patients ) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto - orbital advancement .    3.4957563430149814
the evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as UNK and UNK predominantly very good or good growth can be observed .    3.2879735669153787
cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome - related UNK .    4.223188471524076
in such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia , which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes ` UNK - UNK - crouzon - UNK - UNK ' , could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto - orbital advancement .    3.2685830196537444
for this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies .    3.2043234145508697
in the present evaluation , a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references .    3.6673230437267055
therefore , the indication for le fort iii osteotomy in the growth period should be limited .    2.8961210276165645
the introduction of UNK into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task .    3.35667043995062
many recall the famous experiments from clark et al .    2.7308675466570285
in 1966 when he demonstrated " UNK with perfluorocarbons " in the mammal species for the first time .    3.042858444607356
after this hallmark , perfluorocarbons were subsequently introduced in research of acute lung injury by the techniques of total - and partial - liquid - ventilation ( tlv ; plv ) .    2.8264062286641822
perfluorocarbons ( saturated UNK ) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for UNK application .    3.306737861575805
the strong c - f UNK in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability , biochemical UNK , high capacity to UNK respiratory gases , low surface tension and high vapor pressures .    3.368379086905903
furthermore , the high density of the pfc lead to radio - opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas .    2.584041526499755
the efficacy of pfc liquid , applied by tlv / plv has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury .    2.972039813226855
currently , several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed : recruitment of atelectatic alveoli , prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ( " liquid peep " ) , redistribution of perfusion , oxygen transport , surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation .    3.036738393297033
since total liquid ventilation has been used only in experimental models of lung injury , partial liquid ventilation has been introduced successfully into clinical trials ( phase i - ii ) .    3.282233887203966
however , the results of the first randomised , controlled study of plv in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure ( ali / ards ) showed no differences between plv and conventional treatment .    3.4907499781127718
furthermore , the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as UNK , pneumothoraces and hypoxia .    3.11950560971331
since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen , the application of UNK , even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic .    3.470696562814104
to overcome these unwanted side effects , we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents .    3.4755150666433385
after resolving some technical issues , this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury .    3.101363864782236
vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 vol . % of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance .    3.045445596067728
though these results are promising , mechanisms of action , dose - efficacy relation , surfactant - perfluorocarbon interaction or anti - inflammatory effects of UNK perfluorohexane are still unclear .    3.226429584044446
these questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically .    3.6629031385632347
however , the inhalation of vapor , a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space .    2.5756691104181777
furthermore , this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing , continuous monitoring , and demand application in a way near to clinical routine .    3.248564654393592
vdd pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children .    3.300905401177065
we have used 6 different standard adult size single pass leads and 5 different pacemaker generators in 21 children and adolescents aged 3 . 7 - 17 . 2 years ( mean 9 . 9 years ) and weighing 13 . 5 to 76 kg ( mean 34 . 3 kg ) .    3.275471506770193
congenital complete heart block was present in 14 patients ( with associated heart disease in 2 of them ) , surgical complete heart block in 6 patients and 2 : 1 av block of uncertain cause in 1 patient .    3.5424035222410466
in 10 patients , the vdd system was their first pacing system .    3.3584684338345
in 11 of the patients , 1 - 6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads ( 10 ) and / or atrial leads ( 5 ) was performed .    3.956694943536146
all leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture ( using the extraction sheath when present ) and the atrial UNK was placed low in the right atrium to provide UNK for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing .    3.319089364992078
ventricular thresholds ranged from 0 . 2 to 0 . 8 v . the minimal atrial amplitude was 0 . 7 to 4 mv and the maximum amplitude was 2 . 5 to 8 mv .    3.992375546055413
there was one early micro - displacement and the lead was repositioned .    2.7972681487779205
over a follow - up period of 2 - 64 months ( mean 32 months ) , all but 1 of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise .    3.779939858501902
during this time some have undergone considerable growth .    2.9840778701176878
the standard adult size single pass lead provides a simple means to enable reliable atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in growing children with complete heart block .    2.723221739404323
open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures .    3.902528797739061
the internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws .    3.603870494935057
the use of cerclage wires and UNK as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature .    3.0491142247017367
the indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock .    3.2745482796960945
a newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone UNK is presented .    3.2692042784053674
it allows a safe , UNK application of a cerclage wire around the greater UNK notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach .    3.465285434609142
a wide dissection at the " outside " of the pelvis is not necessary .    3.5221414965773588
histological examination revealed a lichenoid , UNK infiltrative pattern , that could be distinguished from frank lymphoma by means of electron microscopy , immunohistochemistry and molecular biology .    3.2076575386019432
the presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal - allergic pathogenesis of non - granulomatous tattoo reactions .    3.0868066680248214
therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas .    3.533793350723856
interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils .    3.0972097329312342
in a series of 33 patients ( 34 procedures ) , we consistently used gianturco - coils which were the initially employed coils .    3.107222139724741
the rate of embolization was high ( 28 % ) in the first 14 procedures ; however , it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients .    3.9343093403705462
we modified the technique by partially blocking the duct , when necessary , with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils .    3.544110334904019
there was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients .    2.8555498631045224
the mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was 11 . 0 + / - 5 . 8 minutes and decreased to 7 . 0 + / - 3 . 2 minutes in the last 10 patients with successful closure .    3.906597060075819
considering our experience , we continue to recommend the use of gianturco - coils especially in the small duct which can be closed UNK at low cost .    4.041754796347277
this review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness .    3.045600089346256
UNK research , animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the UNK dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms .    4.1343520162948
furthermore , the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a UNK and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors .    3.072013555107646
although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades , current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation .    3.1859226796757065
athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude ( 1500 - 3000 m ) to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia - induced increase of the red blood cell volume and UNK at the muscular level .    3.3480723549723708
as maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude , it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work - UNK .    3.3993298585759075
furthermore , maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level .    2.859439392726313
to avoid these disadvantages at high altitude a concept of living at moderately high altitude and training at lower elevations , termed " live high - train low " evolved , opposing the conventional concept of " live high - train high " .    2.516839736707816
a third option using a UNK chamber ( " live low - train low " ) is hardly used anymore for training athletes .    3.0651920354470295
studies on the effects of conventional high - altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a UNK controlled design and yield controversial results .    3.11604979355019
regarding the new concept of " live high - train low " there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high - altitude training .    2.940320117372417
however , training concepts are especially important for UNK competitive athletes , and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform .    3.308734671467271
therefore , it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude - specific physiologic factors or non - altitude - related benefits of training UNK account for the success of individual athletes .    3.2469795488604345
purpose : to answer the following questions : whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low - field - mri - system ( magnetom open 0 . 2 t ) equipped with currently available hard - and software components in comparison to high field system ( magnetom impact 1 . 0 t ) .    2.902020886727774
patients and methods : in 11 patients , suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic mr - mammography acquired with high field system ( magnetom impact 1 . 0 t ) and were compared to low field mr - mammographies of 0 . 2 t ( magnetom open 0 . 2 t ) .    2.851507339327849
results : all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic mr - mammography ( magnetom impact 1 . 0 t ) were also clearly identified in the 0 . 2 t system ( magnetom open ) .    2.600640919700931
in six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of k 0 . 5 cm distance to the lesion .    3.639376528518331
conclusion : although studies in the 0 . 2 t system clearly showed inferior UNK ( 34 . 6 vs . 83 . 1 ) and UNK ( 14 . 6 vs . 43 . 5 ) compared to studies with the high field system , all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic mr - mammography were reliably identified also in 0 . 2 t studies .    3.3176334152403966
due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality , the magnetom open is suitable for interventions on the breast .    3.0885245171034805
children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development , because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration .    3.2780386801329593
supply them with a prosthesis , orthesis and UNK is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation .    3.6978664904002074
UNK compensate longitudinal malformations , have a supporting effect , allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening .    3.186526544867665
just as important as the UNK is early medical treatment .    4.157557639819633
the sooner the treatment starts , the better the results .    3.1830857618009527
as a result of the present experiences with the UNK application of nitric oxide ( no ) in term babies now the first promising reports about no application in preterm babies have been published .    3.1716306600195585
hiv remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions , the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs .    3.4030127910778645
hiv infectivity is easily destroyed by UNK .    3.1690367590074504
the human infectious dose of hiv is around 100 to 1000 particles , dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host .    3.160948606619245
after inoculation new hiv is produced after 24 hours , and hiv has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks .    3.3903574072614657
hiv infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays , and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays .    3.265727759509833
anti - hiv production might be slowed down under initial therapy .    2.86054557716585
in addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment , the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence .    3.0445716578107938
integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence .    3.134030123284424
in our study UNK alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between 2 to 3 weeks .    2.7952853798645148
a total of UNK patients ( 89 % ) were followed up after 8 months ; 242 alcoholics ( 52 % of the follow - up sample ; 46 % of the whole sample ) achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment , mainly as inpatients .    3.8488475638467357
fifty - four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment , but achieved abstinence afterwards ; 60 ( 25 % ) of these 242 patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy ; UNK alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy .    3.1047948727014516
in this UNK , 113 ( 50 % ) relapsed during the follow - up period .    2.963870083631495
although this is not a controlled study , it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence .    3.1870964155513506
in this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38 - year - old patient .    3.143003500593675
the initial diagnosis was " UNK vertebral disk " .    2.8595214257449864
although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations , it took almost 3 months until the real reason was found .    3.3530363448941203
in this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies .    2.871136489252697
neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus , also known as thymic UNK , are rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum .    4.722522171717165
they occur sporadically or in association with the men i syndrome .    3.03952079351292
we present five patients ( four male , one female ; age of first manifestation 19 - 53 years ) who were operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 1995 for neuroendocrine thymic tumors .    3.291973434384652
a hormone - producing tumor presented with UNK ' s syndrome in two patients .    3.7092535969130522
two patients had men i syndrome .    2.6669954409324528
only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus .    3.615946116165379
we found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one .    3.576366735529608
the neuroendocrine tumors have a high rate of local recurrences and thus we performed 11 operations using a transthoracic or UNK approach .    3.151143780094618
since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value , we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence .    3.785115559849484
korsakoff ' s psychosis ( wernicke - korsakoff - syndrome ) following severe , long - term alcoholism is considered to be widely resistent to treatment .    3.5364973080776174
we report two cases with beneficial effects of treatment by a combination of clonidine and UNK .    3.199573761471671
the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the UNK blockade of central dopamine d2 receptors .    3.610425125664032
brain imaging studies , however , generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central d2 receptors among schizophrenic patients .    3.691893394684362
using a novel approach , the group of UNK and UNK - UNK was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum .    3.819778690329319
endogenous dopamine UNK with a radioligand for binding at dopamine d2 receptors ; compared to healthy control subjects , blockade of dopamine production in neuroleptic - UNK schizophrenic patients induced a significantly higher increase in d2 binding of the infused radioligand , indicating higher endogenous synaptic dopamine .    2.9907099057110624
a similar increase in d2 binding was also observed in drug - free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics ; these patients also showed an increased density of striatal d2 receptors , most likely due to UNK upregulation of d2 receptors during neuroleptic medication .    3.029260308893071
the UNK study provides an important indication of UNK function in schizophrenia .    3.4688559228813993
multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare .    2.8741353159390948
there are only ten cases that have been previously described .    3.011604318142387
three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas , a so - called oncocytomatosis .    2.842557228912578
this report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy .    3.379728538903548
in addition , we found an adrenal adenoma , a pheochromocytoma and thoracic UNK 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung .    3.2340302977391118
immunhistochemically , these and the main oncocytomas were cd 10 negative .    3.4768753961457066
these findings support the origin of oncocytoma from UNK transformed distal tubular epithelium .    2.9582373145060457
cgh analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes .    4.492670541544682
coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare .    3.310516622966204
hitherto , coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described .    2.9792815833305824
thyroid disorders in childhood needing surgery are rare .    3.497130812304732
therapeutical procedures therefore are derived from adult surgery with modifications to meet the specific need of the pediatric patient .    3.0935299262242153
the indications for operation are presented with regard to incidence and type of the defect , and the surgical procedures with regard to the extent of the lesion results .    4.754709033444216
malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as , for example , lung cancer .    3.4776756867129426
however , well - established staging systems for non - osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors .    3.5823145763958775
therefore we present enneking ' s staging system for malign bone tumors here , which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical , radiological and histological findings .    2.979661780279872
the weak points of enneking ' s staging system ( e . g .    2.5483152052338207
UNK , changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years ) are discussed .    3.9170123015347786
efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction , acute occlusion of peripheral vessels , or dissection / perforation of major abdominal vessels .    3.520981304739383
it was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery .    3.504803553660831
patients were randomly allocated to eight groups , each receiving a different opioid within a clinical , equipotent dose range ( buprenorphine , fentanyl , morphine , nalbuphine , pentazocine , pethidine , tramadol , alfentanil ) .    2.771486710158597
a complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 min following opioid administration .    3.537694885025093
statistical evaluation was performed by 1 - and 2 - factorial anova ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.9951871108895736
significant time effects ( changes from baseline at the time of measurement ) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance , while significant group ( group - specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements ) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , stroke volume index , and pao2 .    3.555383183976409
no major effects were observed following morphine , fentanyl , alfentanil , tramadol , and nalbuphine .    3.268911517305612
pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in UNK and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression .    3.540692050108252
for interpretation of the results , factors such as respiratory depression , histamine release , secretion of endogenous catecholamines , and hypoxia - induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed .    3.501002148838019
tramadol , an opioid with moderate potency , seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects .    3.197474638375028
in this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic - assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) of the knee .    3.160986983268428
the tourniquet pressure was 360 mm hg and operation time was 1 . 75 h . after the operation the leg was UNK to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis .    3.8005274992026647
analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion .    3.6330435508305556
increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia .    3.78828513671837
due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia , the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day , where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with UNK pressure of over 100 mm hg was found .    3.2598487966312204
the compartment was released immediately .    3.1444249855497595
despite the appearance of severe muscle damage , no extensive débridement was done .    3.3072263112339617
at the second examination , at 48 h , there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis .    3.3469008380178704
clinically , there was complete palsy of the UNK of the foot .    4.49140768254616
the case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb , arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined .    3.0256709950841443
continuous epidural analgesia UNK the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome .    3.004845046785571
the influence of biomechanics in surgery of the locomotor apparatus has been constantly increasing over the last few decades .    3.036084079798601
the purpose of this study was to determine wether biomechanical studies can significantly influence therapy and treatment of shoulder injuries , especially shoulder instability .    2.97135484987333
the investigation was performed on 23 fresh human specimens with intact capsular ligaments of the glenohumeral joint .    2.814562030952817
a bankart lesion from 3 o ' clock to 6 o ' clock was repaired , and a bankart repair and anterior inferior capsular shift , as described by neer , were performed .    3.1845443197992704
the measurement was done on six clinically relevant positions of instability : superior , anterior , anterior - inferior , inferior , posterior - inferior , posterior .    2.925176957683895
measurement was done using a specially developed strain - gauge system .    3.0981122813535698
it was demonstrated that both instability and too much stability of the shoulder joint lead to a significant change in shoulder biomechanics .    3.502486404912446
the anatomical 0 - position of the glenohumeral joint in 110 ° of abduction is a position of about 60 ° of external rotation compared to the 0 - position for clinical measurement .    3.6448100284885756
from the therapy point of view , one has to ask for anatomical reconstruction instead of tight repair in soft - tissue repair in the glenohumeral joint .    2.900664597837892
immediate post - operative rehabilitation in a 60 ° range of motion is possible .    3.7326833756557556
a total of 61 patients suffering from weight loss and epigastric pain were screened by color flow duplex imaging ( cfdj ) of the abdominal vessels .    3.4530631242372976
criteria for diagnosis were ( 1 ) peak flow in the celiac axis ( ca ) of more than 200 cm / s ; ( 2 ) fixing of the ca stenosis during expiration and inspiration , and ( 3 ) steal phenomenon and reversal of flow in the superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) .    3.5582555499189215
results : of 61 patients 21 ( 34 . 4 % ) fulfilled the criteria ; 38 ( 62 . 3 % ) were excluded , and 2 patients could not be evaluated .    3.777849949797797
of 21 patients 10 were operated on after confirming diagnosis by angiography of ca and sma .    3.0664387620412326
conclusion : successful operative treatment of ca compression includes ( 1 ) cfdj of ca and sma proving stenosis persisting in UNK position of the diaphragm ; ( 2 ) angiography of ca and sma showing a steal phenomenon including blood flow reversal in sma ; ( 3 ) triad of symptoms : epigastric pain , UNK pain and weight loss ; and ( 4 ) exclusion of other causes , i . e .    3.222373964534987
pancreatic cancer , pancreatitis etc .    3.4171917705228476
extremely radical and radical surgical treatment of breast cancer was investigated with regard to indication , prognosis and local recurrence in comparison to current standard breast - conserving procedures .    4.272785608848771
plastic - reconstructive techniques and innovative therapeutical approaches such as preoperative chemotherapy can extend the indications for breast - conserving therapy without loss of oncological safety .    3.104286482090105
choosing individually various oncoplastic techniques such as glandular adaptation , local or distant flaps or mammoplasty permits breast remodeling with excellent cosmetic results .    2.82392458444021
we present the variety of UNK techniques and local flaps that enable the breast surgeon to achieve good symmetry and breast shape with minimal surgery and scarring .    3.047640180659717
lesions detected in the white matter by t2 - weighted mri are often inadvertently attributed to multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .    2.9475733370626367
patients with rheumatic diseases are commonly treated as an outpatient in their local environment or are referred to specialized centers .    3.1355092807583578
two recently founded daypatient clinics in berlin and frankfurt / UNK - main ( germany ) for patients suffering from rheumatic diseases will be evaluated for their medical outcome and cost - effectivness of comprehensive treatment of ra patients in stages of high inflammatory activity and progressive disability .    3.2420969160984408
the study design will be prospective , controlled , and randomized to compare outpatient and daypatient treatment .    2.758855590228419
the case - control study design with matched pairs within the network of collaborative arthritis centers will be used to compare daypatient and inpatient treatment .    2.7967465497439914
the paper contains a review of studies published in english or german language dealing with daypatient treatment of ra patients .    2.9521650039521083
a case of atrial ectopic tachycardia in an infant probably caused by a small tumor in the interatrial septum is presented .    3.312126561786959
the arrhythmia was successfully treated with amiodarone .    3.5676550131700946
several histologic abnormalities are known to cause aet , but an intracardiac tumor detectable by two - dimensional echocardiography is extremely rare .    3.1654920708680607
aet - especially in childhood - as well as cardiac tumors show a tendency to regression , so that even in this case medical treatment should be the first therapeutic choice .    4.56255026897039
interventional or surgical treatment is required just for those patients with aet that is resistant to medical treatment or UNK after finishing the medical treatment .    3.521828519713523
tonsure trichotillomania is a subtype of trichotillomania in which the scalp exhibits a UNK pattern of alopecia over the UNK , extending to the frontal margin and sparing the lateral margins and the UNK of the neck .    4.062237769532916
it differs from to the more common form of childhood trichotillomania in that predominantly female adolescents are affected and its incidence is related to quite severely pathologic psychodynamics , often with a disturbed relationship to female sexuality .    2.9816239506489266
the treating physician should be more UNK in assessing the prognosis ; hair UNK often continues for years .    3.2182220707234674
two patients with tonsure alopecia , associated in one case with trichotillomania of the pubic hair and in the other with enuresis , are presented .    3.674490575771303
the aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy .    3.852074979226702
bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( UNK ) before and after ovariectomy .    3.5311149915320623
histomorphometric measurements were done by a UNK system .    4.479443691871595
bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw .    3.0430378437129324
there is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long - term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials ( UNK ) .    3.396049975061803
for geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long - term care analogous - evidence is still lacking .    3.030365140041505
the nation - wide leading boards of the frg ' s sickness insurance administration in conjunction with its central medical service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation - wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long - term care insurance legislation " rehabilitation prior to long - term care " .    2.9387628583425736
these guidelines must be proven empirically .    3.224692482100654
to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the UNK ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service , the UNK design would be highly desirable .    4.242278612122347
unfortunately , the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid , reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium - term sensitivity to change do not yet exist .    3.183160752928964
nevertheless , there is a great and urgent need , for the first time , to investigate the cost - effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the frg , leaving aside the methodologic UNK of randomized control - groups .    3.1698806132890325
" idiopathic " ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis .    2.91859186375157
the underlying reasons and mechanisms of " idiopathic " ventricular tachycardias are still not completely understood .    2.9205022871936857
recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with " idiopathic " ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract , which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia .    3.9629287207770747
these described abnormalities were not uniform .    3.3530418410897096
this is the first report in which the origin of an " idiopathic " ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right - ventricular angiography , magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation .    3.281614815919086
fetal teratomas are extra - or UNK congenital malformations with different localization .    3.3646239359086803
although they are rare , they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed .    3.4512024538110238
if sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed , it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization , size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor .    3.6795623437822873
sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy .    3.0440138145928177
prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality , as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas .    3.2938106410374948
we report on a 62 - year - old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically .    2.8298416529163846
histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with UNK of histiocytes and so - called UNK - UNK bodies , leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon .    3.900450592306728
no other organs were found affected .    3.2002855214157937
in the course of an antibiotic therapy , there was no melena detectable over a period of six months .    3.5850703390743743
malakoplakia , an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract , is rarely found in the colon , with only 35 cases published until now .    3.7108930967375153
it is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders , immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse .    2.9733125121986497
this spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long - standing alcohol abuse was found as an UNK disease .    3.8795435530986877
unilateral UNK exanthem a ( ule ) is a self - limited , probably infectious - allergic skin disease UNK affecting small children .    3.4866086807582963
we describe five such cases .    3.070974889619082
the typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red , partly confluent papules and fine scales .    2.9598436812246267
two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ule .    3.3356613871659997
due to its asymptomatic course , therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases .    3.574529183123396
minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy .    3.3081985966914917
as in open surgery , several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described .    3.2147824271096983
in principle , one must distinguish between the laparoscopic and the retroperitoneoscopic access .    2.8462069322056354
all adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically .    2.801736744137707
however , the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors .    4.11117856578184
the results reported to date are convincing .    3.3577110659636857
only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy .    3.512640238803556
because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare , endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that , for the present , will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery .    3.760458551895501
economic evaluations have become more and more important in the UNK field .    4.337381277013406
this survey ' s objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy .    3.43578297679242
8 data UNK , 17 key words from the psychotherapeutic field and 14 economic key words were used , the identified original studies were classified in accordance with UNK , the methodical quality of each study was assessed at a score between 0 and 10 points .    3.551100830935088
21 studies were found : 16 cost - benefit analyses , 4 cost - effectiveness analyses and one cost - utility analysis .    3.258348137001933
the quality of the representation of the clinical results ( mean value 8 . 6 ) was better than that of the economic results ( mean value 6 . 1 ) .    3.7647004105758546
it was perfectly possible to evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions with regard to economic aspects by means of the current techniques but in most cases there was a considerable lack of quality in both representation and calculation .    3.9470988383389476
furthermore the evaluation type of cost - utility analysis , which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and UNK seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field , has been greatly UNK .    3.7190571034431845
as a net effect of ace - inhibitors and at1 - receptor antagonists on the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) UNK due to UNK ( reduction of blood pressure , afterload reduction ) , antiproliferative ( reduced cell growth , reduction of " vascular " UNK " ventricular remodeling " , reduced formation of extracellular matrix ) , as well as UNK actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis , reduction of blood pressure , preload reduction can be expected .    3.378550890807618
these aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ace - inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction , no comparable data are available for at1 - receptor antagonists .    3.557096975416696
to date , an antithrombotic and UNK action could only be demonstrated for ace - inhibitors .    3.19308061551231
this effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long - term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease .    3.6739909754063484
despite the similar spectrum of action there exist important differences between ace - inhibitors and at1 - receptor antagonists that might underline the need of an individual use of these drugs : the dual action of ace - inhibitors on the ras and the kinin system bears many benefits but has been also shown to be accompanied by side - effects , mainly chronic dry cough , in a relatively high percentage of patients thus leading to discontinuation of therapy in 8 - 14 % .    3.0474004698806523
this respective side - effect can be prevented by the use of at1 - receptor antagonists .    3.54676253908462
it has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ace - inhibitors on at1 - receptor - mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high ( 75 - 80 % ) as compared to other substances .    3.4472684453313067
a combination of the ace - inhibitor - mediated activation of the kinin - system with the more specific blockade of at1 - receptors by at1 - receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation .    2.999406992528612
finally , it has been discussed that the UNK at ii concentration in case of at1 - receptor - blockade activates UNK - receptor - mediated mechanisms thus leading to an additive UNK effect .    3.596768201198795
an isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease - specific skin reaction .    3.227938950058186
we report on the development of the koebner phenomenon in a 32 year old patient with psoriasis after skin testing with uvb at a dose above 0 , UNK j / cm2 .    3.315841216599212
in addition we describe a 28 years old patient who developed new psoriatic plaques in the areas affected by the virus after a varicella infection .    3.417797673089179
the presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non - UNK exposed to tobacco smoke after 4 h to 8 days of nicotine - free time was investigated .    3.022850718570328
following stimulation of the eccrine glands , sweat samples were taken every hour for 6 h . the total nicotine concentrations , i . e .    3.0743831763574114
the sum of nicotine and its metabolites , were determined by radioimmunoassay .    3.332104899510497
the presence of unchanged nicotine was revealed by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry .    2.6915772534326536
up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis ( ic ) , since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown .    2.8788448902107944
most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized , double - blinded or placebo - controlled .    3.385580595969184
numerous case reports and intent - to - treat trials are lacking a systematic approach and do not meet evidence - based medicine criteria .    3.411425064976735
consequently there is as yet no standard oral therapy available for the treatment of ic .    3.6664735929497176
differential UNK induced by 2 - UNK - d - glucose ( 2 - dg ) is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy .    4.072711958189618
our earlier work on ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2 - dg .    2.721336792075473
moreover , the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more UNK and less reversible .    2.955853877871459
the promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2 - dg has been further evaluated in the ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response .    3.224039972704061
solid tumors ( average volume = 0 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 cm3 ) implanted in swiss - UNK strain " a " mice were focally irradiated ( 10 gy ) using UNK teletherapy .    3.3900316803089425
tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31p mr spectroscopy .    3.4776249129865233
the uptake and phosphorylation of 2 - dg was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives .    2.9430311312657853
upon hematoporphyrin derivatives + 2 - dg treatment followed by UNK , the intracellular ph reduced and a remarkable increase in UNK and inorganic phosphate levels was observed .    3.7988480632655133
the present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2 - dg in a mice ehrlich ascites tumor model .    2.968465770299486
the finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation - induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors .    3.860910698663561
the novel UNK ( UNK ) by the german author , social UNK and physician georg büchner ( 1813 - UNK ) can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine .    3.8203332208439145
on the one hand , büchner ' s description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria ; on the other , he hints at the physician ' s modern general attitude toward the patient .    3.009699823726097
the latter is derived from his UNK of art and political motives .    2.8330574201528966
the hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may UNK the pain of fibromyalgia .    3.35184545694632
data from animal UNK show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to ( 1 ) increase in ongoing activity , ( 2 ) lowering in stimulation threshold , and ( 3 ) increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons .    3.4604215341062217
the influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors .    2.6892085129608985
if similar changes occur also in patients , an impairment of the UNK active descending system should be followed by ( 1 ) spontaneous pain ( ongoing activity ) , ( 2 ) UNK ( lowering in mechanical threshold ) , and ( 3 ) hyperalgesia ( increased responses to noxious stimuli ) .    3.853408877279749
these changes should affect mainly deep pain , because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors .    2.862003169026367
clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2 . 5 years observation .    3.672201289087255
the present trial was continued in order to determine the long - term behavior of ionomer cement ( UNK partial and total ossicles ) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain .    3.743856981337664
the ossicular chain was reconstructed in UNK cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles ( i . e . , incus , incus and malleus , incus and stapes superstructure , and malleus , incus and stapes superstructure ) .    2.7837986604768448
follow - up extended over a maximum period of 5 . 5 years .    3.5048169191267613
patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure - tone UNK was performed at regular intervals .    3.424525069737137
preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) is not presently performed in germany .    2.8711309857487097
according to pgd ' s UNK there , existing laws for the protection of embryos UNK this type of diagnostics .    3.393425717517296
this controversy has hindered pgd ' s application in germany .    3.0139014589094733
the nature of this longstanding , emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad .    3.226531093620565
no bone grafting was performed .    3.4716464149117545
all cases were documented with antero - posterior and lateral x - rays preoperatively , 0 , 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation .    3.5667748857492434
early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery .    3.2379568402117487
thirty - six fractures showed a dorsal comminution , combined with osteopenia in 18 cases .    3.053506604787288
the mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively .    2.6822814357224796
the mean preoperative volar angle of UNK 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively .    2.9354875319409572
none of these mean angles changed until consolidation .    3.0282468825254374
the external fixator was removed on average after 7 weeks ( range 6 - 10 weeks ) depending on the radiological fracture healing .    3.2667486426357133
the small ao external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist .    2.9708608259600617
its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication ( unstable colles type with one or two distal fragments ) .    3.2532072816717936
bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation .    3.0506790633879617
purpose : to develop and implement a method to obtain digital subtraction ( ds ) spiral computed tomography angiograms ( scta ) in order to avoid UNK of bony structures and vascular calcifications on scta maximum intensity projections ( UNK ) and UNK surface display ( ssd ) .    3.0789430700189944
the concept of small - volume resuscitation , the rapid infusion of a small volume ( 4 ml / kg bw ) of hyperosmolar 7 . 2 - 7 . 5 % saline solution for the initial therapy of severe UNK and shock was advocated more than a decade ago .    3.8347767181564896
numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure , cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre - shock values .    3.585313296084652
most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality .    3.636261737336416
a meta - analysis of preclinical studies from north and south america , however , has indicated an increase in survival rate by 5 . 1 % following small - volume resuscitation when compared to standard of care .    3.698616864297329
moreover , small - volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased icp and in UNK trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention .    3.7055589910578104
the utility of electron beam computed tomography ( ebt ) to estimate cerebral blood volume ( cbv ) and cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) was evaluated .    3.1047929472341154
eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated .    3.0851934051169096
the ebt was performed with an acquisition time of 50 ms per slice at eight parallel levels .    3.2386154931135467
to compare signal / noise and contrast / noise ratios the data from the ebt investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral ct .    3.3281354978234505
the signal / noise ratio with ebt was about 30 % , the contrast / noise ratio 25 % of that with spiral ct .    3.527887009773504
the absolute values of cbv were 4 . 9 + / - 1 . 2 ml / 100 g ( ebt ) ; cbf was 50 . 5 + / - 7 . 0 ml / 100 g / min in normal contralateral brain tissue .    3.2435470280478893
in four patients with proven infarcts on follow - up , the ischemic areas had a cbv ranging from 1 . 7 to 3 . 8 ml / 100 g , while cbf ranged from 9 . 4 to 24 . 5 ml / 100 g / min .    3.472735520881993
using a bolus injection of contrast material , calculation of absolute cbv and cbf is feasible using ebt .    2.8435121544638746
advantages of ebt are the absolute measurements possible and it ' s multislice capability .    3.1541809944087613
disadvantages , however , are caused by the high image noise , limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue .    3.954526132268246
the report , in two parts , sums up the findings of a survey covering 52 cities in central europe .    3.2327402443239133
most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street UNK , but this has been more or less unsuccessful .    3.2868375861339905
information campaigns were used on a large scale , along with more controversial methods such as catching the UNK or shooting them down , providing UNK UNK , administering hormone preparations , UNK , and exclusion from buildings .    3.6400212796442
few attempts were made to reduce the number of breeding places .    3.6608978430298067
population reduction by poisons or natural UNK seems to be negligible .    3.5256494147214466
we report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was UNK through the UNK into the front seat .    3.1581703452373033
apart from the high speed ( 100 km / h or more ) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular UNK mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle .    3.1973131682936615
in addition , the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident .    3.2152154806748254
a 41 - year - old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from UNK hypothermia after loss of UNK in diabetic ketoacidosis .    3.149774223068673
the patient received mechanical ventilation , fluid therapy , warmed gastric lavage , and , unfortunately , inotropic medication .    3.0801448512659646
she was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) .    3.3338830443539793
on arrival , the patient had a rectal temperature of 27 . 3 °c , the ecg showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70 / min , and the blood pressure was 63 / 43 mm hg .    4.0011725254100385
we decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive UNK hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient .    3.1367864908676233
the hemofiltration system ( gambro UNK - 10 , gambro ab , sweden ) was instituted with a blood flow rate of 200 ml / min .    3.1111103410531618
the hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and UNK fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to 40 °c .    2.7636113125533583
sinus rhythm resumed without antiarrhythmic medications at a temperature of 29 . 5 °c , and within 8 h the patient was UNK to 35 . 5 °c .    3.7729733239843144
after treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia , she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage .    3.261412936332417
we conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved .    2.9737232049246973
under these circumstances , it is preferable to external rewarming techniques , as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature UNK and rewarming shock .    3.642964406253131
rewarming rates of 1 . 5 °c / h seem to be adequate .    4.136963727764922
hemofiltration systems are more widespread , less invasive , and easier to handle compared to cpb techniques , which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures .    3.319451021111736
we report an unusual injury of the face caused by the spoke of an automatic UNK umbrella that come loose when the umbrella was opened .    3.265980886852159
due to the shot - like force of the spoke , the left UNK , septum and right wall of the nasal cavity were UNK .    3.336567630593991
the part with the joint UNK into the maxillary antrum .    3.5707567607863324
in order to remove the spoke , wire UNK had to be used to cuff off the spoke ' s joint inside the surgically opened maxillary sinus .    3.152523045756273
seven patients with pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma were treated with inhalation therapy with 36 million iu interleukin - 2 for six months .    3.5264217608167794
inhalation therapy was combined with four bolus infusions of UNK at a dose of UNK mg / m2 once every four weeks .    3.781764627191889
therapy was well tolerated with low toxicity .    3.269879068116634
six of the patients developed cough ; one patient was slightly feverish .    4.165898255082107
we conclude that inhalation therapy of lung metastases is a promising addition to the therapeutic arsenal against malignant melanoma .    3.357812701408668
twelve patients with extensive lichen planus , resistant to different regimes of prior external and internal therapy , were treated with puva - bath photochemotherapy ( UNK bath followed by uva irradiation ) using bath water containing 0 , 5 mg / l of 8 - UNK ( 8 - mop ) .    3.362729819441313
in 11 of the 12 patients , the skin lesions showed a significant improvement or even complete remission within six weeks of treatment .    3.5436829664443197
in one patient , only limited clinical improvement could be achieved .    3.0034308347866756
a mean of 19 , 1 ( sd + / - 3 , 6 ) puva - bath treatments were carried out .    3.4379151693524737
the mean cumulative uva - dose given until clearance of the lichen planus was 16 , 7 ( sd + / - 4 , 8 ) j / cm2 .    3.070386812271119
no side effects were seen except an increased UNK reaction in two patients manifested as slight erythema .    3.449969912374414
the results of this trial show , that puva - bath photochemotherapy with 8 - mop is an effective therapeutic alternative to all other known therapies in the treatment of extensive , UNK and also hypertrophic - hyperkeratotic lichen planus .    3.4125896374600466
in comparison to oral puva therapy and puva - bath therapy using 4 , 5 ' , 8 - UNK , balneophotochemotherapy with 8 - mop shows an excellent efficiency - side effect correlation .    3.2117400739912103
the clearance of the refractive skin lesions by balneophotochemotherapy with 8 - mop demonstrates the superiority of this therapy over all other common therapeutic modalities used for lichen planus .    2.8213256942364873
critical illness polyneuropathy ( cip ) may occur in up to 70 % of septic patients and multiple organ failure patients .    3.9445952113295784
typical clinical signs of cip are the difficulty to wean the patient from artificial respiration , a symmetrical UNK UNK / - UNK that is more pronounced in the distal parts of the limbs , reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes , and muscular atrophy .    3.517688020779881
this article describes and discusses the clinical and electrophysiological features and clinical outcomes , UNK concepts , therapeutic implications , and the complex differential diagnosis of cip from a neurological point of view , focusing on disorders of the nervous system and myopathic abnormalities .    3.514048525673445
the data available in the literature were reviewed and compared to our own findings in order to UNK a clinical definition of cip .    4.401469390527549
it is a particular aim of this work to emphasize the crucial importance of electrophysiological investigation and monitoring in the classification of the nature and extent of neuromuscular disturbances in critically ill patients .    3.279458252020565
myths about development during midlife are examined in the light of recent research studies .    3.25571876964378
these studies show clearly , that midlife is a developmental phase of its own , the course of which can only slightly be predicted by previous development .    3.3351738474023858
the assumption of a depressive crisis automatically occuring must be rejected as well as " positive myths " denying the evolving limitations in certain areas of life .    3.0223991419588656
developmental tasks and developmental possibilities are described as well as the clinical concept of a phase - specific " return of the repressed " .    3.6583744014781994
possibilities of UNK and psychotherapy with couples during midlife are outlined .    3.3666476000225347
the general aspects for the analysis of malalignment of the low tibial region in the three - dimensional space are discussed .    3.428372931379668
recommendations for clinical and radiological diagnostics prior to low tibial osteotomies are given .    3.3388104182460037
closing wedge , opening wedge , dome - shaped , distraction , rotational and step - shaped osteotomies as well as combined procedures are described .    3.4249189187697144
the possibilities of these techniques are pointed out for malalignment after lower leg , pilon and ankle fractures , as well as after trauma of the distal epiphysis of the tibia .    3.682147987321068
arthroscopy of the ankle is an additional tool for detailed planning of the adequate surgical procedure .    3.2560918578389995
the importance of determining an early correction cannot be underestimated .    2.9076278577331465
the original reason for using the german " habilitation " degree to mean that a UNK had qualified and could UNK research and teach at a university is no longer really valid , as this is being threatened by its importance to further UNK .    3.1033156467844867
medical faculties must discuss how this development can be UNK .    3.277131129634108
in order to check the current situation , the habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of german universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system .    3.092599493510053
conformity existed only in the demand for a UNK UNK , scientific publications and a lecture on approval .    4.3578889577556
concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order : habilitation thesis , UNK to teaching , further professional education , participation in UNK , UNK lecture , qualification to teach , scientific activity , broad background in the discipline , and introduction to the UNK .    3.210618984523729
application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15 . 2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points .    3.8825867912895005
a significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the habilitation degree ( p = 0 . 002 ) .    3.304798631082271
even if scoring systems are ambiguous and UNK , our analysis revealed serious differences in the quality of the habilitation degree .    3.665532793767051
presuming that the german habilitation degree should be maintained as a high - level qualification , we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination .    3.7260621190137173
chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation ( iugr ) .    2.6598998675832815
in an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced iugr was examined .    2.6434234218824844
pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable UNK on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation .    3.5471879155726582
flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements .    3.1834600527866748
when the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained , uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals .    3.03755241851414
body weight and UNK index in fetuses of flow - restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls .    3.116725950411556
umbilical blood flow in iugr animals was lower than in controls .    3.3169427111461016
the relation between uterine and umbilical blood flow became closer with advancing gestational age .    2.6290096724075864
chronic reduction of uterine blood flow in late pregnant sheep causes iugr accompanied by changes in umbilical blood flow which may be due to fetal adaptation .    3.1219830229425978
four hundred and eighty - eight radical UNK prostatectomies ( rrp ) were performed on clinically localized prostate cancer at one institution within 5 years ( 1992 - 1996 ) .    3.0380904189251865
these were then analyzed regarding the migration of pathological tumor stages towards more localized stages .    2.757232569583768
within the observation period , the annual rate of rrp increased by 81 % from 69 to 125 cases .    2.987341676956775
the authors noted a decline in the occurrence of advanced tumor stages ( 65 . 0 % to 39 . 2 % ) and small cancers ( < 0 . 5 cc : 7 . 2 % to 1 . 6 % ) and an increase in pathological t2 tumors ( 30 . 4 % to 55 . 2 % ) .    4.114232245968565
the rate of positive surgical margins declined from 34 . 7 % to 12 . 8 % ( for all pathological stages ) .    3.52358457981208
these data confirm trends which were observed in the usa with increasing detection and treatment of localized prostate cancer .    3.6500680580867217
prognostic assessment of acute global cerebral UNK following cardiorespiratory arrest UNK high level of clinical and technical diagnostic skills .    3.589616468100373
statements regarding prognosis of this form of coma can be made only with reference UNK large number of clinical , neurophysiological , biochemical , and cerebral imaging data .    3.7175273423417603
previous research in this field has usually been restricted to only one or a few parameters such as clinical data , eeg findings , evoked potentials or biochemical markers .    3.172262748588501
the present compilation of the various aspects regarding diagnosis and prognosis is intended to define the present state of the art in diagnosis and prognosis of anoxic coma , and also serve as a basis for a multicenter prospective study including all of the relevant data to improve diagnosis and UNK at guidelines for effective UNK of anoxic coma .    3.488677755721264
in 96 patients ( ductal pancreatic carcinoma , n = 34 ; periampullary carcinoma , n = 43 ; chronic pancreatitis , n = 19 ) the role of ca 19 - 9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated .    3.836587891764096
the sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73 . 3 % , for periampullary carcinoma 48 . 8 % , and specificity was 63 . 2 % .    3.863018839433829
UNK antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient .    3.3403661747857463
even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed .    2.8035954907473863
the low specificity of 63 % , which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice , does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis .    3.8587454783758477
in cases of postoperatively elevated ca 19 - 9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers .    3.436430445012239
the management of neuromuscular foot deformities in children and adolescents must be individualized because of differences in etiology and UNK .    3.0237600817177337
if conservative treatment fails or reaches a plateau early soft tissue procedures are recommended .    2.7125704313686247
treatment should focus not only at correction of the deformity but also at UNK of muscular balance .    3.216088893432679
regular clinical follow - ups help to minimize postoperative problems .    3.3089278398816258
the general aim should be an optimization of functions and only rarely to achieve a normal foot .    3.48532242952343
the basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity , stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power .    3.156660198025564
this study was carried out from 1986 to 1996 to evaluate the technique of UNK epidural endoscopic discectomy in lumbar hernias occupying over 50 % of the radicular canal , foraminal hernias , and hernias invading it entirely .    3.3564618191314928
this minimally invasive arthroscopic technique was applied in patients suffering from degenerative lumbar stenosis between l3 and s1 .    3.1775073342614304
the first part of the study dealt with lumbar hernias .    3.249250941595304
of a total of 222 patients , 175 ( 78 . 82 % ) showed radicular canal invasion ranging between 50 and 90 % .    3.3845472447392475
the disc level was l4 - l5 in 59 % , l5 - s1 in 39 % , and l3 - l4 in 4 % .    3.1546783371519034
most of these hernias were lateral extrusions .    2.787861589685327
however , the study also included protrusions and foraminal hernias , since they were large and technically difficult to operate on .    2.8009825814051523
in terms of distribution , 25 patients ( 14 . 28 % ) had protrusions and 120 ( 68 . 57 % ) extrusions , and in 30 patients ( 17 . 14 % ) hernias had UNK .    4.099961439036615
surgery was carried out by the UNK posterior approach through the UNK ligament .    4.118243250561768
an irrigation pump was used and the structures were under permanent accurate arthroscopic visualization .    3.0255807769978706
good results were obtained in 96 % , fair in 3 % , and poor in 1 % .    3.9062547665134075
the second part of the study dealt with lateral stenosis .    3.1324152623466515
drawing from the experience gained by experiments performed in 1993 on five cadavers and by UNK epidural endoscopy since 1986 , this surgical technique was designed to provide decompression by resection of the ventral zone of the articular facet and , in some cases , UNK .    3.4476167618362994
of the 19 patients treated , nine presented with pathology in one segment , nine in two segments , and one in three segments .    3.33489531035653
all had lumbar and sciatic complaints , intermittent neurological claudication and predominantly lateral sensory motor deficit .    2.734510759545841
the general results were good in 84 % and fair in 16 % .    3.3393525104308286
the effects of " care - insurance " on the situation of those in need of home care , is the object of first implementation - studies of sgb xi .    3.0682770676084536
they largely agree on the high level of satisfaction found among those who draw the benefits of the insurance scheme , particularly among those who claim a UNK UNK ; further they largely agree on the low level of influence of the " care - insurance " on changes in the form of nursing .    3.3792135579356466
an account of the results of the milieu - oriented " freiburger UNK " , which investigates the effects of " care - insurance " differentiated according to the various types of care - situations , forms the centre of the article .    3.507214079579954
a possible intraoperative complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is opening of the gallbladder with subsequent loss of gallstones .    3.2949260795409914
we report on a 61 - year - old woman who was UNK with an obscure subhepatic tumor .    2.50310361311673
intraoperatively an abscess was found that had been caused by lost gallstones following after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 years previously .    3.3710726190722906
there is a low incidence of late abscesses caused by loss of gallstones , but because of the long latency and unspecific symptoms there may be problems in diagnosis .    3.581369195358998
taking into consideration possible complications caused by intraoperative loss of gallstones , all concrements should be retrieved , even though there is no indication for changing to an open procedure .    2.92301883531199
since squamous cell UNK of the penis is rare , prospective trials do not exist .    3.7124200823422067
therefore , new treatment strategies have to be developed .    3.7328447221108116
based on our experience with the treatment of 22 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma , we describe our therapeutic approaches .    3.8225943038588635
ten patients with superficial disease ( t1 - UNK ) were treated with partial penectomy .    4.000700424062682
the 3 - year survival rate amounted to 90 % .    3.335234048877128
in patients with extensive disease ( t3 - 4 or n1 - 3 ) a partial or total penectomy was performed .    3.2797941009523295
after initial antibiotic therapy for 4 weeks , patients underwent inguinal lymph - node dissection and if the nodes were positive , additional pelvic lymph - node dissection .    3.3831614120770865
in patients with UNK inguinal lymph - node metastases surgical resection was performed , covering the wound with a musculocutaneous flap ( UNK fascia lata flap n = 2 ; rectus abdominis flap n = 1 ) .    3.162838311213914
the 3 - year survival rate of patients with t1 - UNK tumours ( n = 4 ) was 67 % and with t3 - UNK - 3 ( n = 8 ) 25 % .    4.279195655412419
patients with distant metastases received inductive systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin , methotrexate and bleomycin .    2.908965170560895
objective responses occurred in 22 % ( 1 cr , 1 pr ) of 9 patients .    3.2787869039179927
these results suggest that immediate radical surgery with lymph - node dissection is the best treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis .    3.1252257410770086
biomechanical investigations in eight specimen elbow joints to test articulated external fixation showed correct extension - flexion joint position between 0 and 120 ° .    2.8931750310966553
the central axis through the radial and ulnar condyles varies less than 3 ° in total .    3.0376235530123097
x - ray UNK showed correct articulation in all cases without subluxation .    3.662739313403685
in six patients with persistent subluxation and complex fracture of the proximal ulna external fixation with an additional articulation was placed .    3.743194015693343
all patients began with physiotherapy on the 3rd day after operation , the range of joint motion was 0 - 30 - 95 ° in all cases , after 6 weeks 0 - 30 - 110 ° .    3.2973964923551744
additional articulated external fixation at the elbow joint can be an alternative treatment to long - term UNK of the elbow in cases of complex injury .    4.512832661742237
how important and UNK are clinical parameters and locoregional failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the probability of the occurrence of distant metastases ?    3.8851781824975276
from 1 august 1990 to 1 october 1998 , 139 patients with carcinomas of the oropharynx were treated in a prospective study by radical radiotherapy and evaluated in regard to the clinical parameters reflex - otalgia , predominant structure of tumor growth , t - category , presence of involved lymph nodes , and smoking and drinking habits .    3.2558259034603565
twenty - nine patients received a concomitant chemotherapy .    3.100647224786599
twenty - five out of 139 patients had a planned neck dissection after completion of radiotherapy .    3.207263294241545
ten patients received a salvage operation .    3.4336103978477017
two - and 5 - year overall survival rates according to kaplan meier were 56 . 1 and 49 . 6 % .    3.434442255595687
the tumors were controlled in 77 / 139 patients ( 55 % ) .    2.974759211820935
the therapy failed in 62 / 139 patients ( 45 % ) .    2.720498869539232
both groups , 62 patients with locoregional therapy failure and 77 patients with locoregionally controlled tumors , were comparable in regard to performance status ( UNK index ) , age , gender , tnm - categories , histological differentiation , drinking habits , pretherapeutic diagnostics , total dose ( gy ) , and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles .    3.401524882929716
locoregional tumor control was significantly determined by the parameters reflex - otalgia ( p < 0 . UNK ) , predominant growth pattern ( p < 0 . 012 ) , t - category ( p < 0 . 03 ) , and smoking ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    3.461169519109698
the median survival time of patients with locoregional failure is 17 months .    3.3975168002253557
at this moment 81 % of locoregionally controlled patients are still alive .    3.0937971955396444
in 14 / 62 patients ( 23 % ) with locoregional failure , distant metastases were detectable against 4 / 77 ( 5 % ) of locally controlled patients , p < 0 . UNK .    3.407126056264921
probability of local control and distant metastases , predominantly pulmonary , reached a plateau after 24 months .    3.305539078377231
locoregional tumor control , determined by several clinical parameters , is an important parameter for the probability of the development of distant metastases .    4.2265740014452495
telemedicine includes all medical activities in diagnosis , therapeutics , or social medicine undertaken by means of an electronic transfer medium , enabling the transmission of visual and acoustic information over long distances to doctors not UNK present at the place of the requested consultation .    3.119767429252678
the aim of this study was to evaluate the retropatellar pressure , force , and contact area in cases of knee arthroplasty compared to knees without arthroplasty .    2.7031115156490224
we examined six leg specimens before and after knee arthroplasty .    3.272473768994809
the modified UNK fixation was used , and arthroplasty was the genesis i without patellar implant ( UNK .    3.150703003592523
smith & nephew , UNK ) .    3.436856282098384
contact measurements were performed with pressure - sensitive film ( fuji UNK type " super low " ) in 45 ° , 60 ° , 90 ° , and 120 ° knee flexion .    3.1931597871509276
the results were evaluated with special software , " pressure imaging and analyzing system UNK - UNK series " .    3.513842341751229
the leg was UNK in the hip joint and the knee joint was opened from a suprapatellar approach .    3.8672701694016887
the film was placed at a defined area between the facies UNK of the femur and facies UNK of the patella .    4.144646546253404
instantaneous pressure was measured during a time of 5 - s pressure increase and a further 5 s . a force of 280 n was applied to the quadriceps muscle .    3.7497531393371926
before knee arthroplasty , the contact area measured 154 . 3 mm2 , the average pressure was 1 . 14 mpa , the force 182 . 13 n . after knee arthroplasty , the contact area was 119 . 94 mm2 , the average pressure 1 . 522 mpa , the force 180 . 98 n . following knee arthroplasty the contact area decreased significantly ( p = 0 . UNK ) , and the average ( p = 0 . 0001 ) and maximum pressure ( p = 0 . 0003 ) increased significantly .    2.9808511635156427
the force did not change significantly ( p = 0 . UNK ) .    2.663735131249764
the choice of the knee arthroplasty implant and approach to the knee joint should be considered in order to achieve an increased retropatellar contact area thus preventing smaller contact areas than before knee arthroplasty .    3.601344235030883
the increased contact area could also prevent increasing retropatellar pressures after knee arthroplasty and further complications .    2.877160379136356
maculopathy occurring in young patients is a challenge in UNK diagnosis .    3.672377987943926
besides hereditary macular UNK and acquired macular UNK , rare systemic disorders should be considered .    2.9913244983862284
histological examination of UNK biopsies ( 2 - 5 mm ) of the synovial membrane of 317 patients were obtained by arthroscopic dissection ; in 70 % of all cases non - specific changes were revealed and in 30 % specific changes .    3.7134526965076895
the findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer , uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum UNK and fibrosis of the stroma , vascular proliferation and UNK thickening of the synovial membrane .    3.0952199378359895
the histomorphological findings can only be interpreted reliably and a pathogenetic classification obtained , e . g . , UNK UNK , rheumatoid arthritis or post - traumatic changes , if the arthroscopic findings conclude an exact documentation of the biopsy site and the clinical findings .    3.7365537253057024
the aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of co2 during computer - enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function .    2.519629140411836
methods : transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation .    3.1569106330787644
at distinct time points during the intervention , a cine - loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view .    2.9057284723365937
simultaneously , oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic co2 pressure were taken .    3.720498124763635
wall motion analysis was done postoperatively .    3.522428473625781
results : with increasing duration of single lung ventilation , significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected .    2.710569359506325
this was accompanied by a decrease in pao2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic co2 pressure .    3.1404797883273954
these alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation .    2.955244878366386
conclusion : these results show that computer - enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function .    3.026653857842106
this can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic co2 insufflation .    3.046273879504378
however , in our group , these alteration showed only small clinical relevance .    2.942606517875363
during the last few years the fast development of different laser and laser - like systems for UNK and their one - sided representation in media has led to confusion among UNK and patients .    2.9541353026838877
the object of this review is to give a structured report of different pulsed laser and laser - like systems ( UNK , UNK , long - pulsed UNK - , UNK - and UNK ) that are available in germany , including their side effects and complications . the current status of scientific investigation in this field is discussed .    3.958905806673223
the purpose of the present study was to increase the free range of motion in conventional trust - plate prosthesis design and to optimize the trust - plate contact as well as the UNK area below the trust - plate .    3.090151667905456
although familial occurrence of fibromyalgia syndrome ( fms ) has been commonly observed , data on a genetic role in this condition are limited .    3.2173934641796174
a few studies have reported familial aggregation and association with hla .    3.1864746090800318
we have studied genetic linkage of fms with hla in UNK families , and found a rather weak linkage of fms with hla ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    2.496205262185134
malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period .    3.3219721104179967
approximately 15 - 20 % of all prenatally detected malformations require acute postnatal imaging .    3.4889271919522047
sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of UNK - urologic problems in infancy .    3.8514554807870045
hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology , followed by UNK - dysplastic kidney .    4.354905096219995
discussion : the result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging .    3.2815605713371676
an adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive for accurate diagnosis , for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis of the patients .    3.6129402144700147
calcification is one of the main causes of failure of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves , a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved to date .    3.404501832728838
previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction .    2.9926637943914187
the relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves ( st . UNK medical , UNK ) is assessed by sudan red iii staining to show preexisting lipids .    3.0459767373918547
all porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees .    3.1296246872283486
five valves were subjected to the UNK accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks .    3.478248672739454
distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the sudan red - stained fatty areas .    3.5804010474847776
comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57 - 66 % .    2.891402859013511
two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with UNK and von kossa ' s stain , respectively .    3.084981488503296
by light microscopy , the von kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and UNK microscopic investigation showed UNK substances in areas with lipid deposits .    2.9850569428122458
these preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a UNK role in the calcification of the tissue .    3.5185293985632
substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification .    3.72911361951778
therapy for hip dysplasia and ddh by means of sonography .    3.7419167503123765
the important point seems to be the differentiation between dysplastic hip joints with and without displaced femoral heads .    3.6063254785259002
a historical review of the diagnosis of so - called " congenital dysplasia " and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given .    3.792079515115557
generally , a three - step plan of treatment is recommended : dislocated heads must be reduced , after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable .    3.372067072522162
this is followed by maturation period , until the UNK hyalin UNK performed acetabular roof is ossified .    2.751867156447976
all hip joints , regardless of age , can be assigned to one of these phases .    3.977515950690835
to prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis , the reduction - retention position should be more than 90 ° flexion in the hip joint , but not more than 45 - 50 ° abduction .    3.6415317660869984
in each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint .    3.335846693045703
the appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation .    3.508863074513866
each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three - phase treatment system .    3.8326863900300165
in this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment - phase can be chosen .    3.1041301125548926
a case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported , documenting successful palliative treatment of the UNK papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery .    3.853698464096738
molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the UNK ground state .    3.701325012066032
these processes of activation include very reactive intermediates .    2.9076610546710238
therefore , aerobic cells must cope with - and to some extent also adapt to - oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication , where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate .    2.817277153210126
depending on the strength of these UNK , several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal , steady - state metabolism .    3.192706342132404
most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from UNK reactions ( two - electron transitions ) to increased homolytic reactions ( one - electron transitions ) is observed .    2.634025226552277
homolytic reactions produce free radicals , which are generally UNK by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food , thus UNK metabolic control within certain limits .    3.3381060008495886
at advanced states of stress , control may be gradually lost and UNK radical processes UNK .    3.004789948261568
finally , cellular UNK yield apoptotic , lytic and / or necrotic processes .    3.2240602377023873
every episode during this cascade is UNK by the balance between pro - and antioxidative capacities .    3.354988904501757
antioxidants , which in many cases are free radical UNK or UNK of activated states , comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including UNK , probably as the most prominent ones .    3.8488560991957996
in this article , mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed .    2.7467538607533704
furthermore , examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported .    2.8725040644793842
in a UNK prospective randomized double - blind clinical trial the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was investigated on children with adenoid UNK justifying an operation .    3.2492984876035673
patients were treated with either homeopathic remedies such as UNK UNK d200 , UNK d3 , UNK d200 , barium jodatum UNK and barium jodatum d6 or with placebo .    2.9138191151666843
the duration of the study for each patient was 3 months .    4.153177941427464
examination of the ears using a microscope , UNK , UNK and UNK , as well as UNK and audiometry were performed after 4 , 8 and 12 weeks .    3.900555680597451
out of a total of 97 children studied between the ages of 4 to 10 years 82 could be analyzed .    3.3111652303600976
at the end of the study no operation was required in 70 . 7 % of the placebo - treated children and in 78 . 1 % of the children treated with homeopathic preparations .    4.258124779897592
these results show no statistical significance .    2.97539204318319
a treatment technique favorable for UNK with asymmetric jaws , which combined cranio - caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume , is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk .    2.5337754710418614
three fields adjoining in cranio - caudal direction were completed by 2 fields enclosing the whole target volume .    2.5406180469417317
the matching line was measured and calculated with helax tms© .    3.055411865375215
furthermore a 4 - field UNK and opposing fields were planned .    3.1854271549317836
the dose - volume histograms for target , bladder , intestine and soft tissue were UNK .    3.0622407816586903
normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability , respectively , were calculated for all techniques .    3.4650370674616493
in the region of the matching line the UNK of the measured normalized curves resulted in relative dose maxima of 6 . 0 % ( caudal ) and 4 . 5 % ( cranial ) , respectively .    3.1299503894999354
for fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2 . 0 % ( caudal ) and 1 . 8 % ( cranial ) , respectively .    2.8711019612144715
for the dose profiles calculated with helax tms© no UNK was found .    2.839352689428896
the 5 - field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques , whereas the tumor control remains the same .    3.6788761873150597
in specific cases a technique with cranio - caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk .    2.8058227154283837
disseminated langerhans - cell - histiocytosis ( UNK ) is most frequent in children at the age of 1 - 3 years , seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly .    4.216064759653634
the clinical course may be acute , subacute or chronic , progressive or stationary .    2.975053612681492
spontaneous remissions are possible , but rare .    3.5022443053321353
in elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic .    4.269323448748613
because of its central location , the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function .    3.513796507832196
trauma to osseous and ligamentous structures of the proximal forearm UNK trauma surgeons and orthopedic specialists with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges .    3.6377703499349954
conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion , leading to functional deficits of the entire arm .    3.7841011708819874
there is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis , anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome .    3.203352987112743
with our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical UNK in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed , and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature .    3.9734626975772787
the series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia .    3.6854377558976563
basic principles for treating patients with chronic pain are presented .    3.634193288188651
they are the result of a longterm collaboration of UNK from different medical specialties in the pain outpatient unit of the university of ulm .    3.3370487071773374
in contrast to a variety of literature on chronic pain patients , these principles focus on the contribution of the therapists to the development of problems in treatment .    3.567145604961594
eight principles , considered especially important for the treatment of chronic pain patients are presented and discussed .    3.7439021853862307
we discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature .    3.493572927940016
the therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy .    3.2857286140895554
rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception , because they also show a good response to chemotherapy .    3.84256128329276
14 human UNK were scanned by cat and 3d reconstructed .    3.1020260813396483
in every specimen digital documentation of ccd and UNK ( at ) angle was performed .    3.3880175666830707
with a special software UNK ( orthodoc ) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip UNK was undertaken .    3.364781005786595
the specimens were randomised into two groups , one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component .    3.8366675442977565
after implantation all specimens were evaluated again by cat and cct and at angle were documented again .    2.8897224911834987
the preoperative ccd angle was 126 . 7 ° ( sd = 4 . 0 ) in the manual group and 127 . 8 ° ( sd = 4 . 3 ) in the robodoc group .    2.962749815091297
postoperatively the angle averaged 131 . 9 ° ( sd = 0 . 8 ) in the manual group and UNK . 2 ° ( sd = 1 . 9 ) in the robodoc group .    3.8512857863962093
significant differences were found for the at angle in both groups .    3.0742746781119115
the preoperative at angle in the manual group was 31 . 3 ° ( sd = 8 . 8 ) , decreasing to 20 . 5 ° ( sd = 9 . 5 ) after implantation .    3.301448991347202
in the robodoc group this angle was 30 . 9 ° ( sd = 8 . 0 ) before and 31 . 3 ° ( sd = 8 . 7 ) after implantation .    2.9143352617781813
the difference between pre - and postoperative at angle averaged 10 . 8 ° ( sd = 6 . 4 ) in the manual group and only 0 . 4 ° ( sd = 0 . 9 ) in the robodoc - group .    3.7813195935498785
conclusion : with the technique used , preoperative planning in hip UNK is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain x - ray .    3.2292840329670027
the virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision .    3.2897676350197242
these factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality .    3.531376868977239
1000 drug - related fatalities that were examined in hamburg from 1990 - 1996 by the institute of legal medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone .    3.4520262879038577
the incidence of methadone - related fatalities has increased in the last two years .    3.613341805037714
the highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20 % of all drug - related fatalities .    3.7073576311297547
the mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10 % in the same period .    2.9334833376557694
there is further need for improved methods of registration , documentation and forensic / sociological analysis of all drug - related fatalities for reliable conclusions concerning mortality rates of drug users who are enroled in methadone maintenance programmes .    2.824270590529229
pulmonary infections and tumors are a major cause of death in patients with aids .    4.04698910223941
nevertheless , an accurate diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible during the clinical course of the illness to initiate treatment in time .    3.2319962470550085
computed tomography ( ct ) has proven to provide promising results in the diagnosis of aids - related thoracic diseases .    3.446190301114305
the aim of this paper was to demonstrate the diagnostic capacities of ct in the context of particular aids - related thoracic pathologies .    2.981198510151428
additional information on the spectrum of pathological agents and on differential diagnostic signs is summarized .    3.403829091117532
this study was designed to provide information to which extend home - based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders .    2.9971914762496406
a one day data collection in 29 nursing care services in two north UNK - UNK regions could raise informations about 1 , UNK clients aged 60 years and over 1 , 522 persons ( 41 . 8 % ) had a mental disorder , diagnosed by a nursing and / or medical professional .    3.591485821546026
68 % of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a UNK disorder , 6 % a functional psychoses , and 31 % a neurotic , UNK disorder or substance abuse ( small number of clients with two and more diagnoses ) .    3.899466401694788
82 % of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease ( s ) .    3.317507094146731
these diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home - based nursing care service .    3.2926778366237532
barely 8 % of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services .    3.016950593619114
beside the home - based care , only 12 % of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment .    3.166246530391765
systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of ( UNK - ) psychiatric UNK was a rare exception .    4.140601548340175
acute cerebral nerve paresis can be caused in many different ways .    3.3502687781575102
one of the more rare causes of paresis of one or more neural pathways is dissection of the internal carotid artery .    3.069382742699658
early diagnosis is important , even with atypical symptoms , since prompt UNK therapy can hinder stroke from embolism due to the dissection .    3.676059998400417
we report on two patients with UNK ' s syndrome and UNK - UNK syndrome resulting from dissection of the internal carotid artery .    3.009391543232185
besides the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our study , loss of function has also been reported with the UNK to eighth cranial nerves , so that any painful , sudden cranial nerve deficiency can indicate possible carotid dissection .    3.5315880536811894
in hematopoiesis , regulation and differentiation present a very complex functional network in which multiple factors of the UNK are involved .    3.843505427024607
in addition to direct cell - to - cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix , soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication .    3.062807353340455
cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells .    3.124997204663869
a common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity .    2.7748690085513905
by this mechanism specificity is reduced , on the one hand ; however , on the other the complexity of interactions in the bone marrow is enhanced .    3.9724809693717282
a UNK of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use .    3.0684357693368787
however , there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines .    3.125228135505097
according to the results of our studies elements of the UNK - and megakaryopoiesis are the source of cytokines like il - 1 , il - 3 , il - 6 , and gm - csf .    4.015130370237219
wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest , especially with the detection of the different growth factors .    3.737063915442657
economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing .    3.60988981838378
in germany 25 % of all patients ( ca .    3.589298933326049
1 million ) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers .    3.2778228935910034
the influence of bacterial infection of crural ulcers is controversial .    2.6978130560483624
there is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance .    2.7475155656695582
local antibiotic treatment is difficult , as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing .    4.265307291345921
in vivo and in vitro investigations showed , that chiniofon - containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function .    2.9719652108533015
additionally it was shown , using cultures of fibroblasts , that chiniofon - containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts , whereas UNK - iodine solution , a widely used antiseptic , clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts .    2.9606234021348588
the good clinical results in the treatment of acute and chronic radiation damage indicate that chiniofon - containing antiseptic may have UNK activity .    3.2104247836650157
this article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior .    2.478779538516205
the aim is to describe the development of the desire for children , the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended UNK women and men as well as parents .    3.377187229556851
the main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions .    2.9851391125553093
these heuristics explain patterns and influencing factors of generative action as well as positive and negative influencing factors of the coping process .    3.545253674961363
morbus parkinson is a progressive degenerative disease of the human central , peripheral , and enteric nervous systems .    3.6510785341806122
in the course of the disease , not only the substantia nigra , but also UNK components of the motor system , as well as numerous limbic system and autonomic centers undergo serious damage .    3.3819114046329877
accordingly , parkinson ' s disease is a multisystem disorder .    3.167173278031486
only specific types of projection neurons fall victim to it .    2.937923205181497
the first manifestation of the pathological process which causes the disease are abnormalities of the neuronal cytoskeleton .    3.3511663540075536
intracytoplasmic inclusions evolving in the form of lewy bodies in UNK and lewy UNK in the neuronal processes result in premature cell death of the affected neurons .    3.9320233444752892
on the basis of this selective neuronal vulnerability , a UNK emerges of the pathological changes within the nervous system and corresponding functional impairments .    3.0134150711351055
introduction : children with " nursing bottle syndrome " and long standing teeth UNK and no treatment so far were examined for accompanying pathological changes in the bacterial flora of the mouth and alterations due to chronic inflammation of the oral mucosa and the alveolar UNK .    3.2580553245236867
osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone marrow caused by both non - specific and specific agents .    4.117771115804848
non - specific endogenic osteomyelitis represents the most frequent form , followed by the specific form caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis infection .    3.621310947984504
typically , the non - specific form occurs in children and young adults , and the sites most frequently affected are the distal and the proximal ends of the tibia and femur .    4.482783121618735
in tuberculosis , osteomyelitis is predominantly located in the vertebral bodies .    3.3292795370507124
in rare cases osteomyelitis can be caused by viruses , fungi or echinococcus .    3.088285871347043
it may also occur as so - called acute endogenic osteomyelitis , such as UNK osteomyelitis and UNK ' s abscess .    4.035318233157919
histologically , dense infiltration of leucocytes , granulation tissue and bone UNK can be seen .    3.2953462268343867
in tuberculosis granulomas with central necrosis , epithelioid cells and giant cells of UNK type are characteristically found .    2.872065701504926
most forms of acute osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics , leading to complete healing without complications .    3.6425668173335195
only a few reported cases develop into a secondary , chronic form .    3.0811665990214423
precision of UNK measurements using dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) depends on various known factors , such as positioning , aortic calcification or vertebral fractures .    3.1804552504305086
the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur .    2.8867434523809785
measurements in the lws p . a . , lws lat .    2.8788182931618524
and at ward ' s triangle were made in a total of 100 patients .    3.373008051115596
the subjects were repositioned between measurements .    3.1119598084011186
in order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases , four groups of 25 patients each were formed : three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis , osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group .    3.26324217766134
the mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility .    2.9342082885746468
mean percentual differences of 0 . 18 to 2 . 6 % were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites .    4.598471233583319
after calculation of coefficient of variation , a value between 1 . 2 and 2 . 7 % was found for lws p . a . , between 7 . 1 and 15 . 7 % for lws lat .    4.173870349579544
and between 4 . 1 and 9 . 9 % at ward ' s triangle .    4.050161983405541
it was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas .    3.2735453981423035
conclusion : lateral lumbar spinal measurements using dexa cannot presently be recommended .    2.7280334946921405
measurements and , with limitations , measurements at ward ' s triangle have good precision and could be used for course documentation of bone density .    3.239352040537149
background : we compared the endothelial protective function of two hyaluronic acid UNK ( UNK UNK , UNK ) of different molecular weight and viscosity during UNK in high - risk eyes .    3.7007739037909007
diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50 % of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) .    3.2629926445256663
in early stages of the infection , guillain - barré syndrome or a spontaneously remitting UNK can occur .    2.7437077683778415
the most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with hiv , which can only be treated UNK .    3.0050124395881546
the most important differential diagnosis is a drug - induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside UNK UNK , UNK , or UNK .    3.480642431055133
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids .    3.335840263345266
very rare are steroid - responsive UNK with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative UNK syndrome ( UNK ) .    3.1233058859061518
in the aids stage , UNK can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) or m . tuberculosis - or UNK due to lymphomatous UNK .    3.239990530436928
UNK multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated cmv infection .    3.256537942665018
myopathies can occur in all stages of hiv infection ; their frequency is about 1 % .    3.7567572408314596
primary polymyositis associated with hiv , which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin , must be distinguished from myopathy induced by UNK .    3.1115400662689927
other forms of myopathy are very rare .    3.4955881819434778
54 patients , who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital , were interviewed again in their homes three months later .    3.7987136722891255
contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting , the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses , showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted .    2.9177954154794032
the comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters , the variability was high in the scales , that were used .    3.844209526123429
explanations for these results are discussed .    3.7664902440472408
at a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors .    3.3491140279631546
health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries .    2.90783787420293
this has several causes : changes in demographic structure , the large number of physicians , increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave UNK , UNK increases and - last but not least - medical progress .    3.23474972882238
advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for UNK costs in health care .    3.2832264083106564
careful analyses reveal , however , that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high - technology ( ct , mr ) imaging .    3.872938068350179
the legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained .    3.1533039748023315
relevant suggestions , such as generally accepted examination strategies , should be realized with the help of the scientific societies .    3.686346281919914
background : main features of the UNK - UNK syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes .    3.1940080576412213
further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips , sparse scalp hair , and hypertrichosis .    2.8586720366738314
we report on two premature infants who had completed 25 and 29 weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema .    2.8172184088990564
in both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung .    2.788156935482632
by selective intubation of the respective main bronchus , complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved .    3.1755554666324692
after 3 days ( case 1 ) and after 6 days ) case 2 ) , the unilateral emphysema UNK and , subsequently , bilateral respiration was possible without relapse .    3.813725460440002
6 and respectively 11 days after selective intubation , extubation was performed .    3.1209029187985773
the two children were discharged at the age of 41 / 2 and 21 / 2 months showing complete respiratory compensation and equal ventilation on both sides .    3.1433992147021725
patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris UNK UNK UNK ( UNK - UNK ) presented with multiple cutaneous horns .    4.146193537903564
the clinical picture , the histology , the electro microscopic examination , the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses .    3.136840780108703
the patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures .    3.014867819147072
epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics UNK the air of operating UNK could have deleterious effects on the personnel ' s health .    3.201212433817425
nitrous oxide ( n2o ) UNK vitamin b12 and thus decreases dna production by inactivation of UNK synthase .    2.8451839105465604
therefore , the united states and most european health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks .    2.621167372169382
these values range from 25 to 100 ppm , expressed as time - weighted averages ( UNK ) .    2.9271017482298594
there is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions .    2.680614053462214
the aim of this study was to quantify levels of n2o in a recovery room ( rr ) with an air conditioning system .    2.714452113345265
the blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury .    3.530104110718671
several protocols have been published for optimized management , but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the UNK of trauma and blood loss .    3.8828178297189138
as part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic c - clamp .    3.346860244234806
beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a " UNK equivalent " .    3.246157894785957
18 of the 19 patients had an injury UNK according to group iii and iv of the hannover polytrauma score ( pts ) .    3.4509314606186
concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases ( 23 injuries ) , concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases ( 14 injuries ) .    3.5845809899202363
in 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed .    3.115729958436264
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury , 8 patients survived .    3.4100469471887096
although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors , a 44 % higher subsequent blood substitution ( = 10 UNK ml ) was observed in the UNK group .    3.9029879233183684
in conclusion the data UNK that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the UNK after complex pelvic trauma .    3.2203520151863825
the estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating UNK emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation , pelvic clamps , surgical exploration and tamponade .    3.1760699517906787
this calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols .    3.58885967359438
in contrast to childhood intussusception , the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific .    3.09719981578748
generally organic alterations of the small bowel cause intussusception in adults .    3.537867976599521
in this case report on a retrograde UNK intussusception in a 61 - year - old male , following removal of an intraoperatively placed intestinal tube for ileus therapy , the clinical symptoms , diagnostic methods and therapy for intussusception are described .    3.188924756574148
sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs , but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case .    4.787152346536375
in contrast to childhood intussusception , operative treatment is preferred in adults .    2.606754244369146
the term " frontal lobe syndrome " comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex .    2.83526943406123
however , similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks .    3.135597792103343
with respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions , prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a UNK type , caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections , a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex , and an UNK type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the UNK and the supplementary motor area .    3.6214941762032193
as intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described , in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed .    3.504560049586215
the measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients , their family , and personnel .    3.5151742632698206
a lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine , which in turn makes an impression on public opinion , and UNK the UNK of the co - workers in intensive care medicine .    3.9334155555968526
to form an objective view , we carried out a survey of 40 co - workers ( 11 physicians , 23 from the nursing staff , and 6 ancillary personnel ) regarding the medical technology , the environment in the unit , general medical questions , and the extent of intensive care therapy .    3.4154500807256967
the length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1 - 240 months ( median 18 months ) , the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years ( median 30 years ) .    3.48463618228852
of those questioned 73 % found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful : 100 % of the physicians and only 57 % of the nursing staff were of this opinion .    3.437738697098114
only 9 % of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear - inducing for the patients ; in contrast , 61 % of the nursing staff believed this to be true .    3.748247010631958
the noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65 % of the nursing staff and 45 % of the physicians .    3.6214316755079774
only 22 % of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit ; 48 % felt that they were UNK or even UNK .    3.260802127010054
of the physicians 46 % believed that the patients were comfortable .    3.5625479483953923
of the nursing staff 100 % were of the opinion that for the deceased patients , organ substitution therapy had continued too long .    3.1708880052416144
on the other hand , only 45 % of the residents shared this opinion .    2.975983779631298
the medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful , less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff .    3.6798907959430758
this could possibly be caused by insecurity , lack of information and lack of successful experiences .    3.417216606630073
next to patient outcome , the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team , with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine .    3.6640912882114116
in this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million iu interferon alpha 2a ( UNK a ) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks : 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions ; 1 patient got worse .    3.3666400711333027
pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients , and ige levels showed no change during and after treatment .    3.880234754122525
all patients noted mild , transient , UNK - like symptoms .    3.5887142025728545
the efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate .    3.891096463899395
coagulation abnormalities , ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin ( UNK ) degradation products , are well recognized in patients with bacterial UNK .    3.6273823233268896
therefore , the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps .    3.3497480418894536
we investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of UNK in coagulation at the beginning .    3.5919537439764477
fifteen patients were treated with 1 . 5 - 5 e / kg body weight ( low dose group ) , the others received 8 - 15 e / kg ( high dose group ) .    4.168642198374127
our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d - dimer , tat and ptf 1 + 2 - in the high dose group without any bleeding disorder .    3.1050708474314743
thus , we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with lmwh as shown above .    3.262664901728062
background : laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long - term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate .    3.4612481970370985
methods : all patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short - and long - term results .    3.5174554550902615
results : laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients .    2.882286422819242
in only 3 patients was an adenoma ( stage 0 ) found , and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection .    3.5349576346177445
an oncological resection was performed in 55 patients .    3.9181726453505474
the average age was 62 . 8 + / - 14 . 6 years ( 29 female and 26 male patients ) .    3.3719496862501757
eleven right UNK , 1 left colectomy , 21 sigmoid resections , 16 UNK and 6 UNK resections were carried out .    3.202662290308218
two patients ( 3 . 6 % ) were lost during follow - up .    3.521749616745584
the median follow - up was 27 . 1 months ( range 9 . 1 - 45 . 1 months ) .    4.038979545990728
no port - site metastases were found .    2.8030493747461236
two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence .    3.6184631432414602
the first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma .    2.826270352411142
the second patient developed bilateral lung metastases .    2.8581162894033008
only one patient died during the follow - up period because of myocardial infarction .    3.2593809813064563
conclusion : although the follow - up is short , it seems that the recurrence rate is low .    3.4357166895154587
controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer .    3.5519689992920194
the authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34 - year - old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness ( rüsch endotracheal tube ) .    2.710191456127938
some hours later , she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted .    2.9810718027724223
UNK with a high - volume , low - pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the UNK of the rüsch tube was grossly UNK .    3.6759874429879584
endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm h2o ( the maximum measurement possible with the UNK ) .    3.7915201296172447
the diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy .    3.3650637626942976
the patient immediately underwent a UNK and a 3 - cm tear of the pars UNK of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch .    4.033871669749374
to maintain low airway pressures post - operatively , she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure - controlled ventilation .    3.094264320288877
in this case , it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture .    3.093434766346581
other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed .    3.4489359915918847
urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections , accounting for about 40 % of all nosocomial infections .    3.9203121723052394
in most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters .    3.2039568459384435
the guideline from the centers for disease control and prevention ( UNK , usa ) for the prevention of catheter - associated urinary tract infections , as the most important evidence - based guideline worldwide , was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far .    3.378410917376386
evidence - based national guidelines are not available in germany .    3.6725207879940673
we have , therefore , performed a literature search for randomized , controlled studies on the prevention of catheter - associated urinary tract infections ( medline , UNK UNK , reference text UNK ) published since 1981 .    3.313525786470916
fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified .    3.160474273555402
substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials .    3.431005030232806
based upon the cdc guideline , whose principles are still valid , updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter - associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the national reference center for hospital hygiene .    2.997889792949888
chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as UNK ' s syndome .    3.5707941161875794
acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [ 1 , 8 ] .    3.302809053189389
several complications may occur after total occlusion : urinary bladder necrosis [ 6 ] , left colon ischemia , spinal cord ischemia [ 10 ] , nerve palsy , necrosis of the rectum and gluteal UNK [ 2 , 11 - 13 ] .    3.132195543690645
despite adequate therapy , mortality is over 70 % [ 2 ] .    3.244463044603015
we report the case of a 66 - year - old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an UNK graft .    3.037132415355088
therefore , a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate hla class i and ii typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated .    3.0916807541420974
hitherto UNK cb samples : mean volume 79 + / - UNK , were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery ( n = 302 ) or UNK section ( n = 70 ) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen .    3.7445015862887145
methods for hla - typing by serology for hla - class i and ii from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1 . 5 ml of the whole cb was needed for both the hla - class i and ii typing by serology ( 1 ml ) and dna - typing for hla - class ii ( 0 . 5 ml ) .    3.1729731301804662
only 3 . 5 additional ml of the cb were required for the ab0 typing , control of UNK , determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and UNK and the analysis of UNK maternal cells by simultaneous UNK and UNK analysis of UNK cells and the pcr using sequence - specific priming ( pcr - UNK ) for the non - inherited maternal UNK .    4.298698022542724
mother ' sera have been tested for hbsag , anti - hcv , - UNK , - hiv - 1 - 2 , - ebv , - vca , - UNK - ii , - cmv , toxoplasmosis and syphilis .    4.193868988307636
nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~ 0 , 6 % .    3.622159464891299
they are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma .    3.2968538110904873
amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor UNK only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin ( one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [ UNK ] , one a leiomyosarcoma , one a malignant mesothelioma , and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [ pnet ] .    2.9914571755214503
the differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum , undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and , especially in the case of pnet , malignant lymphoma .    3.700149221638895
preoperative chemotherapy and down - staging can improve the operability and prognosis , especially in pnet .    3.7838680929201054
in patients with renal or hepatic failure , the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways , leading to the necessity to correct the dose .    3.2401002223775697
the liver is the major site for UNK of most opioids .    3.672373461286849
the major metabolic pathway is oxidation .    2.9871682432191373
exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine , which undergo primarily UNK , and remifentanil which is cleared by UNK hydrolysis .    3.606439398910094
the hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly UNK by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency .    4.031034024906872
some metabolites such as morphine - 6 - glucuronide ( UNK ) or UNK are active opioid agonists .    3.66817803151299
with high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression .    3.1322144992162166
in addition , special risks are known for UNK that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures .    3.6484682053716253
few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of UNK , UNK and UNK have been reported .    4.31876844539894
the elimination half - life of these drugs was prolonged .    3.4236474983640908
lastly , the disposition of methadone , buprenorphine , fentanyl , UNK and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure .    3.606954557992626
UNK : aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults ' 13c - urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with helicobacter pylori .    2.8843745867430792
methods : in 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an elisa test specific for helicobacter pylori .    3.5684518134924454
in 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa .    3.253544567341175
cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal .    3.2064408222039606
results : with the serological or histological result as reference method , the cut - off value for children ( delta value = 5 permil ) has shown a sensitivity / specificity of 70 % / 95 % or 100 % / 100 % respectively .    2.924585581063149
cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly .    3.11072590189495
30 minutes after 13c - urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection .    3.310936247632092
conclusion : our modification of the 13c - urea breath test for children is suitable to prove an helicobacter pylori infection .    2.5035608230527417
this review summarizes some aspects of german pediatrics as it developed after world war ii .    2.865602867142466
having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late UNK and UNK and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly UNK nation .    3.270955403625863
as in other countries , the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social UNK and expectations , and by economic restrictions .    3.3432891413597763
national specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and UNK preventive care program under a public health plan .    3.168468149299818
the need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among UNK .    3.504771204424503
aim of this study was to isolate t lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to chlamydia antigens .    2.89810156508627
in recent years , mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease .    3.0920831634909733
however , since october 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed .    3.6048000779988367
at four hospitals in the saarland , germany , 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period .    3.316834336379439
in addition to the case history and clinical findings , the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased igm titer .    3.5584634481800137
none of the patients had been previously vaccinated .    3.453090225228649
the main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination , one which has almost no side effects .    3.2805197876088106
the goal of this study is to describe the disease , present our own results , and indicate the need for vaccination .    3.6045024208808503
in addition to providing information , a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination .    3.3021334329694616
although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years , the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination .    3.8682850247878218
neurofibromas , UNK au UNK macules and UNK in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von recklinghausen ' s neurofibromatosis ( nf - 1 ) .    3.311004722326541
less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi .    3.105985893808583
we describe the case of a 21 - year - old UNK woman who showed generalized , multiple neurofibromas , a solitary plexiform UNK in the left gluteal region and UNK nodules .    3.2406011743368346
in the right zygomatic region she presented a grey - blue , hair - bearing macule , which we saw as a variant of ota ' s naevus .    2.9643679048867146
a genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local UNK can be supposed , as both schwann ' s cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest .    3.176152542598013
such pathologic rearrangement in the UNK of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of nf - 1 and dermal melanocytic nevi .    4.287207151934716
infectious agents may directly or indirectly ( through the response of the host ' s immune system ) modulate the growth of vascular cells .    3.1023986045069876
local and / or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of ( re - ) stenosis in the vascular tree .    3.8100471890399237
further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for UNK and restenosis .    3.9591518189386217
their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions .    3.2814397475884194
besides other reasons , cost UNK UNK the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient .    3.562365308598793
since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age , elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk .    3.1601103198145726
routine ecg , however , is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age .    3.46251539322509
the validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results .    3.4512065000650063
by preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients ; thus , in patients of asa - risk groups i - ii younger than 74 years of age routine chest - x - ray cannot be justified .    3.90868140334715
in patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ecg is ambiguous , dipyridamole - thallium - myocardial scintigraphy ( dtms ) and dobutamine - stress - echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events .    2.7192299558618545
in that respect , dobutamine - stress - echocardiography appears to be superior to dtms .    2.958388947753522
the laboratory tests required in patients of different asa - risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview .    3.2165793995602434
generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit .    2.9526821653270896
both neuropathic ( critical illness polyneuropathy ) and myopathic ( critical illness myopathy ) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness .    2.8763716800768613
this article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes .    3.2482800407515873
an efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of UNK changes .    3.4339837735786833
psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible .    3.906743066712686
modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color doppler sonography allow the UNK to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy .    3.184566478581635
the use of high - resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation .    2.6246036865971263
this development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands .    2.904961458576359
unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish .    3.610405945455538
modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre - findings by other clinics .    2.9690623617358938
great importance , however , must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and UNK .    3.665334892976875
we report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the charité .    2.7414531488849656
infrainguinal arterial reconstruction for intermittent claudication has been discouraged because of fear of bypass graft failure , significant perioperative complications , and limb loss .    3.1421556019581773
this may be worse than the natural history of the disease .    2.6993271269446386
in our study , we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years .    3.095840478129684
in 1994 the UNK device ' UNK gamma knife ' ( lgk ) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments .    2.930836327420586
high quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery .    3.640849554962708
the target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0 . 5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0 . 035 cm3 .    3.3854173732076585
quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments .    4.0660554667240305
these values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple UNK .    3.6338623191126387
an analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery .    4.430311867738807
a highly significant correlation between a risk prediction model for the stereotactic linear accelerator on the one hand and a different model for the lgk on the other could be shown .    3.5965976610277632
this result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results .    3.5382142090686575
even if UNK UNK UNK has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections , to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of UNK fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures , especially the hand disinfection .    3.4475509999742977
he has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or UNK lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health - care personnel act as UNK .    2.7199829136187748
as a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection , he noticed that generally only the UNK organism of the patient is involved as an infection target .    3.6337322766572764
the impact of his doctrine not only made him " UNK of the mothers " but also justifies to regard him as " father of the obstetric infection prevention " if not even as the founder of the modern science - based hospital hygiene .    3.2622708329535506
in this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard x - ray images .    3.288905595546436
our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their UNK in the x - ray image .    4.773092296219977
when we know the exact shape of these two components , we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay .    3.3055171000971026
first results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task .    3.442048920258773
most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with borrelia burgdorferi .    2.7811230177496022
after hematological spreading of the vector multiple UNK UNK occur with a very low incidence in europe as described in the case of a 2 1 / 2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine .    3.4831803044309444
one year follow - up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis .    3.6789996158467204
this means an excellent prognosis for those children with borreliosis who are treated promptly .    3.431671513777809
background : we compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so - called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 db steps .    2.9123345066258004
the aim of the study was to establish whether the threshhold splitting strategy had advantages over the suprathreshhold strategy that has been used to date .    2.7785564995818874
resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three - step regression grading system : grade i , no or only slight tumor regression ; grade ii , incomplete tumor regression ; grade iii , complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue .    3.0381819930580964
in five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples , a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis , foam cell rim , vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen .    3.0250081659122348
this morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic , but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy .    3.1177606644648197
the presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci , however , argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression , which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer .    3.457187279924905
background : the term " UNK ' s diseas " ( UNK lymph node hyperplasia ) comprises a heterogeneous UNK entity among lymphoproliferative disorders .    3.1139031735346516
in accordance with the german law on care for UNK persons , an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care .    3.176942527581918
construction of the scale , UNK descriptions , definitions , algorithms for sum score and inter - rater reliability data are reported .    2.9219727502169768
the scale can reliably measure the need of care , quality of care , and who is the care provider .    3.954067694585366
5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) improves the success of UNK .    3.032225808394921
since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5 - fu , 5 - fu is applied intraoperatively .    3.6173589856837802
postoperatively on day 4 the iop was significant lower ( 4 . 8 mmhg ) in the 5 - fu - group in comparison to the untreated group ( p = 0 . 005 ; power 0 . 80 ) .    3.7011867484974688
after 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmhg and was not significant any more ( p = 0 . 16 ) .    3.332338570103738
after 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmhg was found with a p - value of 0 . 16 .    3.505569400191292
it may be that these results are not just due to an antiproliferative mechanism ; a direct toxic effect of 5 - fu should be considered .    3.5516770611397277
5 - fu side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5 - fu group .    3.4083836814893487
however , one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5 - fu group .    3.654773025720077
this study found intraoperative use of 5 - fu to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower iop in the direct postoperative phase .    3.6009772172705614
however , this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone , but might be of toxic origin .    3.6151808983854106
a postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery .    2.9695057871893282
clinical signs , laboratory findings , ultrasound and UNK lead to diagnosis .    3.334354812513663
we report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube .    2.9521713745044336
in all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube .    3.1733099739190287
two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess , and in 2 patients drainage of a UNK was performed .    4.311329879357665
in 2 cases with biliary peritonitis , a step - by - step lavage was necessary .    2.8919903606857873
the nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract .    3.1055543753168564
description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes , which requires dialysis , and tertiary hyperparathyroidism , who developed fulminant systemic UNK after successful renal transplantation .    3.471913531923848
characteristic of this syndrome , there occured soft tissue calcification , UNK of the small and medium - sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis .    3.763541022822651
the pathogenesis is not completely clear , but challenging agents like corticosteroids or UNK , in a sensitized organism ( at hypercalcemia or elevated UNK ) could lead to calcium deposits .    3.6225857885867336
lungs , stomach , kidneys , cutis , heart and vascular system are most frequently involved .    3.5251206346186614
treatment is primarily supportive ; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis .    3.236006130922265
contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex - containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines .    3.1511809904586974
recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy .    4.279940042246599
the cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented , and the importance of the association of latex and cross - reactivity with food items is stressed .    3.7014605431828085
the food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado ; banana , avocado and buckwheat ; and banana , avocado and tomato .    2.5408789581035194
the cross - reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before .    2.820433616964825
the hearing impairment may be a UNK , a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss .    4.232412820912208
the renal disease is UNK , a bilateral , congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of UNK .    3.8195696513123294
the bor syndrome is an autosomal - dominant disease .    3.3438673016363643
corneal metabolism is reduced after cataract extraction .    3.341243115945694
the available literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts .    1.9603217047714834
the co2 laser myringotomy is a current low - pain procedure for middle - ear ventilation for secretory otitis media ( som ) that can be performed under topical anesthesia , even in children .    3.233761060835224
the duration of middle - ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created .    3.4385613735794043
perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks , thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes .    3.1088895984102427
to date , the co2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope .    3.0058544128391667
the co2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system .    3.3502553737095404
the incorporation of a small UNK - sive co2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in som therapy .    3.0323615823815717
abstract amifostine is an organic UNK which UNK normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of UNK induced neutropenia , reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described .    3.318123391606148
however , no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin - based chemotherapy .    2.903043704977741
aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal , hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity .    3.2963258490498815
17 patients ( mean age : 62 . 6 [ 45 - 74 ] ) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy ( 1 - 6 cycles ) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg / m2 .    3.431202841717596
amifostine ( UNK - UNK mg / m2 ) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy .    3.689918478755787
for all patients creatinine clearance , serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium , and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle .    3.0256518283210605
a group of 12 patients ( mean age : 61 . 9 [ 51 - 67 ] ) did undergo mvec chemotherapy ( 1 - 4 cycles ) without receiving amifostine and served as control group .    3.2438457381972245
amifostine was well tolerated and only 1 patient suffered from gastrointestinal discomfort , blood pressure remained unchanged in all patients .    3.537256116327344
amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency : mean creatinine clearance was 125 + / - 20 ml / min prior to and 115 + / - 25 ml / min after chemotherapy .    3.897577320969297
in the control group , however , creatinine clearance dropped from 121 + / - 30 ml / min to 85 + / - 20 ml / min after completion of mvec chemotherapy .    3.7563416318476226
serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly ( 1 . 1 mg / dl prior to and 1 . 2 mg / dl after chemotherapy ) , magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy .    4.050828877411609
significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group .    3.8792579089041297
amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy .    3.535944760888811
based on our data amifostine should be applied in the supportive management to prevent chemotherapy induced complications .    3.0088839248835706
the diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia ( cll ) by conventional cytology is UNK because UNK criteria of malignancy are often lacking .    2.8735178107273587
UNK of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) samples .    3.3412919662866827
molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of cll .    3.2634463875113706
we present an 54 old patient who was diagnosed with cll five years ago .    3.1983145718803443
despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) nor conventional csf analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis .    2.8155787163794197
using pcr we selectively amplified the highly variable and UNK - specific cdr3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( UNK ) in dna obtained from both csf and peripheral blood cells .    3.46706868088087
in the orthopedic department of the university hospital homburg / saar , we use since 1993 a computer - based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations .    3.1141933050909167
hardware consists of UNK / windows pc ' s in a UNK - network .    4.5210139142868915
our software is a combination of UNK - system for managing patient - data and a special coding program for icd and UNK - digits .    4.177607683082729
our experience shows that computer assisted clinic - management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation .    3.3544019564047987
until now , we used the system for 31 500 patients and UNK operations .    3.5424738784350662
a flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration .    3.2207312525655407
moreover , in the university hospital homburg / saar , the different departments are linked by an UNK with connection to other scientific networks and the internet .    2.9714212705700676
in one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology , a UNK can be diagnosed .    3.704913986212124
etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene , foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections .    3.182037020093944
the microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci , streptococci , e . coli , and in case of chronical - recurrent discharge also b . UNK and UNK .    3.8804244134585244
the symptoms are itching , burning , UNK , discharge and rubor of the vulva .    3.555407519911297
a systemic application of antibiotics is not necessary , a local treatment with antibiotic solutions is contraindicated and the usual vaginal suppositories are unsuitable for girls .    3.1719662219190625
excellently , a single - dose application being sufficient ; burning , itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence , so that the healing process is accelerated .    3.3901271941262934
the author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery .    2.705432174860079
the differences of the UNK of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed .    4.275619048946598
two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego - structure .    3.1760031804570437
then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour , especially those of the group of UNK , and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed .    4.271323030675893
the theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding UNK processes .    3.1692461917208807
general and special technical UNK for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived .    3.835758525237111
especially the relationship to the theories of bion , UNK and winnicott is estimated .    3.759679787954321
the situation of psychiatric patients in the ukraine is determined by the financial and economic difficulties of this country .    3.5339917489739983
in the larger cities , so - called UNK take care of ambulant psychiatric patients .    2.992355201906174
however , no other social psychiatric institutions exist .    2.847998249220587
here , the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in UNK and UNK as examples .    3.6457889837223094
undertreatment is also a problem , because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the ukraine .    4.00770761095556
UNK of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems .    2.93143286178366
improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in ukraine .    3.118050118266345
renal lesions are frequently encountered in blunt pediatric abdominal trauma .    3.0959295304808965
in this retrospective study , we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive .    3.3537552725291304
from 1976 to 1996 , 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department .    3.096000233743389
patients were evaluated using abdominal UNK , ultrasonography , and urinary analysis .    3.262055017582209
in specific cases , iv urography , ct scan , and / or angiography were applied .    3.355314206057249
we used the organ injury scale ( UNK ) for classification of renal trauma into five grades .    3.5858935079392977
the result of a b - scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used b - system , the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator .    3.3935870292356793
the estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters , independent of the type of the used b - system , is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of b - scan images .    3.356965697299067
results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented .    3.102152648776996
UNK persons were interviewed three times ( quantitative study ) and 20 persons conducted a semi - structured diary ( qualitative study ) , covering in both groups a two - year period ( from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement ) .    3.1457072343208794
they were asked about their subjective well - being ( UNK , UNK , satisfaction , stresses ) , their life situation and their personal , social and material resources .    3.1940288839187203
the results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains ( leisure time ) and losses ( financial , social status ) , but overall maintains a high level of well - being .    2.88329662297358
specific analyses point out inter - individual differences , risk factors and resources , like a high level of trait well - being , health , social networks and an UNK outlook .    3.4255164095069452
the diary analyses lead to UNK , more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects .    3.593281301890352
consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed .    3.407611970261886
intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence : group i - problems associated with access ; group ii : introduction of the endovascular stent ( a : release of the main segment , b : anchoring the second limb ) ; and group iii : incidence of primary UNK .    3.7241573279518843
interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic , hematological and oncological diseases for years .    3.3129850777879684
recently , interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis .    2.9158650255621903
a 41 - year - old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non - tender , UNK - sized , cutaneous - subcutaneous , reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections .    2.9395280612655705
interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks .    3.054496433367163
with topical corticosteroids , the skin lesions resolved .    3.898747499302599
when subcutaneous injections were resumed at a reduced dose , only erythema around injection sites developed without induration or pain .    2.9194326126991617
slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described .    3.318914597045504
however , no reports of large , painful , cutaneous - subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published .    2.666659957223832
in adults , infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease , caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance .    3.4016252323078633
in conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space , local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates .    3.4728610725120976
these changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease .    3.823408670083824
however , in UNK and mrt pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days .    3.0718593542133927
thus , early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible .    3.518417101774744
in early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body ( subchondral , UNK , ventral , central ) .    3.3436359164862046
apparently , a soft tissue tumor is associated .    3.948019454084774
sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes .    4.032820095479667
after at least 12 weeks , computed tomography can reveal typical UNK of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony UNK .    4.1913812866332085
in addition , mrt as well as ct can be helpful in the detection and localization of complications as abscesses or affection of the vertebral canal .    3.7680020707346538
the tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis .    2.710527423562582
clinical findings , affection of several vertebral bodies , large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis , but these findings are not specific of the disease .    3.385040547287364
degenerative disorders such as erosive osteochondrosis or changings due to chronic dialysis ( e . g . amyloid or crystal UNK ) may cause even more problems in differential diagnosis .    3.0483194884211846
typical for a UNK process is the integrity of the UNK disc space , which is a rare finding in spondylitis .    5.00810391282094
to show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot .    3.63699425037856
we examinated 10 cadaver UNK of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20 - mhz - probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region .    3.593192729880744
especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic ( saving of expenses , lack of radiation , side - to - side comparison ) .    3.452457665313425
an essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment ( UNK ) .    3.0146016694844624
UNK studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration .    3.4334628511758556
as the available UNK for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the UNK , it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow UNK of hair colour .    3.8677206668148054
the natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart ( UNK , darmstadt , germany ) .    3.2375641569699614
subsequently the colours of the hair and the samples of the hair colour chart used for comparison were measured by colorimetric analysis and the UNK * a * b * values were determined .    3.3558322063973347
the descriptive UNK of the hair colours ( e . g .    3.9253313129773257
UNK , brown , black ) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results .    2.941879263251285
when the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible .    3.9133269268616035
we measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing ( wobadd ) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [ ips 5 , 10 , 15 mbar above positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) ] and in a new ventilatory mode , automatic tube compensation ( atc ) , in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency ( ari ) .    2.880886818716814
in atc , endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed - loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure .    3.70073232793564
pressure support in this mode , i . e . airway pressure above peep , is equal to the actual flow - dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube ( ett ) .    3.4200283944056347
airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end .    3.5603598911309406
as the tube resistance of ett seriously UNK expiration and can cause desynchronization between ventilator and patient , airway pressure is reduced below peep during expiration in the same way as it is increased during inspiration .    2.964387961070977
the result is a near - constant tracheal pressure at peep both during inspiration and during expiration .    2.7286316491202993
this mode could be best termed as " electronic extubation " .    2.8595084724627746
the most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ari patients was their minute ventilation ( 17 . 8 + / - 1 . 85 l / min in ari patients vs 7 . 3 + / - 3 . 1 l / min in the postoperative patients ) .    3.7406539165722075
in the postoperative patients augmentation of ips from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume ( vt ) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate ( rr ) compared with atc ( vtatc , postop = UNK + / - 78 ml ; rratc , postop = 16 + / - 4 min - 1 ; vtips5 , postop = UNK + / - 79 ml ; UNK , postop = 15 + / - 4 min - 1 ; vtips10 , postop = UNK + / - 86 ml ; UNK , postop = 14 + / - 4 min - 1 ; vtips15 , postop = 660 + / - 151 ml ; UNK , postop = 12 + / - 4 min - 1 ) , whereas the augmentation of ips of 5 and 10 mbar in the ari patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in vt , after switching from atc to ips ( vtatc , ari UNK + / - 308 ml , rratc , ari = 24 + / - 6 min - 1 ; vtips5 , ari = UNK + / - 315 ml ; UNK 5 , ari = 27 + / - 8 min - 1 ; vtips10 , ari = 653 + / - UNK ml ; UNK , ari = 25 + / - 8 min - 1 : even ips 15 was not able to reestablish vt at the values observed during atc ( vtips15 , ari = 680 + / - UNK ml ) .    3.164115220753992
during atc wobadd was small in both postoperative and ari patients ( wobadd , atc , postop = 93 + / - 36 mj / l , wobadd , atc , ari = 116 + / - 72 mj / l ) .    3.392195990174555
in the postoperative patients , an inspiratory pressure support of 5 mbar was not sufficient to compensate wobadd compared with atc .    3.0347462290504024
however , ips 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for wobadd ( wobadd . UNK , postop wobadd , UNK , postop = 189 + / - 77 mj / l ; wobadd , UNK , postop = 55 + / - 30 mj / l ; wobadd , UNK , postop = 21 + / - 11 mj / l ) .    3.3877097606050373
in the ari patients an ips 5 , 10 or 15 mbar was not sufficient to compensate for wobadd ( wobadd , ips 5 , ari = UNK + / - 262 mj / l ; wobadd , ips 10 , ari 863 + / - UNK mj / l ; wobadd , ips 15 , ari UNK + / - 298 mj / l ) .    2.7232464636405918
under atc , wobadd was only 15 % of wobadd under ips of 15 mbar .    3.1606348266876956
these two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an fio2 > 0 . 5 .    3.8804245105756565
our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ari patients may be caused by the ett rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung .    3.519943123491609
atc is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ett and real ventilatory dependence .    3.5019978709185584
the preoperative localization of UNK - resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance .    3.6351207488828425
in addition to conventional mri diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions , proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( hmr spectroscopy ) can be useful for assessing the UNK of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies .    3.267006383177993
the technique and findings of hmr spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies .    3.267930879788968
the findings indicate that chemical shift imaging ( UNK ) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery .    3.493905007568845
this paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients .    2.556764562819911
the utilisation of UNK UNK ( kbt ) and creative therapy in our conflict - and solution - oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious UNK between UNK and UNK and a " potential space " ( winnicott ) can be opened to the creative work with the patients .    3.5492252673003186
this paper illustrates with some UNK examples the utilisation of kbt in transforming the traumatic body - UNK into UNK memory - scripts , by the use of UNK processes .    3.107630156942332
in 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker ( UNK , intermedics ) and different pacing leads , the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated .    3.838755489161671
2 . 8 + / - 0 . 9 years after implantation , atrial and ventricular pulse - width thresholds ( trs ) ( ms ) were determined at 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , and 2 . 0 v , and the charge delivered at threshold was UNK .    4.182914185566341
if trs was < 1 . 50 ms at 0 . 5 v , an amplitude of 1 . 0 v was programmed in the atrium and the UNK ; if trs was < 1 . 50 ms at 1 . 0 v , then an amplitude of 2 . 0 v was chosen .    3.0993767031887645
two times the charge threshold ( 2x qrs ) , two times the voltage threshold ( 2x urs ) , and three times the pulse - width threshold ( 3x trs ) were programmed as the safety margins for pacing .    3.2660856742023836
with every safety margin , battery current ( irs ) ( µa ) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in UNK mode with 70 bpm .    2.9319061912472595
UNK was significantly lower with 2x qrs as compared with 2x urs ( 13 . 43 + / - 1 . 0 vs . 14 . 20 + / - 1 . 2 µa , p < 0 . 01 ) and as compared with 3x trs ( 13 . 99 + / - 1 . 2 µa , p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.7615939827044427
pacemaker longevity derived from these current data was significantly longer with 2x qrs ( 112 + / - 8 months ) as compared with 2x urs ( 106 + / - 9 , p < 0 . 01 ) and as compared with 3x trs ( 108 + / - 8 , p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.989059397934745
if current consumption is compared intraindividually in UNK on the programmed amplitude , battery current is significantly lower at 1 . 0 v as compared with 2 . 0 v resulting in a mean reduction of 0 . 63 µa ( - 4 . 9 % , p < 0 . 05 ) and an average gain in longevity of 5 months .    3.8410540950476473
this applies to every safety margin tested .    2.893268307216361
differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption .    3.0703501921235885
any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient , giving informed consent .    3.766616104199652
this prerequisite is based on the right to self determination .    4.257641152757516
otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury .    3.684469741526642
the attending physician ' s duty is to find out this will , which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved .    3.4215161771247766
before the procedure the physician has to have a UNK talk with the patient .    3.8594065837685836
he has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient ' s life .    3.080203578344072
the physician has to find out , weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement .    3.4076589628738447
furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient ' s fear and to increase his confidence .    3.3634270892835967
the main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation .    3.072340932239379
one has to differentiate between the physiological mental UNK and dementia or psychiatric diseases .    3.414138019861069
in these cases a third party consent is necessary .    2.915832748078473
this review of german neurology during the nazi era UNK first the significance of jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty , and the UNK loss that their UNK from germany represented .    3.4658681831624993
a brief discussion of the scientific UNK of german neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles , exemplified by the human experiments of g . UNK .    3.435457041661199
the spirit of the age UNK a UNK influence .    3.7068433908274696
a UNK survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal - and electronic working industry of northrhine westfalia was carried out by UNK UNK und institute of UNK to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement .    3.1538944984322623
as the results show , firms in northrhine westfalia are UNK to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve .    3.2340376314180723
firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement .    3.5450745508809507
therefore partial retirement is created as a so - called " blocked model " .    3.1355103532148085
from february 1991 to may 1998 , UNK patients had a cardioverter / defibrillator ( icd ) implanted .    3.7856491332226
mean age was 64 + / - 9 years , 278 male and 62 female .    3.4163783740748896
60 % of patients had coronary artery disease and 31 % dilative cardiomyopathy .    4.317817887738708
ejection fraction was 38 + / - 14 % .    3.3636954845334825
the indication for an implantable cardioverter / defibrillator was in 57 % of patients ventricular tachycardia , in 43 % ventricular fibrillation .    3.5012257400154954
298 patients had a single - chamber cardioverter / defibrillator implanted , 42 patients a dual - chamber cardioverter / defibrillator .    3.4585289393132412
in 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted .    3.1467262285813336
implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in UNK pectoral .    3.740403092053759
over a period of 7 years 34 lead - related complications occured in 33 patients ( 9 . 7 % ) , after a median of 2 months after implantation .    3.737798007561778
diagnosis was made by routine chest x - ray in about 55 % of lead - related complications , by clinical presentation ( inadequate therapy , pain ) in 24 % , and by electrical parameters in 21 % .    3.509983858251236
in patients with an abdominal implantation site , lead - related complications occurred in 20 % , in contrast to 6 % in patients with a pectoral implantation site .    4.070567001568671
the recommendations for introducing emergency medical UNK ( emt ) defibrillation in germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor - UNK - UNK or the experiences of the german multi - center - study .    3.7809795616245396
this analysis intends to contribute data to an emt defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous - system .    2.8570442369367575
methods : in a prospective study a emt - defibrillation group ( = dg ) was compared with a standard group ( basic life support by emts and defibrillation by emergency physicians ) ( = sg ) and a control group ( emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with emts ) ( = cg ) .    3.1783762203271113
in the dg semiautomatic defibrillators from UNK ( UNK 3000 ) were used .    3.465658447806353
successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) , the pittsburgh brain stem score ( UNK ) , and pittsburgh cerebral ( UNK ) and overall performance UNK ( UNK ) .    4.014127157069545
results : over 13 months 43 patients were included , primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) .    2.833822918942025
dg and sg did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long - term prognosis ( primary successful 8 . 3 % vs . 38 . 9 % , definite successful 0 % vs . 27 . 8 % ) .    3.6987851921741908
in the long term survival rate there were no significant differences .    3.10321420131334
in the dg significantly less patients received bystander cpr ( 8 . 3 % ) than in the other groups ( 55 . 6 % and 69 . 2 % ) .    3.233645428865011
neither the variable " witnessed UNK " nor " bystander cpr " had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study .    3.1454260504655407
the average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5 . 5 + / - 2 . 4 min , without a significant difference between the groups .    3.8500827111403684
conclusions : a comparison of this study with american , european and german recommendations for emt defibrillation programms revealed some deviations .    3.2990693635732233
bystander cpr seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician .    3.731293158170428
a benefit of emt defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our " rendezvous - system " , possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min ( 3 . 5 min ) .    3.910072745716284
since the result is in accordance with the german multi - center - study , a critical consideration of a emt defibrillation program seems to be necessary in " rendezvous - systems " .    3.382339709395682
ninety - two strains of UNK - resistant enterococci ( UNK ) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed .    3.7543411932638575
they were primarily isolated in intensive care units ( general , surgical , UNK , pediatric , oncological ones ) , but also in UNK / dialysis or neurologic / orthopaedic wards .    3.665733910420253
a dominance of vana type e . faecium strains was observed ( n = 81 ; 88 . 0 % ) .    3.3434974473596335
in addition , strains of e . UNK ( vana ; n = 4 ; 4 . 4 % ) , e . faecium ( UNK ; n = 1 ; 1 . 1 % ) , and e . UNK ( UNK , n = 6 ; 6 . 5 % ) were found .    4.64933351891441
the 81 vana strains of e . faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics : UNK , ciprofloxacin ( both 93 . 8 % ) , ampicillin , UNK ( both 88 . 9 % ) , rifampicin ( 79 . 0 % ) , trimethoprim / UNK ( 61 . 7 % ) , UNK ( 18 . 9 % ) , UNK acid ( 12 . 3 % ) , UNK / UNK ( 7 . 4 % ) ; UNK ( 46 . 9 % ) and UNK ( 37 . 0 % ) , also together with ampicillin resistance ( 9 . 9 - 35 . 8 % ) .    4.377112945991501
in some of these vana type strains resistance to UNK cannot be completely expressed in - vitro .    3.123488813923617
UNK analysis of e . faecium outbreak isolates ( vana type ) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra - and interhospital spread of a defined strain .    3.019523879243273
however , heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical .    2.839229754144641
the UNK dissociation ( sd ) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle , mostly associated with polytraumatized critically ill patients .    3.43398010944684
the 3 patients are presented from trauma to management , with remarks to various possibilities in treatment .    3.272557382814209
reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients , making it different to look for UNK or defining standards , whereas current guidelines are being mentioned , including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and UNK endangered patients .    3.1201857325083755
this is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56 - year - old male .    2.9687080763170646
recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis , as the patient could not remember any trauma .    4.5623769997739325
after performing mri , a 12 x 5 mm signal - free zone showed up in the area of the lateral UNK femoris , which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed .    3.50428135327608
the patient was discharged soon after without any complaints .    2.814303309074775
many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age - dependent interval .    2.8362747330310216
they inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular UNK and particularly by the physiological ability to UNK visually disturbing stimuli .    3.298890811192926
red cells , platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes , causing a lot of side effects .    3.2106965976767134
modern filtration - and apheresis - techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of < UNK per unit .    3.4679037961463783
the best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised UNK - filtration .    3.015974138429907
this is an effective method , to prevent cytokine - mediated and leucocyte - mediated febrile UNK transfusion reactions ( UNK ) , to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte - and UNK - antigens , to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion , e . g .    3.492171628792546
cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) and to exclude in special cases bacterial UNK .    3.504414831654755
in addition , there are references to reduce the postoperative infections , the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery .    4.2311678741175465
the use of leucocyte - UNK blood components for special indications is meanwhile established .    3.1421448735814743
some european countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes .    3.2476889512709994
the authors recommend the general leucocyte - depletion of blood components considering the german medical law ( UNK ) and cost / benefit ratio .    3.3557942682477018
evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients ' defensiveness .    2.9139736361673423
this study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client - centered therapy and followed - up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness , measured with validity scales of personality inventories mmpi - k , fpi - r and UNK - test , influences ratings ( scales cgi , UNK , hamd , UNK ) before and after therapy .    3.158154217992481
patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow - up .    2.3332047944837666
the extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in UNK in these patients , indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales .    3.9428736640210853
inpatient client - centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self - criticism and diminished it in the case of initial UNK .    3.4198518406974405
introduction : because of their frequency and consequences UNK remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact .    3.132216030226745
there is a high demand on therapeutic modalities , using UNK medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic diseases .    3.577834585563307
no data is available on the UNK of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture .    3.9622594890377894
materials and results : 278 patients with chronic pain for at least 3 months were observed .    3.547062469197718
all three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores .    2.950741531504051
best results were gained with steroid injection ( n = 26 ; 66 % pain reduction ) , acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62 % ( n = 230 ) , whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48 % ( n = 22 ) .    3.502166762417385
sole UNK - hcl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities .    3.7720296445944426
conclusion : according to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative therapy in cases of sciatic pain .    3.301217571905578
taking into account that patients increasingly prefer UNK modalities of treatment our study gains importance for UNK UNK .    3.0286545776114284
this paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities .    3.2974318090153343
to find answers , a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all german psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire .    3.307497293398152
the results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals .    2.94833592334014
about half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies , mostly including prospective , randomized clinical trials .    3.3162219558284556
these studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders : substance abuse , schizophrenic and affective disorders , anxiety , and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders .    2.8658449314614476
to improve psychotherapy research conditions further , efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange , financial support , and the integration of institutions outside the universities .    3.6119327424992487
there is little to suggest that the course of UNK can be substantially affected by drug treatment .    4.05464753348902
the vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria , fetal heart rate abnormalities , UNK UNK and the incidence of preterm birth .    3.674441412807592
there is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia , hellp syndrome , renal failure or eclampsia .    3.618322140091657
moreover , blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth .    3.141762153040391
antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170 / 110 mm hg ) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage .    3.532970332877652
UNK injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress .    3.62013122928095
oral UNK offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and UNK vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress .    3.4256455488100896
cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium , which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow .    2.9497650541977163
controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia .    3.446438451707017
furthermore , magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia .    3.1080747948802347
also the neonatal outcome UNK magnesium , which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia .    3.5389202240766755
baker ' s cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the department of traumatology of the university of cologne from 1988 to 1997 .    3.8646156672876
the subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography ( follow - up : 95 % ) .    3.7744627046793893
all patients were examinated before surgery , sonography and x - ray of the knee were performed .    3.3265137675672474
we differentiated between the congenital primary cyst ( 39 % ) , and the secondary form , which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion ( 61 % ) .    3.9555776000393212
arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of baker ' s cyst .    3.0997143450298337
postoperative complications were two UNK due to one hematoma and one effusion .    3.5880248246818782
patient ' s evaluation of operation result was " excellent " in 61 % and " good " in 39 % of cases .    3.172042037999968
all knee joints had a full range of motion .    3.2503091270807922
there was only one case of a recurrent cyst .    3.5329543075075316
the primary form of baker ' s cyst has always to be extirpated , according to our clinical experience .    2.863526462914884
in median UNK ligament syndrome , compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries .    3.5534805153752873
a lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment .    3.779345835340454
depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways , the symptoms vary considerably .    3.834713788487161
we report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two - vessel involvement .    2.7079124502509075
in such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit .    2.973512104376547
usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient .    3.079674175724774
bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow .    3.422387041814518
the microscopic examination of UNK - stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique .    4.281792410596282
recently , methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available .    2.834781574371265
the use of an antigen - UNK assay for the detection of UNK - rich protein 2 , an antigen specific for UNK UNK , forms the basis of the UNK - f ( UNK UNK ) and the ict malaria pf test ( ict diagnostics ) .    4.26384056939155
parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another UNK UNK assay developed by flow inc .    3.7710368562963983
these currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and UNK of 90 - 100 % .    3.9497926592193027
a decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low UNK .    4.261562925524176
however , false - negative results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities .    3.6385033193117056
purpose : discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes .    3.4023807724202273
there is no information about the frequency of nerve lesions after revascularization of the lower limb .    3.63463989872488
methods : between 1992 and 1996 , 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization , including 147 cases of deep revascularization , 127 supra - genicular femoro - popliteal bypasses , 116 infra - genicular femoro - popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro - crural bypasses .    2.3505249426342085
mean patient age was 70 . 5 + / - 5 . 8 years ; 182 patients were female and UNK were male .    3.3828690945948674
there was a 38 % rate ( 166 / 436 ) of reoperation .    2.864120876789166
all patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation , including the methods of weber and UNK .    3.1695604185457746
results : we found eleven patients ( 4 % ) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation .    3.5878013232430277
after the reoperation 55 patients ( 33 % ) had nerve lesions .    3.1999026881380273
conclusions : peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15 % of our patients on discharge from hospital .    3.574475353015263
they had mainly dysesthesia and UNK but no kind of motor dysfunction .    2.8974397959739795
in our opinion , detailed preoperative information is very important because of the risk of sensitive nerve lesions .    3.5461829291494644
classic and hiv - associated kaposi ' s sarcoma ( ks ) are predominantly found in male UNK .    3.344155316571619
it is unclear why ks is so rare in women .    2.8528098262762875
at the department of dermatology , university of frankfurt , epidemic ks was diagnosed in UNK / UNK ( 40 % ) male and 5 / 72 ( 18 % ) female hiv - infected patients .    3.398039325548028
to detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency , hormonal disturbances , abnormalities in clinical course , or sexual practices , data of eight women with ks ( five hiv + , three hiv - ) were compared .    3.225586982220865
in hiv + women ks is more aggressive than in hiv - women and more aggressive than in hiv + men .    2.939025845637767
compared to hiv - women with ks , hiv + women are generally younger ( mean age 38 vs 71 years ) and significantly UNK ( reduced absolute cd4 cell count and cd4 / cd8 ratio ) .    3.0542399822094124
all women with ks investigated for sexual hormones ( 7 / 8 ) showed abnormalities : 7 / 7 had low oestrogens , 4 / 6 low UNK and 3 / 5 low progesterone .    3.2161112173075894
controls ( n = 11 , hiv + without ks ) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones , but the difference was not significant .    3.4378084454305413
although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens ( drug abuse , UNK , menopause ) must be considered , the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in hiv + and hiv - women with ks .    3.921360972600963
there was no correlation between sexual practices ( anal or oral - UNK contacts ) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of ks .    2.9829231056092804
the aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular ( lv ) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement ( avr ) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of lv hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired lv systolic function prior to surgery .    3.4770388795490192
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis ( 29 female , 45 male , mean age 66 + / - 18 years ) were divided into 2 groups according to lv ejection fraction ( ef ) : group 1 with ef > 50 % ( n = 40 ) ; group 2 with ef < = 50 % ( n = 34 ) .    3.832788869901048
furthermore , patients were differentiated into a group a without ( n = 53 ) and a group b with aortic regurgitation ( < = ii ° , n = 21 ) .    3.8304156392095163
all patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery .    2.954168164350039
there was a significant decrease of lv UNK and UNK UNK indices following avr in group 2 and group b .    3.311402003224875
patients with preoperatively lower ef ( group 2 ) showed an increase in lv ejection fraction from 39 + / - 10 % before avr to 47 + / - 11 % after avr ( p < 0 . 001 ) , whereas patients with preoperative normal ef ( group 1 ) showed a significant decrease in ef ( from 62 + / - 8 % to 57 + / - 10 % , p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.478852263944295
also patients with combined aortic valve disease before avr had an increase of ef after surgery ( from 45 % UNK ; 14 % to 56 + / - 14 % , p < 0 . 03 ) .    3.4884248052514275
there were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and lv posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group a , whereas a significant decrease of lv UNK diameter index was noted only in group b .    3.0145949446788345
in conclusion , patients with impaired lv function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after avr , while patients with normal lv function presented a slight decrease of ef .    3.4132826019461326
there was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status .    3.6208501510628133
subsequently , irreversible cellular damage , e . g . , during myocardial infarction , causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue .    3.180602856057772
it is , therefore , not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest .    2.878173852657245
in other species such as mice , rats , and dogs , the technical feasibility of skeletal UNK - , satellite cell - , and fetal cardiomyocyte UNK into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods .    3.1448851591953724
repeatedly , it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as UNK junctions and desmosomes .    3.425942433734512
in contrast , UNK connections have not , as yet , been convincingly demonstrated .    2.7842320733633112
however , clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells , and , thus , of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells , remains to be demonstrated .    3.1744835835044922
concomitant with advances in medicine , involving the development and use of antibiotics , immunosuppressive drugs , organ / stem cell transplantation and pre - existing illnesses such as aids , the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically .    3.5251632081356044
these factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease .    3.4279168512583658
purpose : we evaluated the speed of sound ( sos ) and broadband ultrasound UNK ( bua ) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age - related changes in ultrasound values in normal women .    3.1528440625507916
materials and methods : bua and sos were measured in UNK women using the " achilles " UNK ( UNK , UNK , ohio ) .    3.6765767137480347
from the bua and sos values the bua / sos index ( " stiffness " index ) is calculated .    2.6864462953175376
we investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis ( aged 43 - 85 years ) and 181 healthy women ( aged 20 - 80 years ) .    3.272068030899084
results : ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group .    3.267075053300354
the z - score compared with young normals was higher for the bua / sos index ( - 3 . 1 ) than for bua ( - 2 . 5 ) and sos ( - 3 . 0 ) .    3.5829716886709897
at a bua / sos index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 % , and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures .    3.7971154004523453
we found a significant decline with age in sos ( r = - 0 . 55 ) , bua ( r = - 0 . 50 ) and bua / sos index ( r = - 0 . 57 ) .    2.7894589725287835
conclusion : ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis .    3.4188702422174297
a treatment procedure requires the consent of the patient , but this is legally effective only if he is capable of giving his consent and can be informed accordingly .    3.396406498091205
because of demographic development and the progress of medicine , the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing .    3.9423852924874927
in practice , we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or , for procedures that can wait , with the consent of legitimate family members .    3.274719290277773
an initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this UNK zone and the forensic risks UNK .    3.1638332139089513
a number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events / life conditions and depression .    2.793186440316924
however , there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events / life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype .    3.7700116782432453
the present study examines the significance of the patients ' life events / life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months .    3.593393277141448
patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode .    3.7434321068506544
the results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in - patients .    3.3942066532663127
relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non - relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse .    3.092566020466441
depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation .    3.504918279953764
since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997 , there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged , mainly metabolic changes such as UNK , hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia .    3.110026842090884
besides , fat redistribution has been observed .    2.7212224016394613
fat UNK in the face and limbs but UNK in the adipose tissue of the UNK and abdominal region and the breasts .    5.454514040588282
for therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried .    2.7018257733360063
29 of our 224 patients developed UNK .    3.1900218465544246
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor ( 17 patients with UNK ) ; 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors .    4.479107254752529
background : the low - vision - enhancement - system ( UNK ) is the first binocular UNK rehabilitation device with variable focus distance .    3.6236285924178406
dna - cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the who - classification .    4.1562985141350275
in this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three UNK were investigated .    3.259086027913779
in all cases the histological type and who - grade and the ki - 67 / mib1 labeling index were determined .    2.7815506043499583
dna cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on UNK - stained preparations , and the following parameters were calculated : stemline UNK , UNK - exceeding rate , and UNK - deviation index .    4.58456555897309
there is a world - wide UNK of neurosurgical treatments of parkinson ' s disease ( pd ) , based on substantial progress in basic sciences .    2.8904721204791657
the internal globus pallidus ( gpi ) is an essential UNK as it connects to UNK projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus UNK ( nst ) .    3.2837180505524244
lesioning of these targets has been successful in UNK damaged primates .    3.3783573437195193
there is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and UNK UNK .    4.128572115090789
UNK and UNK have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting .    3.9568836289335096
the first technic is used for treatment of rigidity , hypokinesia and dyskinesias , the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor .    3.4410329073509724
dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells ; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems .    3.2534269240235774
the continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the UNK technic ; it is highly UNK to the patient ' s need and carries a low morbidity profile .    3.877901958717141
UNK stimulation is used for the treatment of tremor .    4.390958680036509
the stimulation of nst and gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on / off phenomena .    2.707077807350052
animal research further focuses on UNK and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells .    3.2196658056324448
- in summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be UNK promising ; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best ( combination ) treatment ( s ) for the future .    3.611875426822215
concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands , but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern .    3.338368950944192
even though the need for effective documentation ( i . e . , adequate in content , availability , feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis ) is not a question , tasks and aims ( for example , quality of patient care ) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed .    3.1773989017976723
the medtronic thera / thera - i ( and kappa 400 ) pacemakers utilize a mode switching algorithm that switches from the ddd / r mode to the UNK mode in the presence on an atrial tachyarrhythmia .    3.2398204766894922
to accomplish this , the pacemaker keeps track of a mean atrial rate ( mar ) which is a weighted index of the atrial rate .    3.5466482154543866
once the mar is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode .    2.8566369795234428
because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates , the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias , including those with varying amplitudes .    3.1639568265484943
additionally , the algorithm provides a long UNK and a rate adaptive ( ra ) av interval .    3.301383142767719
these not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected , but may also limit the time the patient UNK at the upper rate before mode switching .    3.6274013657910253
in order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm , the thera - i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date , time , duration , and rate of the mode switch episodes .    3.3812666885581204
additionally , more detailed beat - to - beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes .    2.979731128377307
there is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases .    3.7587867418041845
for dermatological patients such data are not available .    3.09532306342402
in early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the ruhr university bochum .    3.223674132516618
we used the german version of the internationally accepted hospital anxiety and depression scale .    2.8433378988956335
we found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25 , 9 % and 31 % .    3.1948160004546096
the prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological , cardiological or neurological patient populations .    3.0839827558527446
surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or UNK diseases .    3.793711291070599
these results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated .    2.91606834042063
in an analysis of 3 , UNK UNK car drivers , the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997 .    4.06164332187051
these injuries occurred mainly in the case of head - on or multiple collisions .    3.7516148629524317
letters were sent to 1 , 136 of the injured persons , and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires , 121 ( 88 % ) were still suffering from their symptoms .    3.5993095062824305
it was a question of pain ( 74 % ) , tension ( 6 % ) and stiffness ( 5 % ) in the head ( 27 % ) , neck ( 55 % ) and shoulder ( 8 % ) area .    4.738446872555406
the duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions .    2.896954045362996
in addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints , the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor .    3.664011299473396
in order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study , prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis , treatment protocols , duration and type of complaints .    3.4435677204711355
large b - cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non - hodgkin - lymphomas ( 30 - 40 % ) .    3.6560859549103353
they are characterised by an aggressive clinical course .    3.176667064940499
these lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma .    3.205593334130256
in addition to primary nodal , a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common .    2.9983604314425056
the neoplastic cells , even within one given case , show a broad morphological spectrum .    3.2040795484831235
several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large b - cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group .    3.4919464718732307
this fact has been taken into account by the new who classification of malignant lymphomas .    3.643011951566085
there are two groups identified , that of the variants and that of the subtypes .    3.565160361715406
the various variants ( UNK , immunoblastic , anaplastic , t - cell / UNK - rich ) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical , UNK and genetic findings .    3.765595089925008
in contrast , the primary mediastinal , the intravascular , the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities .    3.0200897967996334
a number of recently described large cell lymphoma types , i . e . UNK , alk - positive and primary gastric , are included in the classification , their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion .    3.4713532091594246
in the presented study , knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated .    3.7132391032254115
in a control group , the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic UNK knee joints was examined .    3.25275344477974
we tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test .    3.1616574510630593
the patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability ( 13 . 2 ° + / - 6 . 1 ° ) compared to the control group ( 7 . 8 ° + / - 2 . 8 ° ) .    4.143017587952548
after applying an elastic knee bandage , the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9 . 2 ° + / - 4 . 5 ° .    3.3657378308837824
proprioception of the contralateral , UNK knee joint in the patients ( 11 . 6 ° + / - 6 . 3 ° ) was worse compared to the control group .    4.431130043301412
applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint .    2.850240064444219
atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men .    3.557716278718679
it is associated with a two - fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers .    3.691977846055961
the relative UNK and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies .    3.2012692117427775
ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two UNK strategies : ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation .    2.7665091386945226
it has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus .    3.0576706074395186
these ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated , thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation .    2.6310636869018555
most often , these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins .    3.309363747479679
a challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study .    2.7525258836359168
to UNK the need of mapping , pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions .    3.3786566787701973
in patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation , efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation .    2.7938261593568785
strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant UNK requiring a critical myocardial mass to UNK .    3.3486779908680027
several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative UNK of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation .    3.1787492474415884
currently , attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using UNK , catheter - based approaches .    3.2532898182778442
though our knowledge of ablation techniques and technical prerequisites is continuously increasing , the difficulty to produce complete linear lesions in the left atrium and local thrombus formation at the ablation line are problems that are still not solved .    3.256288489246746
using a time - budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design , substantial reductions in the engagement of non - obligatory instrumental , social , and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients .    3.3366119876448006
controlling these changes for differences in baseline UNK , the dementia - specific reduction was about 1 , 5 hours compared to a non - psychiatric control group .    4.127438482321173
these clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia .    3.553291706311149
time - budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness .    3.523366297441283
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( hcm ) is a disease with different etiological , morphological , functional , clinical and therapeutic aspects .    3.6074057519012297
recent investigations indicate that hcm is considerably widespread in the population ( 1 : 500 ) .    3.0037526408899997
the causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities ( mutations ) .    2.7315745131782623
depending on the clinical aspect , the complaints , and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results , we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management .    3.890565635350226
atrial fibrillation is in 20 - 50 % the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) and a possible cause for UNK complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients .    3.807608360338753
200 patients after cabg were randomized in a drug and control group ( average age 63 . 2 years , 154 male , 46 female ) .    3.6366854044024235
patients of the drug group ( n = 100 ) were treated with metoprolol ( UNK / kg / bw ) beginning on day one after operation , whereas patients of the control group ( n = 100 ) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial UNK .    3.8830858199534237
ecg , blood pressure , and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery .    3.3037494680626325
reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction ( < 30 % , sa - and av - block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol .    3.3371594040250265
however , a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups , 4 patients of the therapy group ( 4 % ) in contrast to 37 patients of the control ( 37 % ) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .    4.035656349493306
both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1 . 5 days ( control group : 9 . 83 + / - 2 . 88 days ; drug group : 8 . 42 + / - 2 . 81 days ) , which was statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.563656632315317
all patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable UNK , whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation .    3.5301530999803
the difference was statistically significant as well ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.680048755662645
neither typical side effects of metoprolol , nor av - blocks , bradycardia ( f < 60 / min ) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed .    3.201067742316209
the conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol / day after coronary artery bypass surgery , which can reduce the incidence of sva as well as the hospital stay statistically significant .    3.7244932260745607
especially by using the " functional muscular diagnostics " described by UNK specific muscular imbalances can be found .    3.3838042507741695
the method is easy to apply and should be used during and before the UNK UNK .    3.6136487952090137
background : angiotensin converting enzyme - inhibitors ( ace - inhibitors ) alter the function of the renin - angiotensin - UNK - system , which regulates the angiotensin ii synthesis .    3.2075989071472977
UNK ii is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor .    4.268205735239508
ace - inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the who - guidelines .    4.276078138134329
the experiences concerning the use of ace - inhibitors in pediatric patients are limited .    3.694347041790085
the frequency of side - effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis .    3.442063516501319
evoked potentials ( ep ) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co - operation .    3.46691045710557
different modalities of short latency ep can be applied to evaluate sensory , auditory and visual systems .    3.145563236557996
in this review we discuss ep studies in patients with thrombosis of basilar artery , space occupying cerebellar infarction and supratentorial mass lesions of different aetiology .    2.9693350686676756
paclitaxel , a potent anti - tumor agent , shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and UNK stable UNK .    2.9162939176999227
these cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation , migration , and signal transduction .    3.013188676956634
it is highly lipophilic , which promotes a rapid cellular uptake , and has a long - lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton .    3.783967014631244
this makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis .    2.7418406853253234
in this article , results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented .    2.8557987164754834
cell culture experiments with UNK of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as UNK with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1 . 0 - 10 . UNK / l , even after a short ( 20 min ) single dose application .    4.139772284286278
the comparison of an active , semi - active , and passive delivery system ( porous balloon , microporous balloon , and double balloon ) favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments .    3.015000120252968
tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel - induced vessel wall alterations .    3.201000780963631
in the rabbit model , locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced UNK formation and enlargement in vessel size ; in the pig model , however , after stenting , this inhibition was not significant .    3.0946373033101158
both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton , which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments .    3.230768344536364
atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases , with a still increasing incidence .    3.840768874729167
although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood , a variety of triggering factors are known .    3.6235663525861406
the following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2 - year - old boy in whom both ige - mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions .    3.101601695686001
this demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be .    3.2749526763018157
identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes .    3.0838805476232274
a model is being presented UNK that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an " imaginary self " consisting of phantasies and UNK without taking into account facts and social UNK .    3.072731434765519
the " imaginary self " stabilizes irritating self deficiencies , thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual UNK of adaptation .    2.7448655387050067
biomaterials are defined as non - living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems .    3.613232543039219
especially in the field of UNK , biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion , urinary incontinence , erectile dysfunction , and as cosmetic prostheses .    3.55363335508827
biomaterial - tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial , its degradation , and the resulting protein UNK .    4.298526451095958
general requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic , UNK , toxic , and allergic reactions .    3.6091923342522003
this ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue , which may lead to UNK and UNK .    3.620321391650261
continuous modification of known materials , inauguration of new materials , as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come .    3.629237323379043
hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently .    4.144435006334046
in this paper , under the UNK , that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right , the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method .    3.210774188028756
it is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient .    3.0053720180385275
first , a series of diagnostic , structural , motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed .    3.0548659973768038
as cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance , in the context of group psychotherapy , the UNK for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions .    3.8912647364532806
the conclusion is that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy , would preferably be indicated for those patients who suffer from constraints of emotional competence as stemming from developmental deficits .    2.8104664092998632
purpose : to evaluate method - and user effects as well as the required time in the determination of left - and right ventricular ejection fractions in comparing manual and semiautomatic border detection of the endocardium .    3.3492948867675776
the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss .    3.050499377817559
between january 1995 and january 1997 , we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria ( > = 10 UNK per microscope field ( UNK ) and significant UNK ( > = ; 105 / ml ) combined with vaginal contamination ( UNK of squamous epithelial cells , mixed bacterial growth ) .    3.1403615837209418
results : in 55 % ( 17 / 31 ) , diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization ; in 26 % ( 8 / 31 ) , urinary tract infection could be excluded , and in 19 % ( 6 / 31 ) , bladder colonization without pyuria was found .    3.3903355089161735
thus , 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need UNK .    3.4613644603972733
after single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg ciprofloxacin , given immediately after catheterization , no infectious complications occurred .    3.055560827346267
diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple , safe and - compared to UNK aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non - conclusive voided urine samples .    3.4810713073281554
most people with the metabolic syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions , mostly myocardial infarction .    2.928514032309794
type - 2 - diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications , but often clusters with UNK , hypertension and obesity .    3.8864823183304003
this is referred to as " metabolic syndrome " and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which UNK the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific UNK .    3.43702786579336
from a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the UNK of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques .    3.4566723071853347
in patients with the metabolic syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a UNK state , involving increased UNK coagulation , diminished fibrinolysis , decreased endothelial UNK and predominantly platelet UNK ( " diabetic UNK " ) .    2.8641050797248653
some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk ( e . g .    2.8692079806724107
fibrinogen , pai - 1 , platelets ) , but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of " UNK " .    4.182466094523748
altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of UNK organs , decreased success of acute ( reduced fibrinolytic response , no UNK phenomenon ) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency ( ptca , cabg ) in diabetes .    2.958059712892338
glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms , but in the situation of myocardial infarction UNK with parenteral glucose - insulin - potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non - diabetics .    3.3605392066367816
on the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the metabolic syndrome including antihypertensive , UNK and antithrombotic drugs , UNK according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures ( " early secondary prevention " ) .    3.5106447343704708
the indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain , progressive sliding and , in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation , from radicular malfunction .    3.5277714279459964
the posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure , but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation .    3.662743305855815
with the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible , with an acceptable neurological risk .    3.518880804000136
therefore a concept of treatment is suggested , which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated UNK beside stabilization and UNK decompression .    3.1094727637472266
depending on the extent of the slip , reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one , two or three stages .    3.71074036496817
an anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade i dislocation .    3.084609368752739
in grade ii - v a combined posterior and anterior surgical UNK is recommended .    3.3550257884094776
objectives : this study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of UNK brachial plexus anaesthesia ( UNK ) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery .    3.423451207183131
the original method described by UNK bears some rare but life - threatening complications ( inadvertent subarachnoid or intra - arterial injection , pneumothorax ) .    2.967307071581944
objectives : due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism , desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low - flow anaesthetic techniques .    2.780955938284648
the aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low - flow and minimal - flow desflurane anaesthesia .    3.1658634373518453
methods : one hundred six asa status i - ii patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high - flow phase , fresh gas flow , and fresh - gas desflurane concentration .    3.078035446926417
the median age , height , body weight , and constitution of the groups was comparable .    2.994841314895948
after an initial high - flow phase using 4 . 4 l / min , the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0 . 5 l / min ( minimal - flow anaesthesia ) or 1 . 0 l / min ( low - flow anaesthesia ) .    3.0005284430011647
inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60 % to 70 % .    3.197376722698229
using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings , inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3 . 4 % to 8 . 7 % , i . e . , between 1 and 1 . 5 mac .    4.050705370314277
inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side - stream technique and recorded on - line .    3.185125324983028
venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of UNK ( cohb ) concentration ) .    3.428285087439613
results : in the 10 - to 15 - min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4 . 4 l / min was used , the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90 % - 95 % of the fresh gas concentration .    3.5416060485013117
in low - flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting , whereas in minimal - flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1 % to 2 % : the quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration ( q = ci / cf ) ranges between 0 . 65 and 0 . 75 in minimal - flow and between 0 . 80 and 0 . 85 in low - flow anaesthesia .    3.2776191380126467
if use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer , the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5 % in 8 min , although the flow was kept constant at 0 . 5 l / min .    3.114100758102171
compared with its value prior to induction ( 2 . 13 + / - 1 . 05 % ) , the cohb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0 . 7 % during the 1st hour of minimal - flow anaesthesia ( 1 . 42 + / - 1 . 01 % ) .    4.039465481912481
in no case was a cohb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values , although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week .    3.044758050493282
conclusions : the pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane , resulting in especially low individual uptake , and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low - flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice .    3.3423704268256422
even in minimal - flow anaesthesia , the duration of the initial high - flow phase can be shortened to min .    2.662642674926078
if the flow is reduced to 1 l / min , the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high - flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting .    2.7263267626237893
in minimal - flow anaesthesia , however , with flow reduction to 0 . 5 l / min , the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1 % - 2 % higher than the inspired UNK value .    3.6935876841998136
due to the wide UNK range of the desflurane vaporizer , the amount of UNK delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml / min even at a flow of 0 . 5 l / min .    3.284693117776327
the large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low - flow conditions , together with the very low individual uptake , results in a time - constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations .    3.498542905023536
the short time - constant of low - flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration .    3.699978848673897
if all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime , there is no evidence that low - flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca    3.581110999372973
arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis .    3.518050558427303
specific complications are rarely documented in literature .    3.3315192809392737
the perforation of an arterial port - a - UNK followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy .    3.2950964653305124
besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents , such as vomiting , sickness , or gastritis and UNK , UNK ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment .    4.100001125899251
based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy .    3.047322811362438
background : coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations , projected in different parts of the body .    2.822143444931776
patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia .    3.130140891947986
these symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception .    2.981152586860655
UNK must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases , e . g . , schizophrenia .    3.700242999206857
however , in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases , e . g . , intracranial tumors or infections .    2.939816857003009
therefore , accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important .    3.237961901185211
in late stages , coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their " bizarre " character .    2.8102631076661027
in early stages , however , patients often complain of intractable , UNK burning pain .    3.446381592684707
they frequently undergo operations because of their great suffering .    3.307773688735491
the drug treatment of first choice is neuroleptics , but the results are unpredictable .    4.319755454704958
question : what risks do different forms of immunosuppression ( azathioprine , cyclosporin , azathioprine / cyclosporin plus steroids ) represent in pregnancy for the mother and fetus after kidney transplantation ?    3.00855714844452
retrospective analysis of 40 pregnancies and deliveries .    3.4303390195554107
investigation of abortion - , premature birth rate , fetal retardation , malformation , hospitalization , UNK of labour , birth weight , gestational age , perinatal mortality , hypertonia , preeclampsia , anemia , kidney function , rejection crisis , mechanical compression , kidney function after 1 and 5 years postpartum .    3.0337104027628854
recommendation guideline : preconceptional time ( contraception ) and intensive care in pregnancy .    3.4742780117307426
the risk of pregnancy is justified if the UNK are correct and the woman would urgently like to have a child .    3.6925633425343167
studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior .    3.263026581775904
in this study , the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated , paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment .    3.175810475640925
two approaches , one oriented toward the subject ' s experience of the home environment , another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual ' s favorite place , were employed .    3.255034072218947
is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various UNK were found in the experience of cognitive , biographical , and spatial dimensions of the living environment .    3.4654725135952993
similarities were found in the experience of emotional , social , and behavioral dimensions of one ' s home .    3.6543196171763843
competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home , yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped .    3.1936824012947636
the environment - oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density .    3.384867583627843
finally , an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person - and environment - oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment .    2.779926872487157
even though the subjective experience of one ' s home environment is not easily UNK in terms of maintaining everyday competence , it nonetheless UNK meaning to the elderly person ' s daily life .    3.02756726957566
the main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation ( posterior fixation suture ) for the treatment of essential infantile UNK is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive UNK .    3.329410321607969
nevertheless , this unwanted complication also occasionally occurs after a faden operation .    2.765760611886582
we report the rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma involving the minor salivary glands in the buccal mucosa of a 78 - year - old female .    2.8293988170679767
tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass .    3.2425825773107726
the initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma , while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma .    3.2988476775601736
recurrences of tumor after 2 and then 5 years were excised .    3.8329082210001464
histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma .    3.5437664982907977
the clinical features , therapy , diagnosis , histopathology and literature are reviewed .    2.997948129086846
the purpose of this prospective study was to determine concomittant lesions of glenohumeral dislocation and their correlation with the outcome , to determine the influence of various stabilizing operation techniques on the outcome .    3.5248172730849148
106 shoulders [ 104 patients , 81 men , 23 women , mean age 36 ( 16 - 83 ) years ] operated because of shoulder instability after at minimum one shoulder luxation between 1988 to 1995 were evaluated 3 years ( 0 . 8 - 8 years ) postoperatively using constant score .    3.3998216055881385
preoperative arthroscopy was performed to document intraarticular lesions .    3.454358490315942
there were 7 UNK ( 5 because of a new accident ) , mostly after putti - platt procedures .    3.4113876887894725
the average modified constant score was 66 ( 10 - 85 ) points ( maximum 85 ) .    3.122673010327316
29 patients ( 27 % ) had less than 60 points , mostly because of pain and restriction of function , and were evaluated as poor .    3.9293172862600656
lesions of rotator cuff , long biceps tendon and subscapularis tendon had a bad prognosis .    2.8278498213429395
the severity of arthroscopically found lesions correlated with the outcome .    3.2163227352377457
operations with shortening of subscapularis tendon or using a bone graft gave bad results .    3.0008809035111073
anatomic reconstruction of the labrum - ligament complex in combination with a plasty of the extended capsule gave best results .    3.6215738220369538
preoperative arthroscopy can determine the extent of different lesions after shoulder luxation which influence the outcome and is useful to select the optimal operation technique .    3.3730415659339763
prenatal determination of fetal blood groups by dna amplification today is possible for UNK d , ee , cc , UNK ( UNK / 2 ) , UNK ( UNK / b ) and UNK ( UNK / b ) .    3.7107192894968737
current assays using multiplex pcr and at least two specific primers as well as an intern control offer a diagnostic power of more than 99 % .    3.4831100203818983
in all pregnancies complicated by irregular blood group antibodies , blood group typing in amniotic fluid allows to reduce the number of invasive procedures .    3.0910039725022957
pcr typing is recommended in all cases with a heterozygous father and an increased antibody level or suspicious findings during ultrasound evaluation .    3.4012339306008457
adjuvant therapy with interferon for malignant melanoma causes neurotoxic side effects such as depression .    3.1954150905535736
the biochemical mechanisms are unknown .    3.0035094586252002
we report two cases with both depression and amnesia .    2.6317663300107705
in one case , attempted suicide was a UNK by 7 h of amnesia .    3.09542970862517
the diagnostic classification and possible explanations for the amnesia secondary to interferon therapy are reviewed .    2.8937789142772914
molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic UNK ( hpv ) types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix .    3.141176120928551
this statement is also true , albeit with reservations as yet , of other so - called high - risk hpv types , such as hpv 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 and 58 .    3.359318966901994
around 500 , 000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year , and 1 - 4 % of all younger women have a UNK of the cervix UNK .    4.236266961254563
this knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses , however .    3.674142341164023
this is mainly because infection with genital hpv types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma .    2.77021689901172
in this review , therefore , the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with hpv .    3.6482646620338985
in addition , the molecular biological data on hpv as it relates to anogenital carcinogenesis are presented .    2.5645447201987013
in conclusion , the significance of hpv for the prevention of carcinoma of the cervix is discussed .    2.991793350382211
we report the case of a 43 - year - old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction .    2.752128166715837
her husband and a general practitioner living in the UNK initially performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation .    3.952414508547844
a prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he UNK after 20 minutes .    3.1373220081541224
it was impossible to achieve stable rhythm by 42 attemps of defibrillation .    2.90790562277273
therefore , the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation .    3.2468751602985293
a UNK was informed with radio signal .    2.8927577582720354
percutaneous cardiopulmonary support ( pcps ) was implanted in the emergency department after 100 minutes of cardiac arrest .    3.309413201693975
after stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pcps ( 4 - 5 l / min ) it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory .    3.6209909653359613
angiography revealed proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery .    3.019224696091444
after successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation .    3.0664454459406945
by use of intra - aortic balloon pump ( iabp ) the flow rate of pcps was reduced every two hours .    2.947595746725308
after 10 hours of support pcps was UNK .    3.115903749171495
iabp was needed for three days .    3.6841292502594927
the patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks .    2.6994960052045753
by using pcps it is possible to stabilize the patient ' s hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice .    3.27415681720822
the use of pcps in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising .    3.0340101996418567
the long - term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study .    3.490097970409741
from 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and / or the skull base underwent surgery .    3.702192538849089
all patients ' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards .    2.968771598931823
the results following reconstruction with autologous calvarian transplants in 52 patients were compared to those of a control group which received iliac bone or pmma implants .    3.388951310365867
eighty - one bony defects ( 64 % ) resulted from tumor resection ; 37 patients ( 29 % ) suffered from the effects of trauma .    3.2477190128062654
in 67 cases ( 53 % ) reconstruction was performed primarily , in 51 cases ( 40 % ) secondarily .    3.429577302251117
free or pedicled soft - tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the UNK in 26 % of the defects .    4.73392276244396
on the other hand , small , isolated defects of the orbital roof ( 7 % ) were left without any reconstructive procedure .    3.4413408476898892
contrary to the iliac bone grafts , the calvarian transplants UNK secondary resorption .    3.2713019659190157
postoperative infections appeared in two cases ; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the UNK .    3.6452195942729757
the selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with UNK led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects .    3.4458757476200743
within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined .    3.432466652722846
usually verbal interventions of different UNK and settings ( e . g .    2.9411441191633516
individual and group therapy ) , nonverbal procedures ( e . g .    3.056639916215483
music and art therapy ) and UNK techniques are included .    4.557491723456445
the combinations is merely additive , integrated or UNK .    3.0720024868956104
little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations .    2.953550350414725
along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for UNK and obsessive disorders a rationale for the UNK of the different therapeutic components is discussed .    3.608633239454947
we report an 18 - year old woman with surgically proven primary hyperparathyroidism ( phpt ) and normal intact parathyroid hormone ( ipth ) serum levels .    2.941352714081956
diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated ipth level .    3.2559475580295056
viral hepatitis belongs to the most important infectious diseases worldwide .    3.2717807103858467
more than 300 million chronic hbsag carriers and chronic hcv carriers exist , respectively .    2.67417593840868
high endemic areas of viral hepatitis are asia , africa , UNK america and the near , middle and far east .    2.9395005834433445
viral hepatitis is also very important in health care workers .    3.548622506206958
today viral hepatitis can be differentiated from type a to type e ( g ) based on immunological and molecular assays .    3.236659901144147
while enterally transmitted hepatitis type a and type e only induce acute and rare fulminant disease , hepatitis type b , c and d often induce chronic progressive disease including liver cirrhosis with typical complications due to the portal hypertension and with a high rate of association with the development of primary liver cancer ( hcc ) .    3.585394738819349
hypertensive diseases in pregnancy ( hdp ) are one of the most frequent causes of maternal death and perinatal mortality .    3.081852851208101
however , chronic hypertension without complications has a more favorable prognosis than preeclampsia .    3.0883958633374404
apart from a familial predisposition , mutations of various genes may also be responsible ; among these , apc resistance is of particular clinical significance .    3.279484862132844
the insufficient endovascular invasion of UNK in the spiral UNK is still considered to represent the pathogenetic basis of preeclampsia .    3.8759758785488323
increased lipid oxidation , UNK membrane components of UNK , and increased invasion of fetal cells in the maternal circulation triggering immunological reactions are discussed as the causes .    3.948661731810903
the result is an endothelial imbalance between UNK - UNK and UNK - UNK compounds .    4.344886077456064
the results of studies on the relevance of no synthase are controversial .    2.9668874463937076
currently , neither reliable methods for the early detection nor certain UNK measures to avoid the disease are available .    3.541480563148699
intensive care monitoring and therapy are essential for pregnant women with severe hdp .    3.73190324764635
the obstetric procedure depends on the severity and dynamics of the disease as well as the state of development of the baby .    4.402245482029284
when the pregnancy is continued defined guidelines for its termination for maternal or fetal indications must be taken into consideration .    2.5606464370067052
after delivery , the mother must be intensively monitored for at least 24 to 48 hours ( UNK eclampsia / hellp syndrome ) .    2.9571649921620176
the risk for recurrence of the preeclampsia is between 20 and 26 % or when it occurred in the second trimester up to 65 % while that of hellp syndrome is between 3 . 5 and 24 % .    3.652114674505083
acanthosis nigricans is a hyperkeratotic mucocutaneous eruption of heterogenous etiology which is characterized by hyperpigmentation , UNK cutaneous thickening , intensified skin UNK and development of verrucous UNK typically involving the intertriginous areas .    3.1005899332443594
malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis .    3.4907339084083886
we report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder .    2.516886066105405
symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes .    3.0479603915291893
the goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution , the gerontopsychiatric center ( gc : a combination of a home - based outpatient service , a day - hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders ) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures , as experts of the government of the frg have been demanding for a long time .    3.289680806018904
based on data of cross - sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of UNK ( without gc , control region ) and the district of UNK ( with gc ) - are compared and analyzed , whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system ( subsystem a ) , the system of general medical treatment ( subsystem b ) , or within the elderly care system ( subsystem c ) occurred .    3.7722123127042457
concerning subsystem a the results are that the gc has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra - to extramural structures , without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities .    3.0830568964102274
the home - based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder .    3.1878445102361304
these patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self - care deficits within one year effects of the gc on subsystem b were evident soon after its establishment , for example , by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with gc , in which ( hospitals ) two UNK of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis ( icd - 9 ) are treated .    3.925005401837013
an effect of the gc on subsystem c is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without gc .    3.7771165691066515
in the field of UNK it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system .    2.994560893751092
one approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research .    3.3823185450750484
while the phenomenon of stress - induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted , more recent studies focus on possible UNK and mechanisms of these responses .    3.1566761982406013
within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis .    3.1590432582782104
the present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress - induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release .    3.5581725391718813
moreover , the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort .    2.7609826396053614
using a " public speaking paradigm " we were able to UNK previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of cd8 + and cd56 + cells in peripheral blood .    2.993878410788128
moreover , when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders , the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects .    2.9370835799030703
however , high and low catecholamine responders did not differ with respect to subjective ratings on discomfort .    3.105520937492677
the data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine - induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy .    3.06674102229344
we report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma ( rhe ) on the right great toe in a 40 - year - old woman .    2.8083056861345175
there was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg .    2.914035658544403
histologically , primary lesion , local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion ( soft tissue metastasis ? )    3.245218481053146
the concept and the group of low - grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed , with special emphasis on inclusion of rhe in this category .    3.5039752596781946
hmsn is a hereditary symmetric ascending neuropathy of the peripherial nerves .    3.1906673191786665
several cases of hmsn with motility disorders of both eyes have been reported in the literature .    2.868112095736894
we describe a patient with hmsn type 1 and an incomplete peripherial 3rd nerve palsy of the right eye .    3.213481415252492
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of developed unilateral oculomotor disorder in a patient with hmsn .    2.6251545068743742
a 34 - year - old male ( UNK cm / 100 kg ) was scheduled for surgery of the nasal septum .    3.456730280856121
he had had uneventful anaesthesia for UNK 14 years earlier : following 600 mg thiopentone , 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol . % halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) were recorded .    2.818142825932754
following oral premedication with 2 mg UNK at 7 . UNK a . m . anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at 8 . 45 a . m . followed by 0 . 2 mg fentanyl , 500 mg thiopentone , and 100 mg suxamethonium .    3.1503134749945083
endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [ 9 ] , and the patient was ventilated UNK in a semi - closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed .    3.528653336281982
enflurane ( 1 . 5 % for 5 min , 1 . 0 % for 10 min , and 0 . 8 % until the diagnosis of mh was suspected ) was given in 33 % o2 / 66 % n2o .    4.737799224383177
seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10 / min and 6 l / min , respectively , to 20 / min and 12 l / min .    3.413531767523631
attempts at UNK anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0 . 95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation .    3.7208820352592
in spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l / min and assisted manual ventilation , the fio2 started to fall from 0 . 34 to 0 . 28 at 10 : 20 a . m .    3.233740451784132
the o2 / n2o ratio was changed to 1 : 1 , but the fio2 remained at 0 . 3 .    4.384110473102031
mh was suspected , enflurane was discontinued , and an arterial blood gas analysis was done ( table 2 ) .    3.387410792321783
when marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found , UNK 2 . 5 mg / kg was given , the operation was terminated , and the patient ' s trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h . vital signs were stable ( table 3 ) and no further complications were observed .    3.580278875215086
the patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively .    2.667569951601574
about 6 months later , a muscle biopsy was done according to the european mh protocol [ 5 ] and the patient was found to be UNK .    3.904537311829271
in this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered ( table 1 ) .    2.833143618686726
firstly , hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l / min , which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg / kg - min .    4.056851425921625
secondly , we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate ( within 65 - 90 beats / min ) , his UNK and skin were well perfused , his body temperature was 37 °c , and there was no sign of muscle rigidity .    3.4317793722089545
UNK , a defect of the co2 UNK as well as co2 admixture to the n2o and o2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia .    3.3229610488279677
we use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day , and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [ 11 ] .    3.0342248445512294
a postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the o2 / n2o supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus .    2.8152919158718563
a malfunction of both co2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h . UNK performed at the same time using soda lime from the same UNK were totally uneventful .    3.413454704688985
it is concluded that the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis were caused by hypermetabolism .    2.5432812697077405
a thorough postoperative examination by an UNK did not reveal any thyroid , pulmonary , endocrine , or circulatory reason for our intra - and postoperative findings .    3.3161573893368534
iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs , but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h ( table 2 ) .    3.135491486769889
the most suitable explanation in this case is an UNK form of mh .    3.7720965326889178
introduction : avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery ( op UNK = off - pump coronary artery bypass surgery ) for aortocoronary bypass grafting ( UNK ) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery .    3.3398723220543274
with the development of new mechanical stabilization devices , the revascularization of the posterior wall of the heart and the distal UNK coronary artery became feasable .    3.316334282135151
especially high - risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach , because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided .    3.904786269465266
although dementia is described as one of the UNK characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus ( nph ) , UNK gait disturbances and urinary incontinence , there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease .    4.07398356123036
a wide range of UNK relevant symptoms have been described , but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing , apathy , emotional UNK , UNK , memory and attentional impairment .    3.5048905510159383
a number of other functional deficits such as UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK can also frequently be found .    3.5738754206091685
some emphasis is put on the work of j . de UNK ( UNK ) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in nph patients .    3.8478843613741054
the methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low , and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment .    4.0440799219314485
concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in nph , various hypotheses have been formulated , but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly " diffuse " in nature , nor can they be reduced to UNK dysfunctions .    3.206642242656042
recommendations for future research strategies are formulated .    3.516409944130256
up to now there are no published results of therapy of UNK ( UNK , UNK ) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with lhrh - ( UNK hormone - releasing hormone ) agonists in the UNK countries .    3.825149623399053
in this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the lhrh - agonist UNK acetate in a period of 12 months .    3.2084194949801126
the patients showed no tendency of UNK aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection , ejaculation , UNK , sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies .    3.165792067552426
one patient died from suicide .    2.9054961952588085
in combination with other treatments lhrh - agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to UNK acetate and its possible UNK effects .    3.2953309799022326
aim of the study : to investigate the long - term effect of tnfr55 - igg1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous UNK treatments .    3.3549250162298967
methods : between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind , placebo - controlled multicenter trials .    2.9902260916265933
the dose range was 2 . 5 - UNK / month given i . v .    3.43631921085278
all patients were followed - up prospectively for 24 - 36 months after initiation of therapy .    2.997118742487516
the evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count , esr , crp , rf , ana , UNK , and safety parameters at 6 month intervals .    2.9411227568098357
in addition , pharmacokinetics , tnf , and anti - tnfr55 - igg1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection .    3.0728054882676923
results : data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years ; 11 patients are still being treated .    3.3373268595786967
predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol .    3.400873694130958
six patients died ( 1 during treatment , 5 in the post - treatment follow - up ) .    3.979339673511861
all deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post - surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing ( during vacation in another country ) .    2.947382986907883
anti - tnfr55 - igg1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half - time .    3.1742379395977047
shifts in the tnfr55 - igg1 UNK pattern affected pharmacokinetics and efficacy .    3.165435502976903
a lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive ra ( ana and UNK positive already before tnfr55 - igg1 initiation ) .    2.9275014149962804
continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81 % reduction in swollen joint count , less morning stiffness , less pain , and a reduction in steroids .    3.785904067179174
for both UNK and as UNK UNK , visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot .    4.2924508127674015
can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes ?    3.5022129201217016
the valid regulations for medical standards of pilots , as well as the future international regulations such as UNK and UNK , are explained in this respect .    3.803674492367348
a report is given on the work of the advisory board of the german federal government air traffic UNK and on the cases treated so far and their outcome , and recommendations are expressed .    3.353743007070884
concerning the legal situation and clinical experience , advice for pilots , aviation medical examiners and UNK is given .    3.0757054534050705
persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders , especially UNK .    3.341169309200392
inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor , in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency , is responsible for this syndrome .    3.8017089568620586
the etiology , diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed .    2.994212112341577
a complex case of penile - scrotal UNK , hypoplastic prostate gland , testicular UNK and UNK cyst is presented .    3.407074931646953
the official german guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the bundesgesundheitsamt , now called robert - koch - institut , twelve years ago .    2.0601622696187563
the recently published official " guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia " of the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) are categorized according to scientific evidence .    1.8301469542716418
the american guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official german guidelines .    2.029736901968359
the purpose of the present paper is to inform the german anaesthesiologist about the official cdc guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia .    2.424350429653302
at present , the importation into germany of life - threatening and highly UNK diseases such as UNK UNK and UNK is unlikely , but cannot be ruled out .    3.5640423941717465
in spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases , guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation .    3.6988293462991213
in germany , marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy .    3.6002066549682024
a federal framework is missing .    3.111078387226738
a concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter - regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and UNK standardized procedures .    2.9779350422914037
the therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years .    3.2576197768419908
a total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as UNK - centre , long - term open ( 12 months ) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid UNK preparations fumaderm initial and fumaderm .    3.543377596576223
the UNK effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear , with a mean reduction of 76 % in pasi .    3.4843385278762695
adverse events in were noted in 62 % of the patients ( mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints ) .    3.3837041846225766
these were dose - dependent and decreased in frequency in the course of the study .    3.909171344446581
no severe adverse events occurred .    2.9439838026421814
we believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy - resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long - term application .    3.824549417099993
background : because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs , we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment .    3.0917070388019954
the eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions .    3.674814082250101
swelling - often UNK - is a frequent symptom .    4.044707399645908
this publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short UNK of possible causes .    3.415545417272343
the subjective complaints of the patient charts ( pain , pruritus ) are shown to be important criteria for orientation .    4.105599033905502
special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling .    2.8569090037525413
a 74 - year - old man suffered from symptoms of a left upper lobe pneumonia .    3.1287474217051314
additional retrosternal masses were proved .    3.222879901769666
progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy ; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen .    3.978516217131157
no germs could be identified .    3.1622377616031887
bronchoscopy and UNK showed no pathological findings .    3.5630829735960905
his general health became worse , and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of " wandering pneumonia " with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism .    3.5875729032539874
autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland .    2.858811936872815
general manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow .    3.190086416470556
the unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to UNK pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction .    3.0600094123658996
the difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms .    3.2918256587244104
therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of ct , mr , and angiography is very important .    3.906105566011896
definition of the problem : is it the brain that makes a human being a person ?    2.9149554324273113
this anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research , and there are severe ethical consequences UNK : if the appropriate anthropological answer is yes , then all invasive research would be problematic , because one would touch the basis of human essence .    3.4093247808244307
the problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question , UNK and UNK , have opposing concepts .    3.4977058738092546
arguments : this paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as ' res ' - as things .    3.3502950620622807
the explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms .    3.3639790107532805
a third anthropological view that tries to make that UNK is the UNK of the hebrew UNK .    3.812290004568144
it does assume the category ' thing ' while speaking about humans , it UNK the category ' aspect ' .    3.043816910681665
there is no hebrew word for ' mind ' in contrast to ' body ' or vice versa .    2.9099659718441413
the UNK language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect .    2.894522917258781
conclusion : here , the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence , but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality .    3.5557078134515767
introduction : in recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement : hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation .    2.833557971338977
while the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell UNK , the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately .    3.8739585837552557
in the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation .    2.8632718166162183
a 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical UNK blockade of the plexus brachialis ( vip ) .    3.123851423629671
postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia , which resolved completely after treatment .    2.8404521478927154
the blockade of the plexus was performed correctly , failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded .    3.0041042561665527
therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the vip , which might occur despite correct technique , and requires that the patient be informed of this UNK .    3.593736781144846
nevertheless , the vip is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet .    3.200659751806924
the risk of a pneumothorax is about 0 . 2 to 0 . 7 % .    3.790253050649299
the routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine .    3.18399337375182
new trends in perinatal medicine , aiming at more individual and self - determined pregnancy and delivery , are UNK because of the safety provided by ultrasound .    3.455000162048168
often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations , but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy : early detection of fetal viability ; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy ; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy ; later in pregnancy , confirmation of appropriate fetal growth , position and localization of placenta site .    3.170141830561619
in addition , the development of close mother - child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact .    3.0514885246887133
these aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child .    3.173287314557954
for routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children , sonography , voiding cystogram , iv pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available .    3.1233346222958267
furthermore , often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed .    2.8464217088863917
however , the significance of retrograde ureteropyelography in the world literature remains controversial .    2.9517579517179793
therefore , we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department .    2.981305386286458
in 9 children the ureter was visualized by iv pyelogram , voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography ; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the or .    3.1452308657786783
in 11 children the ureter was not visualized preoperatively .    2.5915955420936085
retrograde UNK neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique .    3.4736308724258462
in the children where the ureter was not visualized preoperatively , no ureteric abnormality was found in association with ureteropelvic junction obstruction .    2.996172015992844
hence , we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary , provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation .    3.3684950078055227
we report on a patient with multicentric juvenile UNK , whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis .    2.814396320341943
spontaneous remission of the tumour , which has now been maintained for over 2 years , the change from the primary UNK UNK appearance to a UNK histiocytic picture with multiple fat - UNK giant cells , and the lacking demonstration of specific cell UNK finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed .    4.0054376397165985
in children with horseshoe kidneys wilms ' tumors can be observed 2 to 8 - times more often .    3.3483060419783226
wilms ' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue .    2.9693875435556443
we report about a 28 - month - old girl with an unusual wilms ' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications .    2.90725688736989
the radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross - section UNK .    3.1900230129280875
both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a UNK wilms ' tumor .    4.028353903478371
external gene segments are transferred to cells that UNK growth factors locally to achieve this effect .    3.294183874079831
the influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature .    3.108736065175437
experimental data demonstrate that defect healing in bone can be accelerated by the application of different cytokines in vivo .    3.3801103000288797
gene transfer is a promising , new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade .    3.4441850137001597
biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved .    4.529166715505597
for the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties , a geometrically correct body model has to be established which UNK to complex in vivo conditions .    3.3953284584331676
the aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite - element models ( fem ) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading .    2.854502733239927
explanted human mandibles ( n = 5 ) were investigated by strain UNK to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading .    3.6491510164545646
fem analysis based on a computed tomograph ( ct ) was performed and the results were matched with the test data .    4.213887462496617
our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied .    3.06146519732849
the mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables .    3.657609155948472
at all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile , the minimum principal strain was compressive , and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force .    3.418675441934482
ct - based fem analysis revealed the utility of mathematical models to approximate simulated data our experimental results .    2.886801427848384
hence , fem analysis is a non - invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning .    3.530230169038459
UNK is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis .    3.2400991534190884
70 % of affected patients exhibit mental retardation .    4.133799327671324
inheritance occurs in an autosomal - dominant pattern .    3.680925657608807
the genetic defect is not known .    3.500099998554379
therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non - resectable cancers , the high relative UNK and the high distant metastases rate .    4.482229839263759
even in curatively resected carcinomas , a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the UNK tissue .    3.7318737794058356
the efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent .    3.134394559825195
based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 gy is recommended , resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone .    3.926907504266553
the use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity .    2.762514655583406
in adjuvant and in primary treatment , local tumor UNK was improved ( 70 - 90 % ) .    3.5691683421044416
with palliative intent , pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance .    3.6464297301185264
as a result of the high distant metastases rate , even in curatively resected carcinomas , the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved .    3.1928686911429778
further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( 20 - 30 % ) .    3.3729738377556755
malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body .    3.4353226927028517
they can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types .    4.123256992541352
the way of tumor spread of these malignancies depends on their histologic type and on the region .    3.68848332347736
these compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx , the oropharynx , and the hypopharynx .    3.6849786135754723
most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas , other histologic types are depicted less frequently .    3.235731940192814
the malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments .    3.6172688302166667
beside these tumors , malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated .    3.4744773330742422
while there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip UNK by acetabular component screw fixation , retractor tip pressure or UNK bone cement , the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described .    3.1217268317576536
we report on two patients with per - and UNK femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw ( dhs ) and a dynamic condylar screw ( dcs ) , which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a UNK - size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case .    3.3463652453401114
we UNK these vascular injuries on the pressure of UNK UNK UNK the femoral bone or on the drilling of UNK for plate UNK .    3.9168421371238398
after UNK various operative procedures , we conclude that UNK implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications .    3.423161454463601
cleft lip and UNK ( clp ) are caused by a variety of factors .    4.283536028234862
ionizing radiation is only one of these factors .    4.215759728350218
the UNK of the nuclear reactor at chernobyl on april 26 , 1986 , and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in germany .    3.110894683707662
nevertheless , in west berlin a significant increase of trisomy - 21 cases was reported in births 9 months after the chernobyl reactor accident .    3.0614496862944613
in our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of clp newborns in the former german UNK republic ( gdr ) .    3.0487207442086186
in contrast to the federal republic of germany an ongoing malformation register for clp newborns had existed in the former gdr since 4 july 1967 .    2.4738112767478997
environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy UNK .    3.2330309363087997
population statistics were taken from the statistical UNK of the former gdr .    4.060962802827568
during a 10 - year period from 1980 to 1989 , the average number of clp newborns in the gdr was 1 . 88 per 1 , 000 live births .    3.3931273975342195
a significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983 , 1987 und 1988 .    2.9233246918386206
in comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986 , 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9 . 4 % .    3.5582588051501722
regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of UNK , rostock and UNK , where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the UNK UNK - 137 und strontium - 90 than in other districts .    4.347721408533924
owing to the comprehensive malformation register for clp patients in the gdr , this is the first study for germany , analyzing the clp rate before and after the fallout in chernobyl .    3.15153329153689
the results support the UNK of the influence of radiation - induced increase of clp newborns after the chernobyl reactor accident .    3.700987670752132
the median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5 - 7 months ; it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival .    3.707427210294821
the aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage iv disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease .    2.7755747230296577
in the department of dermatology , UNK UNK university medical centre at the free university of berlin , UNK patients with were diagnosed as having stage iv melanoma and enrolled in a computer - based registry between 1970 and 1993 .    3.184295391690495
in 89 cases systemic medical UNK treatment was given and 111 patients underwent surgery and / or radiation therapy .    3.4018232576200624
there were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy .    3.231517327956472
on the other hand , 111 patients received no treatment .    2.4454470008454576
twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months ( median survival time 33 months ) .    3.753320626939655
none of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer .    3.559415185386505
the 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and / or radiation , while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3 , only local treatment .    3.569953141494782
twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation .    3.064606306775601
active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients .    3.433132526350876
a significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported .    2.9963098316057444
this time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period .    3.4924577087464788
it has therefore been recommended to gradually UNK heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly .    2.8016356124674497
the use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human UNK is discussed with reference to the literature .    3.592898410110961
the epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural , functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers .    3.303943525757242
the actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed .    2.7505339916865754
practical difficulties are emphasized : in particular , the conditions required for use of porcine skin in experimental research , the most suitable UNK , and restrictions on biological interpretation of the results .    3.7161057934162303
laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years ( table 1 ) [ 34 ] .    3.8232684941798767
laparoscopic pelvic and para - aortal UNK are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging .    3.2372112240814297
in the case of primarily operable tumours , paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure , and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra - abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy .    3.2703967007824075
if laparoscopy UNK positive lymph nodes , debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy .    3.6977099586799076
in addition , laparoscopic procedures , even in combination with radical UNK for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix , can mean conservation of the patient ' s fertility .    3.6043357425789067
in the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra - abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient ' s condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable .    3.290970319406602
in addition , in the case of primarily UNK patients whose carcinoma of the cervix has been diagnosed incidentally in preparations of tissue examined following hysterectomy , UNK in the form of laparoscopic lymphadenectomy and laparoscopically assisted UNK can be performed .    3.387435567811234
the efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients ( n = 20 ) was compared to methadone maintained subjects ( n = 20 ) in a randomized comparison trial .    3.415205620697331
a trend ( p = 0 . 06 ) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone ( UNK of l - and d - methadone ) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7 , 3 mg buprenorphine ( sublingual tablets ) .    3.334013023603482
the dropout - rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout - rate of 5 in the methadone group .    3.343103676055924
there was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates , benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology .    2.4825388812680385
the result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid ( p = 0 , 04 ) .    3.5897930393664446
nevertheless , efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects , and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed .    3.5384293872197405
in patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma , surgery is a technically difficult procedure .    3.1975048253431795
whereas those rare forms of localized pleural UNK are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection , most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease .    3.2980897008566563
most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality .    3.6559797088151367
for diffuse pleural mesothelioma , some favorable prognostic factors were identified : imig ( international mesothelioma interest group ) , stages i and ii , epithelial type , age under 50 , female gender .    2.972012813263093
in imig stages i and ii , extended UNK followed by chemo - and / or radiotherapy is recommended .    3.500987859083279
for this UNK of patients , a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported .    3.9489330278731996
in patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall , irradiation is helpful ; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy .    3.2848519733264907
fetal UNK ( fmcg ) UNK the magnetic field generated by the fetal heart .    3.354849668965411
in contrast to the fetal UNK , UNK permits non - invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the UNK - wave - forms from the second UNK onwards .    3.997586955593079
this facilitates the determination of cardiac time intervals and establishment of reference values for different stages of pregnancy .    3.296597129177279
we examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards ( 1 to 10 recordings per individual ) .    2.7401918567257937
the fmcg ( 37 magnetic channels , sampling rate UNK hz , UNK 1 - UNK ) was recorded non - invasively over the mother ' s abdomen in a UNK shielded room .    3.4881275775433807
registration of fetal heart beats was generally successful from the 20 / UNK week of gestation onwards .    3.030514098927472
in a few cases , fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the UNK week .    3.692241123010159
cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fmcg increased UNK with fetal growth .    2.904363915145407
mean p wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms ( p < 0 . 05 ) , UNK interval from 95 to 107 ms ( n . s . ) and qrs duration from 36 to 52 ms ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.7186641179017785
the mean amplitudes of the p and r waves also increased .    2.8985570457972947
to demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications .    3.644825144903985
the purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint .    3.0405340363717865
in all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients ( 79 , 3 % ) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results .    3.835277575440527
all in all we have found complications in 14 patients .    3.1743227432001153
in 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing , in 2 cases a superficial infection , in 3 cases a deep infection , in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a UNK .    3.273779678305704
our study show , that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy , exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the UNK .    3.837383506444756
the use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate .    3.190578796039395
airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise .    3.965943614514322
we report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation .    2.669196552142339
the 24 - year - old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000 - to UNK - hz range and in the deep - frequency .    3.7543385029960112
the possibility of acoustic trauma from airbag noise are probably much more common and need more attention in the clinic .    3.1503176147770753
the incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura , the pericardium and the peritoneum in germany has been rising since about the mid - 1980 s . a continuing rise is expected until about UNK , predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in germany between 1965 and 1980 .    3.1168107375986143
about 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the german mesothelioma registry in bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations .    3.38132297851197
more than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the german mesothelioma registry .    3.537643697477467
in this first part of the series on mesotheliomas , current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed .    3.8192760855193955
at the present , specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known .    3.012210168796214
the initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations .    3.5848219157661623
a reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic , prognostic and medicolegal UNK ; in general , it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy .    3.805602905245248
surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of UNK membranes not only in palliative , but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages .    3.9331693538245904
acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10 % .    3.7330617024392025
upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent ( 85 % ) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding .    3.6886213435052695
the medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source .    3.7162621112872882
prognosis and mortality are dependent on intensity of bleeding , reflected by clinical signs such as shock , hemoglobin level , transfused blood units , UNK , presence of comorbidity and age of the patient .    3.5970617334796016
furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality .    3.479069199511302
therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding .    4.048295348907292
joints are innervated by nociceptive nerve fibres ( nociceptors ) , which are only activated by tissue - damaging stimuli .    3.483781553512601
this activation causes pain in conscious humans .    3.069422122524895
the sensory UNK of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes .    3.314565485790166
under these conditions , normally UNK and non - painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain .    3.0098039380609305
the effect of inflammatory mediators such as bradykinin and prostaglandins is important for the process of sensitization .    3.401333098491057
in addition to their sensory function , many nociceptors have an efferent function .    2.759821818300262
they UNK a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance p and calcitonin gene - related peptide into the tissue .    2.880092706617468
the efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue .    3.5388361120024134
aaa bone possesses osteoinductive properties as it delivers bmps from its bone matrix .    3.0530494600692957
within a prospective study , 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using aaa bone implants over a period of more than 7 years .    3.3809706739091654
the patients were followed - up at standardized intervals .    2.883717219959345
in one quarter of the cases re - entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty ( removal of osteosynthesis material , recurrence of tumor ) .    3.312547488126216
all nine aaa bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony UNK .    2.896869750709162
a bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these aaa bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant .    3.7994799316823835
in one case an aaa bone implant was lost due to infection .    2.7743728483504695
this is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus .    3.7002384886146866
the clinical results clearly emphasize the therapeutical benefit of aaa bone for UNK .    2.8317180172574186
large aaa bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull ' s UNK , especially when UNK - based operation planning is performed .    3.6456255406370603
saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting .    3.37371682910823
in an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure , minimally invasive video - assisted vein harvesting is UNK .    3.6735346668460864
the technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions .    2.7585582265201376
the dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips .    2.8729841785397117
the vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure .    3.2439860056508847
initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein - preparation time of 60 min .    3.053090509515129
two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision .    2.816888528077201
after a mean follow - up of 12 months , all bypasses are patent .    3.1699213367424743
taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration , aspects of cost - effectiveness are discussed .    3.9550245181080363
obstructions of the UNK duct occur frequently ( 70 % ) in term newborns and are symptomatic in 6 % .    4.451335602514227
the reason is an incomplete UNK and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period .    3.4532744327586276
a persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of UNK in combination with a proximal UNK obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation .    3.390633912628784
we describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress .    2.8704890919276367
the recognition of a medical discipline on a european level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the european union .    3.325772244578531
with supreme effort , the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the eu reached this goal in 1989 .    3.216011575135151
the UNK - section of UNK and UNK surgery - became the UNK for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and UNK of the european commission .    4.483004338480755
thanks to its activities , oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about 3800 specialists in 11 european countries .    2.8600345480958818
a biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68 - year - old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick - sinus - syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay .    3.114467140932263
the electrode in the right atrium was connected to the atrial channel , the electrode in the coronary sinus to the ventricular channel .    3.353894001377378
the pacemaker was programmed in ddd - mode with an av - delay of 30 ms .    3.2224568817709303
under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient ' s history , 24 - h - holter - ecg , nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow - up of 8 months .    3.3582117849731628
the ab0 blood types , first discovered by karl UNK in UNK , can be UNK with the pcr method of lee and chang [ 6 ] .    3.380122610858151
using two UNK pairs , allele - specific sequences can be amplified and , after digestion with restriction UNK , visualized by silver staining on a UNK gel .    2.976449234344103
in a UNK german population the allele frequencies were : allele a = 0 . UNK , allele b = 0 . UNK and allele 0 = 0 . UNK .    3.48585205505014
with the method of lee and chang [ 6 ] only the nucleotide positions 261 and UNK are considered so that out of 280 individuals 10 ( 3 . 57 % ) showed differences between the ab0 genotype and phenotype , because it was not possible to differentiate between a and 02 alleles .    3.2070576392639953
based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given , surgical equipment , patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described .    3.6622956792192674
finally the results and possible complications are presented .    3.793168076285703
removal of loose bodies as well as UNK in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication .    3.9106766545490834
cartilage treatment is technically possible , however , long term results are still missing .    3.9761525342598536
this is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans .    3.7673503550439857
in patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit .    3.2412697574389524
arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses ( aaa ) is technically demanding , but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques .    3.3097759218031655
the complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints , which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections .    3.302732206420102
this should be addressed when performing the informed consent .    2.67181148157817
recent prospective randomised trials UNK with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic , rectal and breast cancer .    3.602006577693278
in pancreatic cancer extended lymphadenectomy did not improve overall survival .    3.20700687997692
total UNK excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer .    2.990321576442177
rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation .    3.3019645382252794
in advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy .    2.7167840517808455
it has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases UNK resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival .    3.382860137400956
up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy .    3.164163352468347
following neoadjuvant chemotherapy UNK rate is significantly higher , but survival is not significantly increased .    3.420394921665377
introduction and methods : a 0 . 5 t open - configuration mr system allows free access to the patient via a 58 - cm - wide opening on both sides of the machine .    3.745221725742571
a newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real - time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body .    3.2772859186368555
the acquired images are displayed on two UNK screens localized within the mr system , thus allowing an interactive needle guidance .    3.150338249012098
this procedure is illustrated by a case report .    3.157997198322093
angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension .    3.5633977604053437
there is UNK evidence to suggest that ace inhibitors may be used for different indications as well .    3.226522291575953
the rational for the use of ace inhibitors is to block the UNK effects mediated by angiotensin ii .    3.4244008052257793
the hemodynamic profile of ace inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the UNK of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide ( no ) .    3.01864464101872
thus ace inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation .    3.076993136197083
the critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) is still a major therapeutic challenge .    3.259200364203014
intravenous preparations of ace inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients .    3.094996866813094
however , several questions about the exact mechanisms of ace inhibitors , such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose , are still open .    3.6211030897099916
moreover , further work needs to be done to definitely determine whether ace inhibitors may be helpful to prevent or treat ( micro - ) circulatory catastrophe in these patients .    3.024742469905103
the pharmacologic properties of ace inhibitors provide an UNK UNK stone for future research in this field .    3.4056776330129024
hypoparathyroidism ( hp ) results from deficient parathyroid hormone ( pth ) secretion , UNK ( UNK ) results form decreased pth action on its target organs .    3.2326708035069056
between may 1996 and 1999 , a total of 186 endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures .    3.3584159087017107
the operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body , partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest , and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused .    3.231651307433952
in 62 % of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur UNK .    3.659936508106975
the serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant , each of which occurred in 1 case .    3.68020604966869
comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery , while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically , with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence .    3.951230455736172
various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery .    3.8452177019354665
although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations , its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned .    3.5271666662321906
it was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients .    3.250697470963271
between september 1998 and february 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores : initial UNK , UNK clinic , french , euro , pons , and the ontario province risk score .    3.6930101324397073
early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively .    3.2107803464445674
follow - up was completed in UNK patients .    3.200810280548067
with the exception of the ontario province risk score , lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores , whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores .    2.767534582390232
mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations .    3.3418971436627087
preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome .    3.486424761924805
with the aid of risk scores , operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations .    3.164742541345647
the euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients .    3.688647482426057
however , when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient , risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process .    4.105396401615921
background and objective : a complicated course of erysipelas is not uncommon .    2.830263656176134
bullous , haemorrhagic , necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered .    2.7786179070503016
today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors , particularly diabetes mellitus , are often suggested .    3.1783469663919566
based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the department of dermatology in UNK , factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified .    4.101410098968574
patients / methods : in a retrospective case - control study clinical data UNK of UNK in - patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors .    4.550676747656703
results : general risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities , pre - existing hepatic or renal disease , hyperuricaemia , and diabetes mellitus .    3.3047293955218726
hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions , while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for UNK - UNK lesions .    3.4153281779791507
conclusions : location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors , while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested .    3.4825543536838497
patients with end - stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia .    3.1183575046170873
the onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors , since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients .    3.0281035930779
this substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0 . 5 - 1 iu of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1 % .    3.2214178258136292
we set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end - stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation .    3.275078572166161
fifty - one adult patients were prospectively studied .    3.267783467864777
in 37 patients with antithrombin iii ( at iii ) activity < 70 % , an at iii preparation ( UNK , behring , marburg , germany ) was given preoperatively ( mean dose UNK + / - 207 iu ) following standard calculations in order to increase endogenous activity to 80 % .    3.203931567168964
twenty - seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure ( chf group ) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure ( UNK group ) .    3.3035781821175823
blood samples were drawn prior to a 15 - min infusion of at iii concentrate and 30 min thereafter .    3.1323740102405417
in 14 patients with prothrombin time ( pt ) < 40 % , at iii levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities > 70 % .    3.0047577899826217
prothrombin complex ( ppsb , UNK , behring , marburg , germany ) was substituted ( mean dose UNK + / - 289 iu ) to increase procoagulant activity to pt > 60 % .    3.1796592836969264
the amounts of at iii and ppsb concentrates ( at iii , [ iu / kg ] ; ppsb [ iu / kg ] ) required to increase at iii activity and pt , respectively , by 1 % were calculated .    3.2026652901311348
standard calculations for at iii substitution indicated at iii recovery in all 37 patients who received at iii concentrate .    3.3272916831557358
however , there was a statistically significant difference between patients with clf and alf .    3.025956138819195
in patients with clf , at iii was found to be 0 . 8 iu / kg ( + / - 0 . 1 sem ) and in those with alf it was 1 . 5 iu / kg ( + / - 0 . 1 sem ) ( p < 0 . 05 , t - test ) .    3.3834499801674704
in patients treated with ppsb concentrate , ppsb was 1 . 6 u / kg ( + / - 0 . 2 sem ) for both clf and alf groups .    3.4339947760743046
in patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with at iii - concentrate are adequate only for patients with clf .    3.2159673839514564
in patients with alf higher at iii doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous at iii activity .    3.2449391394994116
procoagulant activity , as reflected by pt , can be increased by 1 % when 1 . 6 iu / kg ppsb concentrate is given .    3.527067900324576
however , this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only 30 min after administration .    3.716415414930959
an increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of at iii activity in the alf group , indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient ' s clinical symptoms and diagnosis .    3.4670625119956955
fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis .    4.626372271096717
rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients .    2.7855674792917333
regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a certain degree .    3.453264055937269
a sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time .    3.0864096716181066
both occasions were associated with menstruation .    3.529509942607111
UNK UNK was isolated in the tracheal secretions once .    3.48592152810647
discussion : the etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described .    3.0796601789836617
the toxic shock syndrome toxin - 1 acts as a UNK in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .    3.4120274932172747
this case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar UNK process .    2.999277075229575
UNK of mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization , whose pathogenesis is not fully understood .    3.326490935415624
the common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border .    2.689162175386697
the histopathologic hallmark is a UNK UNK UNK .    4.2938519319709565
an unusual case of porokeratosis UNK , a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of mibelli , is reported .    3.1662472785285405
the pathogenesis , taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis , is discussed .    2.7282279003669507
we report two cases with high - dose usage and dependency of non - benzodiazepine hypnotics .    2.958821167502472
both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode .    2.826908862864761
while one patient had a UNK abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient .    3.690426896000829
to reduce withdrawal symptoms long - acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients .    3.096368660019667
considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non - benzodiazepine hypnotics .    2.778820845668596
fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro - and supination .    3.8287250323932724
however , traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself , but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction , manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy .    3.490306752580721
in a prospective long - term follow - study ( 2 - 20 years after trauma ) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only .    3.3990481594957407
these were not caused by radial head deformities , which were present on 83 % of follow - up radiographs .    3.6145324611288854
functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances .    3.329432262816886
on follow - up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture UNK up to 60 ° had corrected themselves spontaneously .    3.247091018388799
in view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results , as well as the UNK for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects , we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children .    3.8968127995840294
patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked UNK in spite of a highly positive fluid balance .    3.1139766499071393
this is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift .    3.323319194874338
further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure .    2.9947768081374493
the present study was designed to investigate whether this fluid overload could be avoided by using a hypertonic - UNK solution ( group i : UNK , 10 % hydroxyethylstarch 200 / 0 . 5 in 7 . 2 % saline ) instead of two different standard colloid solutions ( group ii : ha , 5 % albumin ; group iii : UNK , 6 % hydroxyethylstarch in 0 . 9 % saline ) .    3.95434510619321
purpose : the temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide ( no ) .    2.6374080838684826
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) .    2.7156697864273074
methods : articular chondrocytes were harvested from rabbit cartilage slices and cultured in UNK medium supplemented with 10 % fetal calf serum .    2.7221034518686467
subsequently , cells ( 105 / ml per well ) were transferred to UNK plates , grown to 90 % UNK , and subjected to one of the following regimens : ( 1 ) no mechanical strain ( 10 hz , 20 % elongation rate ) ; ( 2 ) rhil - 1 ( 1 ng / ml ) ; ( 3 ) mechanical strain ; ( 4 ) mechanical strain and rhil - 1 .    3.8281692078249145
the cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h . thereafter , cells were UNK and UNK on microscope slides in a UNK UNK .    3.702406752823764
the presence of inos was determined by indirect UNK staining using polyclonal rabbit anti - inos as primary antibodies , and UNK anti - rabbit igg conjugated with UNK peroxidase ( hrp ) as secondary antibodies .    3.07813524143662
UNK was used as substrate for hrp .    3.4009242052615853
total no production was UNK measured in the supernatants of cultures using UNK reaction .    3.1633312496351933
all experiments were done in UNK and the statistical significance was analyzed by student ' s t - test .    3.6155081057258123
results : cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of inos .    3.170274674364096
il - 1 - treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining .    4.02069763053525
cells in group 4 exposed to il - 1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity .    3.190467597333299
control cells treated with normal rabbit igg as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining .    3.2210716281007175
the data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of no levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups .    2.994363554534868
conclusion : our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti - inflammatory effects on chondrocytes , UNK the quantity of inos - positive cells .    2.9788062557136095
since no acts as an intracellular , UNK , and cytotoxic molecule , it has a basic importance for proper post - traumatic and postoperative tmj function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory tmj diseases .    4.071914966149983
recently , we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer .    2.8338512936479785
its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss .    3.4344154050045406
the transducer UNK micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ .    2.8473876410505894
efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears .    4.01395555908788
after determining preoperative ( acoustical ) bera threshold , the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph .    3.011419719798811
bera responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo , long incus process , stapes head , stapes foot plate , and UNK .    2.9981608093448537
by comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold , a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation .    3.0348184485210727
an electrical transducer voltage of 1 UNK * was equivalent to sound - pressure levels between 100 and 128 db spl at the tympanic membrane .    2.7229221282847544
to judge hearing impression , stimulus - dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials ( waves p1 to UNK ) and their thresholds were analyzed .    3.4421652963764116
after coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process , latencies corresponded well to stimulation .    3.065794216070987
they were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound - pressure level of 100 db spl was achieved by the transducer voltage level .    2.9397640086762515
pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by UNK , UNK and o ' UNK .    3.991343801554398
nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology , published by marie - UNK devergie in the first half of the UNK century , which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum .    3.6114889104935
in addition to discussions of typical UNK UNK of the skin , devergie ' s " UNK de la UNK UNK " includes illustrations of UNK ulcers , which appeared unexpectedly after local and systemic therapy with mercury .    3.274109280113365
devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy .    3.3643938632970714
thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930 .    3.412413148475197
the etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled .    3.105825761021481
the favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s .    3.4818985796023925
multiple - system atrophy ( msa ) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar , pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs .    3.053699690717297
in msa patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies .    2.7786199922967056
however , assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed .    2.8769539037709673
we report our clinical experience in managing a 56 - year - old , obese male msa patient ( 1 . 76 m height , 100 kg weight , bmi 32 . 3 kg / m2 ) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness .    3.2512766325443545
endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy .    3.1484556481143855
polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals ( 11 . 1 / h ) and an UNK of 1 . 4 / h .    4.14028131600563
sleep efficiency was low ( 51 . 9 % ) due to long intermittent awake periods .    3.5664588957064556
sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during rem and non - rem sleep .    3.4941359553334297
during inspiration UNK movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring .    3.3283994881667094
this was regularly terminated by arousals .    2.8837659257817463
the further treatment is discussed .    3.2115356345941133
in general , glottic snoring without daytime UNK is rare and has only been described in msa patients .    3.248444270453173
however , certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal UNK .    3.8493217865121134
the source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy .    3.370965797899254
it is assumed that they possess anti - infective properties .    2.5366423214605773
homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement .    3.508334408240859
we present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis .    2.8518361393692553
the surgical management of enlarged inferior UNK has been actively debated for more than a century .    2.8436841151266443
the second part of this review UNK the following techniques : UNK , submucous turbinectomy , UNK - UNK , partial turbinectomy , anterior turbinectomy , inferior UNK , total turbinectomy , and vidian neurectomy .    3.4043067346155262
indications , advantages , disadvantages , complications , and controversies of each treatment UNK are reviewed and discussed .    3.4135368612701895
partial or submucosal resection should be prefered , because there are moderate side effects and the amount of UNK excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology .    3.3926521005836716
total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed .    2.9188112385244667
acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities .    3.438932157733482
acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning ; in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of UNK , a vasodilator .    3.6070006017490144
furthermore , chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate .    2.8258285373215672
acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure ; in addition oxalate - induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue .    3.281776708853741
the diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues .    2.9287313953384073
in terms of therapy , hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function .    3.8350247703965517
in cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful .    2.9326248112501787
generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions .    3.1973593471577364
in contrast to localized granuloma annulare , generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients , shows a stronger association with diabetes , and is characteristically chronic .    3.171672215548284
like our 55 - year - old patient , most patients present with papules and annular plaques ; less often , macular or non - annular lesions may be encountered .    3.0615337039758947
histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a UNK granuloma .    3.1634359272114714
instead , there are diffuse dermal , band - like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery .    2.945045008777335
because of its special characteristics , it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis .    3.2172519483145083
using immunohistochemistry to determine the UNK phenotype of the lesional histiocytes , we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis .    3.737013484945645
neither ms - 1 high - molecular - weight protein , a new specific marker for cutaneous non - langerhans cell histiocytoses , nor UNK , the well - known marker for langerhans cells and langerhans cell histiocytoses , is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient .    3.0840217237487573
in contrast , the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non - infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare .    2.8910062857674537
in contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon - 1 , systemic treatment with interferon - 2b ( UNK units three times a week ) was ineffective .    3.2116847711531653
the aims of the study were : ( 1 ) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade ; and ( 2 ) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade , i . e . , the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time ( time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train - of - four [ tof ] ratio 0 . 70 ) , and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to tof ratio 0 . 70 .    3.1635821610112593
post - UNK count ( ptc ) of tof stimulation of the ulnar nerve and UNK were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission .    3.721741108116167
the neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0 . 6 mg / kg and supplemental doses of 0 . 15 mg / kg were given when the first twitch response in the tof ( th1 ) had recovered to 20 % .    3.6363370103667556
neostigmine 0 . 036 mg / kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients .    3.530448627852584
multiple regression analyses including pre - reversal time ( time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration ) , ptc , weight , and age of the patients suggest that pre - reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time : reversal time = 27 . 3 min - ( 0 . 89xpre - reversal time [ min ] ; ( see = 6 . 0 min ) .    2.9598166483910977
if pre - reversal time is unknown , ptc can be used : reversal time = 24 min - ( 4 . UNK ptc ) at time of reversal ) ; ( see = 6 . 8 min ) .    3.574179461684815
total recovery time was 47 min ( sem = 2 . 0 min , n = 15 ) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously , and 29 min ( sem = 1 . 2 min , n = 29 ) in the patients reversed by neostigmine ; the difference of 18 min ( se UNK 2 . 0 min ) was significant ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    3.74359598711681
the level of blockade indicated by ptc ( 1 - 24 ) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time .    3.9150962560182823
the spontaneous recovery times from UNK of th1 and th1 = 10 % to tof ratio 0 . 70 were 29 . 2 min ( sem = 1 . 7 min ) and 24 . 4 min ( sem = 2 . 6 min ) , respectively .    3.229773272926632
the results suggest that pre - reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade .    2.501459072008184
to achieve the optimal time - saving effect , neostigmine must be given 18 min ( the time saved by giving neostigmine ) plus 7 to 11 min ( needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect ) , giving a total of 25 to 29 min before tof ratio 0 . 70 .    2.864579008510223
as th1 is between 1 % and 10 % 25 to 29 min before tof ratio 0 . 70 is reached during spontaneous recovery , the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when th1 is between 1 % and 10 % .    2.472694339639973
reversal time can be predicted as 27 . 3 min - ( 0 . 89xpre - reversal time ( min ) , and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when th1 is 1 % - 10 % .    3.42669710356496
a seminar for hospital physicians in management positions ( UNK UNK - und UNK , UNK ) in october 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of w . r . bion ' s book experiences in groups and other papers , published in 1961 .    3.40917471752184
the aim of this article , UNK bion ' s experiences in groups by presenting in seminar ' s leadership principles , is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual .    3.2189884219411753
if continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic - clonic seizures require prompt treatment , if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided .    2.9063230571732332
the mortality varies ( mean : 20 % ) depending on patient age and etiology .    3.448603999679894
control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80 % of cases : UNK is recommended due to its longer - acting effects on the central nervous system .    3.800636113646408
to maintain the UNK effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously .    3.3405281551813535
the iv use of UNK acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising , but needs further evaluation .    3.7606075218445243
there is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes ( i . e . , refractory status epilepticus ) .    3.029908428561267
since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities UNK the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment .    3.129730128037338
the goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology .    3.136555102693301
new arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further .    2.9527494416905973
in cases of UNK tears with cuff - tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered .    2.710990786146585
based on clinical , radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion .    3.6262924120237203
almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) experience symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation during the course of the illness .    2.796159340779435
these symptoms can develop years before death and may severely affect quality of life .    2.8984773876170915
non - invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation ( hmv ) via mask is a possible palliative measure for these symptoms , which is not often used in germany .    3.554091694369082
we report on our experience with hmv in 24 patients with als .    2.946148724502399
our data show a good palliative effect in 17 of 24 treated patients .    3.293752222221806
severe complications did not occur .    2.5487753099718624
the mean ventilation time at present is 14 months .    3.052553396755431
available options and their consequences need to be discussed in detail with patients and relatives before hmv is initiated .    3.665283075614826
many clinical studies have been performed investigating corneal endothelial cell loss after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods .    3.1982433650595476
most studies , however , included variable follow - up intervals , UNK the dynamic cell loss over the course of time .    4.461829819521583
the aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods .    2.6309128755225872
primary sclerosing UNK ( psc ) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) .    3.0874838908133317
the disease typically progresses slowly , but ultimately , and leads to cirrhosis , liver failure or bile duct cancer .    2.863979159136977
psc patients with simultanous ulcerative colitis are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer .    2.8488680615593007
at the present time , there is no effective treatment for psc , although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with UNK acid .    3.207469752916655
however , there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug , because follow - up time is not yet long enough .    3.6399308806987767
isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically .    3.6941015654948814
the possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of psc is controversial .    3.2663475982366488
liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for psc in its final stage .    3.4304949337605373
the 5 - year survival rate ( 89 % ) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications .    3.099570667990167
patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy .    3.511517323445279
although the course of uc after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic , these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer .    3.16815072063857
on 3 june 1998 a high - speed train ( inter city express , ice ) UNK with a bridge at a speed of 200 km / h .    3.2011455873098535
the bridge collapsed and the rear UNK of the train were UNK into it with the power of the rear UNK .    3.618418259015051
the accident caused 101 deaths and 103 injuries .    3.0379680065137533
four minutes after the accident the alarm was raised , and 16 minutes after the accident the first doctor was on the scene , arriving from UNK , approx .    3.073649659158745
severe complications after UNK treatments rarely occur .    3.036854874328663
they happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the UNK articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and UNK .    3.126101074025229
therefore , x - ray pictures from the part of the vertebral region to be treated are inevitable and likewise the medical scientific associations demand them uniformly to minimize the risks .    3.70714955754489
in patients with painful , possibly hemorrhagic vesicles or black crusts , especially on hands / fingers or face / neck with typical history ( contact to cows or UNK / cats ) the possibility of a cowpox / catpox infection has to be considered .    2.615891532811002
the clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy ; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically .    2.897853136480495
further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox / catpox virus by pcr or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies .    3.418900363506279
we report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox / catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats .    3.318145323175886
recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also discussed .    3.4332389965925514
the laboratory findings of hemolysis , elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation .    3.3049456871950884
a high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed .    2.9965913300903626
the high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade .    3.272175938499741
however , the fact that hellp syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post - partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question , in particular , since there is a high rate of UNK complications after cesarean section in acute hellp syndrome .    3.3064241041289035
because of the correlation of complications of hellp syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia , the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features .    3.7834673665302074
the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in hellp syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept .    2.5221915783942648
innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects .    3.870603680893017
in particular , besides the external UNK nucleus , thick - calibre neck muscle afferents project directly , to the vestibular nuclear complex .    2.9043938012127213
this projection is most prominent in segments c2 and 3 and is sparse or absent in more caudal segments .    3.0679559988299925
thus , proprioceptive neck muscle afferents gain direct access to UNK , UNK and other secondary or even higher order vestibular neurons that receive labyrinthine input .    3.1979940544530687
proprioceptive input via indirect UNK pathways is also most prominent from c2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels .    3.082676074308529
likewise , thin calibre , mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are UNK via the UNK nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents .    2.836446587552115
it is tempting to consider these UNK peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the UNK symptoms after whiplash injury .    3.8383107669744283
in some recent german textbooks of pain management there is maintained that psychological dependence to opioids in pain patients is not a real problem .    3.082409901260643
the evidence for this statement is reviewed .    3.210240588295966
real bone tumors are rarely encountered in the daily routine of radiological practice .    3.3267206387074677
therefore , for a general radiologist there is no need for a specialist knowledge on this field .    4.0579204713821975
however , he should be able to distinguish benign from malignant lesions in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies .    3.425756846864152
a systematic approach towards osteolytic lesions , e . g . according to the classification of UNK , is mandatory .    3.804461244362221
ct and mri are indicated to clear up the anatomy in areas of superposition UNK in conventional radiology and to determine the inner structure of a lesion , e . g . fatty tissue , liquid / solid .    3.3403998804744046
guidelines for the management of bony lesions will be given in detail .    4.212941395334667
the option and necessity for a specialist second opinion is emphasized .    3.2004048065852646
during routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients .    2.8928174934674846
pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range ( 250 hz - 8 khz ) and perception of music were the basis of UNK evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study .    3.5646291728338086
the piezoelectric transducer reached an equivalent transducer sound - pressure level of up to 145 db spl and frequencies of 10 khz .    3.018003616346531
the low nonlinear distortions of around 0 . 1 % and the frequency range up to 10 khz are reflected in the positive evaluation of sound quality by 84 % of the patients involved .    3.452583033050369
the study is the basis for realizing a piezoelectric transducer designed for routine clinical implantations .    3.4341507741379074
the transducer is thought to be part of a totally implantable future hearing aid for rehabilitation of moderate and severe sensory neural hearing loss predominantly in the middle and high frequency range .    3.1760015288731585
background : baker et al .    2.6752587037050413
used a co2 laser for UNK for the first time .    3.9148031306767415
the UNK co2 laser provides a sophisticated instrument that makes more application alternatives possible in ophthalmology .    2.8231167797606145
several investigations prove that monaural acoustic deprivation induces detrimental changes in the auditory pathway .    2.9935830746632
this UNK study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response ( abr ) in the mongolian UNK .    3.4135385428170366
young UNK were UNK by a single UNK application of UNK sulfate .    4.676358485834715
the abr development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals .    3.139571228815348
these changes persisted until adulthood .    2.870122720776695
between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 db decrease of the abr thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency ii - v occured .    3.1886524613547915
the results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem .    2.8954008037364938
there are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by UNK , 80 - 90 % of whom live in UNK areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce .    3.217303289333512
the majority of all cataract operations are still UNK extractions ( UNK ) .    3.084588252520042
UNK correction using UNK is UNK in developing countries .    3.9808958615394956
dorsal fusion with the internal fixator has become the standard treatment of instabilities and deformities of the thoracolumbar spine .    3.248054312414939
with our new device , the modular spine fixator ( msf ) , which has been specially designed for short - distance instrumentations , we have increasingly been treating unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine by one - level stabilization .    3.3240662922338178
prerequisite is an accurate evaluation of the indication , including ct and mri to assess the involvement of the intervertebral disc and the UNK structures .    5.118874293232679
the operative technique differs in some details from the procedure in UNK - level instrumentations , especially concerning the application of the pedicle screws .    3.3423515527272807
the instrumentation is always combined with posterior allogenic bone grafting .    3.096113428172351
since the beginning of 1993 we also perform anterior autogenic transpedicular bone grafting .    2.8096043441193146
between UNK 1991 and july 1995 , 57 one - level UNK with the msf were performed .    3.3969879191111363
of the 57 patients operated on 39 , 27 men and 12 women , with an average age of 41 years , have had a clinical and radiographic follow - up examination so far , on average , 27 months after the accident .    3.747556866394065
seventeen patients were completely free of pain and 17 patients ( were only ) UNK to weather changes or had minor pain during great physical stress .    3.123653860430007
five patients had pain even during slight physical stress or at rest .    3.0392828814418387
the preoperatively measured cobb angle was 15 . 1 ° on average , after the operation 5 . 2 ° , and at the time of the follow - up examination amounted to 8 . 1 ° .    4.217460458442147
the patients ' range of motion was normal .    3.3175134188929936
only five minor complications have been seen .    3.594906806477463
no implant fatigue failure has been noted in this series .    3.2703917453597184
we derive from these results that , for correct indications , one - level stabilization can be performed successfully and should be firmly established in the operative treatment of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine .    3.7509132870542543
between may 1995 and march 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients .    3.693589971375985
ages of the patients were 9 , 36 and 74 years .    4.235545252421695
all patients suffered from a frequent epistaxis and all were extremely sensitive to the slightest nasal touch .    3.093834449358507
one patient reported breathing difficulties due to nasal congestion .    2.839149384158156
examination revealed a tumor that filled the entire nasal cavity .    3.4941267385154156
the method of choice in treatment of these tumors is surgical removal .    3.7093425439603704
UNK , non - chromaffin paraganglioma , UNK , cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques .    3.710587210692223
from a clinical perspective the bleeding septal UNK ( granuloma UNK sive pyogenicum sive UNK ) has to be considered because it often comes from UNK ' s plexus , has a mushroom - like appearance and bleeds slightly .    3.235626497727786
background : gynaecological surgery including laparoscopy is frequently associated with ponv .    2.8455767837170756
therefore , choosing an anaesthetic with only little side effects in operations UNK for outpatient surgery is at least as important as applying anaesthetics that enable fast - tracking .    3.1202378540645093
the reliability of continuous UNK oximetry in cerebral venous blood and its correlation with intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures ( pressure - volume curve ) were examined in an experimental porcine study .    3.2654956515194447
in a population - based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age ( mean age 64 . 5 + / - 7 . 9 years ) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales .    3.330849435276354
posturographic data of double - stance with eyes open and eyes closed ( dseo ; dsec ) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function .    2.988891845667742
the total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well - known UNK score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures .    3.1295565786672266
dsec correlated with the items " rapid walking " and " single - stance left leg " .    3.158690701073774
age , vision , and neuropsychologic test results correlated with dseo , " rapid walking " , " single - stance right leg " , " single - stance left leg " , and " walking a figure eight " .    2.681439165837231
multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age , vision , dseo , and dsec on " rapid walking " with a 34 % variance explanation .    3.117713944198372
posturographic parameters did predict other selected gait and balance items .    3.0729521422240618
when used in older women living independently in the community , parameters of static posturography reflect to some extent the functional disabilities of gait and balance .    2.934662748697391
the ocular surface epithelia with the tear film as a unit provide clear vision and comfort and serve as the first line of defense .    2.9246483308619706
it is important to understand how ocular surface health is maintained and how ocular surface failure occurs .    2.7452199738887586
furthermore , it is timely to summarize new information concerning action mechanisms and clinical uses of amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular surface reconstruction .    2.8762132730279353
when appropriately processed and preserved , amniotic membrane as a native matrix can be used as a graft to restore conjunctival surfaces following removal of lesions such as pterygium , tumor , scar , UNK , and UNK .    2.9382191928230625
it can also be used as a graft to restore corneal surfaces suffering from limbal stem - cell deficiency .    2.785683489799305
for partial limbal deficiency , amniotic membrane alone is frequently sufficient , while for total limbal deficiency it needs to be combined with limbal stem - cell transplantation with or without corneal transplantation .    3.144478483770511
when used as a graft or patch , amniotic membrane can facilitate healing of persistent corneal ulcers and recurrent corneal erosion and reduce corneal UNK following keratectomy .    2.8331217351041293
reported data indicate that amniotic membrane transplantation facilitates rapid healing with recovery of a normal epithelial phenotype in the epithelium and reduces inflammation , vascularization , and scarring in the stroma .    3.0221921723403202
purpose : UNK of mri in radiotherapy of UNK UNK .    3.7514941170487774
background : presentation of current data and knowledge in the field of experimental and clinical UNK .    3.6578578949939144
according to the recommendations of the german ophthalmological UNK ( UNK ) , prk in myopic patients between - 1 . 0 dpt and - 6 . 0 dpt is a scientific UNK treatment .    4.067201378140749
the risks of the treatment , however , increase in myopia above - 6 . 0 dpt .    4.0290136315715
introduction : improved socio - economic conditions have led to an increase of adult height during the last century .    3.9292018397306494
if excessive height is regarded as a serious psychological UNK , final height can be reduced by early and high doses treatment with sexual steroids .    3.398874161929231
this therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents .    3.0390349762383524
for that reason patients should be carefully selected , taking into account the benefits and possible side effects .    3.156683747264892
colour measurements were performed on UNK substances of whitish to slightly yellow UNK ( cocaine samples of different composition ) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples .    3.581658706570013
the measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer ( carl - zeiss - jena UNK , UNK 400 ) using a UNK bulb as light source ( standard UNK UNK ) .    3.462112685049386
colorimetric classification was made on the basis of the cie - l * a * b * - values .    2.5656272154669932
the examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the cie - l * a * b * - measures .    2.6889116529481827
the method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin .    3.0980404560907084
eighty - five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular ( ac ) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury .    3.1225947367478426
group i included 34 patients with grade 2 sprains ( tossy ii ) and group ii included 51 patients with grade 3 injuries ( tossy iii ) .    3.082910170498772
in group i , 15 patients were treated surgically ( group i a ) and 19 patients were treated conservatively ( group i b ) , while in group ii , 41 patients were treated surgically ( group ii a ) and 10 patients were treated conservatively ( group ii b ) .    3.8021547425807487
at surgery open reduction and transarticular fixation of the ac joint with kirschner wires was performed .    3.371874102981979
conservative treatment included the initial use of a sling or a UNK bandage and early performance of range - of - motion exercises .    3.372845071471011
shoulder function was assessed according to the score devised by constant and murley .    3.533747925500883
in both groups , 97 of 100 possible points ( minimum 72 , maximum 100 ) were obtained after conservative and after surgical treatment .    3.0791422437764995
nine of 10 patients ( 90 % ) with grade 3 sprains ( group iib ) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after UNK treatment .    3.460555713482142
after surgery , dislocation and increased horizontal , mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 ( 44 % ) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains ( group ii a p < 0 . 0001 ) .    3.194424405519764
however , these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome .    2.4521934267428827
at follow - up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio - graphs ( p < 0 . 035 ) in all patients .    3.1592071791183587
again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome .    2.7356721859560067
more degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    3.3588759438201805
patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.44972084906292
patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains .    3.5917883494829814
an additional rehabilitation program guided by a UNK seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome .    3.586225922915006
a total of 56 patients were treated by surgery .    3.4828654489010478
among these patients 11 complications occurred , requiring five additional surgical procedures .    2.871119707427627
among 29 conservatively treated patients , only in 1 patient did UNK located arthritic changes of the ac joint have to be removed .    3.751212506829782
macular amyloidosis ( ma ) and lichen amyloidosus ( la ) are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching .    3.592944199389047
various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines , intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids , etretinate , uvb irradiation and UNK have been employed with variable success .    3.063757558872336
recently , in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical UNK UNK ( dmso ) .    3.5059278494462776
in our study 10 patients with either ma or la or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50 % solution of dmso in water .    3.3455600004898334
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6 - 20 weeks of treatment .    3.7238164022539713
degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by dmso is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy .    3.7537451308902368
remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect .    3.6248902840862995
histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis .    2.9326467310371527
in the follow - up period relapses of itching and papules were observed .    2.9157270654177205
therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy .    3.330994307769476
as early as 1974 , UNK advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [ 5 ] .    3.0072655464453986
he suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs , thereby improving oxygenation .    3.631849215121396
these considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [ 1 , 6 , 13 , 17 ] .    3.349365878895134
better secretion removal , decreased intrapulmonary shunting , and an increased frc are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation .    3.409190464799494
however , the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .    2.816069321591982
routine performance of thoracic ct scans in ards patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas .    2.878321008573505
the prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients , as shown by two recent studies [ 8 , 11 ] .    3.7213245250574523
the aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic ct findings in multiple - trauma patients .    2.6172035723331115
seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ards ( murray score > 2 . 5 [ 9 ] , quotient > 0 . 7 [ 4 ] , mean airway pressure > 18 cm h2o , thoracic ct scan showing dorsal atelectases ) were included in the study .    3.3803631818960898
patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12 - h intervals using an air - UNK bed ( UNK , austria ) .    3.4171811665455327
redistribution of UNK or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic ct scans ( figs .    3.8207762886198746
the patients were intermittently turned for 6 . 5 + / - 1 . 1 days .    3.2241284988789194
the course of gas exchange is shown in figs .    3.3809231649274287
initially , improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning , from the 2nd day in the supine position as well .    3.602284627433814
intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend ( figs .    3.2997821084463768
no significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed .    2.859263767886541
control thoracic ct scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas ( figs .    2.9665375977921005
the inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day ( fig .    3.224831901262252
constant levels of positive end - expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures ( fig .    3.006670179712624
repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long - lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation , which persists up to the end of the weaning process .    3.357515283582759
this is in good accordance with other studies [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 13 , 17 ] , however , this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient .    3.15114756680213
these positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation - perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position .    2.882210084416031
due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [ 11 ] and relative hyperventilation [ 7 , 16 ] , previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non - dependent after turning to the prone position .    2.552338224215968
after a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin , a 63 year old patient developed right - sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia , septic - toxic circulatory failure , and thrombocytopenia .    3.0212169796064052
heparin - associated thrombocytopenia ( hat ) type ii was diagnosed .    3.0388379802037777
UNK of this , an arterial thrombosis of the a . UNK UNK developed and had to be treated surgically .    3.9778135919431907
from this time on , no further thromboembolic complications were noticed .    3.1036437846355303
overlapping coumarin therapy was begun .    3.2398107930436546
due to ubiquitous coumarin - necrosis , rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy .    2.570434322326441
a second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin - necrosis without the need for re - operation .    2.7892102930985887
subsequent coumarin - therapy , which was gradually increased over two weeks , was without further complications .    3.687127404977007
thus , hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the UNK danaparoid in hat type ii with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin - necrosis with critical septic - toxic circulatory failure and dic .    3.214525721515274
a prospective process - analysis evaluating organizational , medical and medical - technical alterations and real - time - documentation during out - of - hospital resuscitations ( n = 71 ) was performed due to the definitions of the " utstein - style " .    3.7101215021345917
the gaseous radical nitric oxide ( no ) is UNK by conversion of l - arginine to l - UNK by one cytokine inducible form ( inos ) , which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event , and by two UNK expressed forms , endothelial ( UNK ) and neuronal ( nnos ) , which are regulated by the UNK concentration of free ca2 + .    3.5268989652916294
brain nnos is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons , which are all UNK by glutamate via the UNK n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor , which controls a ca2 + channel .    2.8180361341984916
after its diffusion into the UNK space , no may activate in neurons , which as a rule do not stain for nos , soluble UNK UNK and formation of cgmp as an intracellular messenger .    3.222837837462423
beyond that , no is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation .    3.2710023055171935
no as a UNK agent enhances disulfide bonding of UNK UNK ( UNK ) groups of the redox modulatory site of the nmda receptor complex and thereby down - regulates its ca2 + channel activity .    3.3595785935150944
histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of nos containing neurons in the UNK and UNK UNK of hypothalamic nuclei .    4.7725911520282285
numerous studies conform to the view that no participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes , especially of the UNK - releasing hormone ( crh ) neurosecretory system .    3.4416962336069066
the redox - modulatory site of the nmda receptor appears , therefore , as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical ( hpa ) axis .    2.773527549234529
moreover , glucocorticoids augment neuronal UNK by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake .    2.979348353841149
in attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with no , it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox - environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of no , acting either as a transmitter or UNK or , in the worst case , causing UNK .    3.456353467336832
it seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs UNK UNK within the central nervous system influences neuronal UNK , with no working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition , which may alter acutely or chronically , among others , the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system .    3.1821204312946114
purpose : to study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures .    3.345905354315706
even in the era of coronary stenting , acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) .    2.553782125768915
despite application of heparin and aspirin , abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2 - 8 % , depending on the definition applied .    3.6327717436047187
especially patients receiving ptca for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure .    3.086988658848039
the formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure .    2.9850908137253165
dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin .    3.191182370440666
secondary UNK were defined as myocardial infarction , necessity for bypass grafting , and death .    3.2776655675667428
the intravesical instillation of bcg ( UNK UNK - UNK ) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis .    3.926085420913634
it is UNK up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary .    3.316784881919467
in conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before bcg UNK in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value .    3.42683518563273
additionally , the legal UNK of this UNK is doubtful .    3.517804168650964
discoid meniscus is one of the UNK anatomical variations of the meniscus .    4.195499846356479
there is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus .    3.2207039943926157
according to UNK three types can be differentiated : the complete form , the incomplete form and the UNK wrisberg form .    3.816763349156318
discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment .    2.9986438198073024
partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form , while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice , since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible .    3.794403336197377
a fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly i : dysostosis UNK with hypertelorism , exophthalmus , UNK , amblyopia and cleft palate as well as UNK of the fingers and toes .    3.48811240070298
the feet showed on both side a 6 cm long horny band .    3.149541599057794
since the UNK year of life , she had suffered from papulo - pustular acne with many UNK .    3.0103812222211705
her menstruation started one year later .    3.3341609726482826
at time of her birth , her father was 54 years old , and her mother 36 years old .    3.405148026198325
two elder UNK are healthy .    3.392153999590903
the inheritance of acrocephalosyndactyly i is usually autosomal dominant , but sporadic cases are frequent .    2.877791087030211
objective : cognitive dysfunction is a known problem after operations and may be especially relevant in the elderly .    3.3252803015830508
the aim of this international multicentre study was to investigate short - and long - term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and to elucidate the relevance of hypoxaemia and hypotension as causative factors .    3.1751002119342666
autosomal recessive inheritance , intrauterine growth retardation , short stature , microcephaly , distinct facial UNK , UNK retardation , and often UNK eczematous skin lesions distinguish the rare dubowitz syndrome .    3.0070363524071326
here a pair of monozygotic twins with dubowitz syndrome and clear - cut atopic eczema is presented .    2.9354972215771755
humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively .    4.114099614932914
plating of the humerus is the established operative method , but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing .    3.375482862757495
closed reduction in 55 / 59 cases .    3.316560087351643

functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma .    3.2098202361084316
one poor functional result : periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing , possibly connected with long - term respiratory treatment after trauma .    3.160692361064983
treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic ( low complication rates , excellent or good functional results , limited approaches , small scars ) .    3.3275703690361333
proximal fractures should be treated by the seidel nail ( stable interlocking of the proximal fragment ) ; very distal fractures need prévot nailing ( reaming of condylar canals ) .    3.09089378617147
all other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic .    4.130001736816348
pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization .    3.2800977816068597
these patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma .    2.874720619323423
pseudarthrosis , according to our limited experience , seems to require plating plus bone grafting .    3.5047381675673623
plating is also recommended if revision of the radial nerve becomes necessary .    3.364631356402649
2 - 4 % of vascular injuries need operative UNK .    3.7228941993381945
in polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 % .    3.506543405956621
arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia .    2.8395249947459758
penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss , ischemia or UNK compression .    3.258217362741844
reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient .    3.1277676842096747
clinical assessment , measurement of limb pressures using a doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable UNK in the rapid evaluation .    3.6881477016590676
arteriography is rarely indicated and should be UNK for patients with abnormal physical examination .    4.824552248609377
vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity .    3.0456616561375993
in most cases autogenous vein graft is required .    2.8692043691782563
UNK , arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications .    2.883960542189659
stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction .    4.003455260581806
the initial steps to success are surgical debridement , adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation , revascularisation of vascular injury , immediate UNK decompression and early soft - tissue reconstruction .    3.0272703199147406
in secondary prevention , statins are cost - effective and even more cost - effective than other lipid lowering drugs .    3.095851130321863
statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris .    3.870427669079382
for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease , statins should be administered generously .    3.13779872964197
in primary prevention , statins are effective but not cost - efficient .    3.0620005575452804
unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women , younger patients , and in those with a low risk factor profile .    4.5824568426461
for population based primary prevention , only dietary measures can be advocated ; however , apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven .    3.3095803836500615
preventive measures have their own prize ; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it .    3.3585771592755944
therefore , such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the " direct " medical costs .    3.387265474523474
furthermore , successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads , due to life - prolongation , to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and / or disease .    3.7422873254568247
therefore , an increase especially of the " indirect " costs for unemployment , pension , nursing homes , etc .    3.4506692346457766
background : there are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase ( ck ) , its UNK mb ( ck - mb ) , UNK , and troponin can play an important role : ( 1 ) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) , ( 2 ) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage ( UNK ) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events , and ( 3 ) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis .    3.5515737071745517
mrsa / UNK infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary .    3.632965704492044
once a mrsa strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain .    3.6739035948842425
the patient has to be isolated .    3.7090349488772762
the staff has to use gloves and UNK whilst treating the patient .    3.021709901889974
a UNK hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room .    3.177707176529824
antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of mrsa / e isolates .    3.962265044659074
the problems of an mrsa case and its successful treatment are demonstrated .    3.188111006302615
a microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were UNK implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia .    3.135878787564508
the microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane .    2.997303973263056
the microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery - UNK signal amplifier .    2.9863885953846108
speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 db spl under free - field conditions .    3.0972332819774455
the patients had to estimate the quality of speech , music , and their own voice as well as the effects of bone - conducting noises .    4.205687452738435
all patients were able to UNK with the system .    3.4333117132267326
an intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems , as was understanding of UNK ( " freiburger UNK " ) .    3.3156679663091064
perception of music was judged as " clear and UNK with all broadband component . "    3.381397935917366
the estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss .    3.244340420157214
one patient declared the music to be " a little of UNK . "    3.597553611221061
bone - conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients , better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss , and " somewhat metallic " in another patient .    3.7236881856997033
hearing the own voice was considered " normal " in two cases " UNK " in one case , and " a little bit UNK " in another case .    4.162360970792706
an amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume .    3.659311259547043
on the basis of this study , essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled .    3.2315547176524917
we report a patient with metachromatic UNK ( mld ) with a first manifestation of homicide .    3.434460629985111
on admission the patient showed a UNK - like syndrom with inappropriate affect , thought disorder and behavioral changes .    3.6245829929364195
magnetic resonance tomography ( mrt ) findings suggested a diagnosis of mld , which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte UNK a and an excessive urinary UNK excretion .    3.0625116098661462
the cervical UNK myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction .    3.6611066712130125
its spontaneous course is very variable , from progress to stagnation .    3.1869621802989094
this makes prognosis and decision - making difficult for conservative or operative treatment .    3.0846324704798804
the authors attempt to provide some basis for decision - making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction , consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores .    3.1843431752835043
to advise a patient , the outcome of conservative and operative treatment as described in the literature has to be considered , as well as the possible complications .    4.290859097197119
the advantages and disadvantages of surgery from the anterior and posterior approach are discussed .    3.0329585362969653
operative planning according to the individual condition is suggested .    3.8968895030296773
operative techniques of anterior decompression and fusion are contrasted to UNK .    3.227542852495364
subject : in a 7 ; 11 year old boy with trichotillomania ( icd - 10 UNK . 3 ) , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( UNK ) ( icd - 10 UNK . 1 ) , and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction , UNK ( UNK ) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement : UNK interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair .    3.9826614802467795
an essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ecg signal is the splitting of the ecg into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees , neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information .    3.1631987960264216
the correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria .    3.9503588121568205
the analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure .    3.4746798186756465
this paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ecg .    3.266140296761772
unlike the methods used up to now , this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ecg signal into individual features .    3.3740938734522863
furthermore , analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other .    2.988452275217782
the consideration underlying the procedure is that two ecgs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses .    3.1392268972638164
as this assumption is the basis of medical experience , it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ecg with those of the leads of the reference ecgs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ecg .    3.540854964405652
for this purpose , those ecgs are searched in an ecg database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ecg .    2.5756171497826816
the function of the method was established with the aid of the ecg signal database UNK with 249 ecgs for the diagnostic groups : infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ecgs .    3.2048145687397724
it can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ecg signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts .    3.747785005276447
purpose : the technical conditions , the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy ( ve ) are presented in an overview .    2.836270885993094
during a 4 - week ambulatory UNK rehabilitation program , 262 patients with coronary artery disease ( cad ) , UNK men and 27 women , 53 . 6 + / - 10 . 2 years , performed 30 . 5 + / - 2 , 9 exercise units .    3.5252187645462856
before and after the rehabilitation program exercise , capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry .    3.2949244107590028
there was a significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program ( 105 . 3 + / - 32 . 3 vs . 121 . 9 + / - 37 . 3 w ) .    3.440716048411021
physical work capacity on the 2 . 0 mmol lactate level improved ( p < 0 . 001 ) from 72 . 2 + / - 23 . 5 to 86 . 4 + / - 25 . 8 w , on the 2 . 5 mmol / l level ( p < 0 . 001 ) from 83 . 5 + / - 23 . 2 to 97 . 4 + / - 26 . 4 w , and on the 3 . 0 mmol / l level ( p < 0 . 001 ) from 93 . 1 + / - 23 . 0 to 106 . 6 + / - 26 . 1 w . despite enhanced performance , heart rate remained unaltered on the 2 . 0 , 2 . 5 , and 3 . 0 mmol / l lactate level .    3.4780442563879714
furthermore , UNK performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) increased : 85 / min : from 56 . 0 + / - 24 . 1 to 65 . 8 + / - 24 . 5 w ; 90 / min : from 62 . 0 + / - 27 . 3 to 71 . 2 + / - 26 w ; 95 / min : from 67 . 2 + / - 26 . 4 to 77 . 5 + / - 27 . 6 w ; 100 / min : from 71 . 1 + / - 29 . 6 to 80 . 6 + / - 28 . 1 w ; 105 / min : from 69 . 8 + / - 26 . 2 to 81 . 9 + / - 28 . 2 w and 110 / min : from 73 . 6 + / - 28 . 9 to 90 . 4 + / - 29 . 4 w . the results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with cad was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program .    3.514125696891035
this improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity ; furthermore , this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates .    3.6981781353736407
the results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance , more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program .    3.2675484497676575
thus , this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and / or the investigators during the re - exercise test .    3.7365296695087915
on the contrary , our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload .    4.001805135786258
the effects were independent of pharmacological influences ( e . g . , - receptor antagonists ) .    3.392690341426322
these findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with cad .    4.25152939610841
newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries .    3.1379961502571585
missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up .    3.0779035660259053
we report the case of a now 4 - year - old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow - up procedures of a pathological screening result UNK µmol / l 17 , 6 mg % UNK .    3.1284424831073316
the main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for ffp .    3.0751877311444695
nevertheless , especially in germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood .    3.5397395445761872
however , most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood .    2.788800706835243
additionally , these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component .    3.092923948782599
on the other hand , separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood UNK to a few institutions .    3.062063134691212
we analysed all articles listed by medline during the last 12 years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates .    3.7505480128558175
in addition , all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic .    2.8278147610763797
a total of 135 original articles , abstracts , reviews , letters or UNK were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media .    2.6708493593650746
in 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied .    3.492530689220223
28 of which fulfilled the prerequisites to be included into a meta - analysis .    3.5411756988981997
the following in vitro parameters were also evaluated : ph , potassium load of the units , atp and dpg concentration of the red cells .    3.1442876037738805
whole blood ( UNK in cpda - 1 ) and red cell units ( stabilized in cpda - 1 or additive solutions ) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable ph values and red cell 2 , 3 - dpg and atp concentrations at the end of the approved storage time .    3.1769657918200274
the potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates , but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units .    3.970575147964858
a detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies .    4.050036802176227
nevertheless , a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group .    3.4254740641371715
undoubtedly , non - hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions ( nhftr ) are generally caused by an antibody - antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat .    3.632352461019778
on the other hand , there is some evidence that non - specific immunological mechanisms such as the release of histamine or cytokines are also capable of causing nhftr .    3.433002812115121
thus , these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion .    3.2988777545097046
however , so far , there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation .    3.5469925594464633
blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units .    2.8870629729109756
these fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre - storage filtration of blood , but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective .    3.3769977547584293
three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion , in two of which red cell concentrates ( at least one was free of buffy coat ) had been used .    3.5698210683926215
thus , there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood .    3.5470760008021616
after all , whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters .    3.2568134164293294
hence , a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely .    3.0982425469231916
therefore , the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations .    3.343416618707878
physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status , mobility , and quality of life .    3.0908146501053113
however , the central focus of this contribution is not on illness - specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training .    2.9234888083876407
these two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process .    3.1420699289803076
the spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated .    2.9593298760995475
even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible .    3.0033629865863913
adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life .    2.9933228305050075
the arthroscopic extraarticular bankart procedure tries to UNK the open bankart procedure .    3.518444169543774
an anterior - inferior UNK approach through the subscapular muscle permits to implant self - locking UNK into the anterior inferior third of the glenoid rim .    3.192201194027062
the extraarticular location of the implants makes a UNK capsular shift possible , if required .    3.4708214722800577
a total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996 .    2.7582307456529693
177 patients were treated only with UNK UNK device .    4.932046762237971
clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients .    3.2335835123291314
according to the rowe score 69 , 7 % were classified as excellent , 10 , 9 % as good , 9 , 7 % fair and 9 , 7 % poor .    3.6062879994798496
postoperative complications : the recurrence rate was 9 , 7 % , allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases ( 3 % ) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3 , 6 % ) .    3.7281593425831963
61 % of the patients involved in UNK or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities .    3.919858345710383
the method combines intravenous bolus application of a non - nephrotoxic , paramagnetic , extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3d data set .    3.151488021852556
high contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues , inherent three - UNK and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality .    3.4260777020216104
contrast - enhanced 3d mra is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies .    3.1914310405655866
this review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest , abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several UNK examples .    3.2231724271533073
the indications for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical .    2.5381148134142286
a generalized contraindication for mri is doubtful .    3.1193187628950634
some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa , spinal abscesses , and internal derangements for the knee , strongly recommend the advantages of mri versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques .    3.3113922904187407
mri can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by : 1 ) movement or UNK of the prosthesis , 2 ) heating , and 3 ) arrhythmias induced by electric currents , and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation .    3.4988774612013596
present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete .    3.398935371460651
therefore , a survey of twenty - five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility , safety or contraindication for mri on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998 .    3.4999153386348105
those manufacturers who UNK most of the valves in europe confirmed the safety of mri .    3.7874925160350745
however , some gave their UNK based on inadequate data , or assigned all responsibility to the physician .    2.904523535336868
some companies did not give any assurance for mri safety or failed to respond to our enquiry .    2.882719969994961
two valve manufacturers UNK against performing mri on certain prostheses .    3.0743600950499874
based on our 1998 questionnaire , the technical issues , the clinical circumstances , the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for mri on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper .    3.3010405252292068
argyrophilic UNK disease ( agd ) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain .    3.767105413942069
it is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the UNK which are UNK to an abnormal phosphorylation of the UNK associated tau protein .    4.732048023403616
histologically , it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle - shaped cellular inclusions ( argyrophilic UNK ) .    3.323283046529703
these cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern .    3.6422171471577482
the goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable agd - related changes of the brain .    3.6838966848892905
nearly one - half of the cases ( 49 % ) was UNK as demented in accordance with dsm iv - criteria .    3.8971578387817414
these results confirm the assumption that agd can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia .    2.9232790489952687
they also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still UNK disease .    3.5283699308701992
the major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy .    3.638330085243346
the following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft - tissue damage , including vascular lesions , with consecutive massive transfusion , should demonstrate that the cardiac - respiratory system can still be stabilized , even if a surgical solution seems impossible .    3.36635141192142
annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to UNK .    3.124413709667219
however , the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon .    3.268151700164041
uv light was excluded as a trigger .    3.5364474185486183
other , still unknown , factors that might change UNK of elastic fibres must be considered .    3.1821363915077576
spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors .    3.176069090563059
differential diagnosis includes skin disorders with elastolysis ; discrimination especially from mid - dermal elastolysis is not well defined .    2.918539014839943
traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis .    4.342576286953518
it is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare .    3.1241943041583444
in the period UNK 1 january 1996 and 31 december 1998 , a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with UNK plates .    3.8266131651027275
the population comprised UNK and one posterior dislocations .    3.2431194970299138
a 81 - year - old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea .    2.8347162989587247
results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right - sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus .    3.5931350047477855
because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of UNK .    3.6525108216142512
the patient died of UNK hemoptysis the next day .    2.626066879957953
at autopsy we found a 2 - cm - diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration .    3.8337820808979544
histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea , which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected .    3.6489299468836425
the benefits of epidural analgesia are well known , but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia .    3.1703716756243128
in this study , the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups .    2.959132561945308
an epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5 - 7 days .    3.947930382566134
retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given .    3.475745580843901
the side effects such as sedation , nausea and UNK were UNK partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention .    3.4844052291342433
up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic .    3.8731335896921872
complications : one patient died of cerebral UNK due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre - UNK carotid stenosis .    3.4686768919491655
there was no clinical evidence of hematoma , abscess or permanent neurological damage .    2.8184532543449503
epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia , mobilization and patient satisfaction , bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications .    3.2997308852594363
it can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy .    3.0844244454112983
high - resolution computed tomography ( hrct ) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures , air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution .    3.092194615909579
therefore , thin - section hrct with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures .    3.3275121083614283
the indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes , cholesteatoma and tumor , the " postoperative middle ear " , and malformations .    3.4654485803214112
in most cases , hrct enables differentiation between inflammatory changes , cholesteatoma , and tumor .    2.319455868608855
the excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells , of osseous defects of the UNK , of the bony UNK , and of the tympanic course of the facial canal .    4.368864964684224
in addition , hrct enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles .    2.9230862351512683
although hrct is the first method of choice , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases .    3.777381352915026
this is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by mri .    3.151479567694041
in addition , mri offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of iv contrast material .    3.060488476209426
therefore , mri may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes , cholesteatoma , and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by hrct .    2.8139246780669755
the differentiation between a UNK or UNK and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by mri .    3.4706678538150335
furthermore , mri can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes , while this is not always possible by hrct .    3.087918843871079
morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study .    2.9333488483341963
in different stages of diverticulitis ( hinchey classification : i , 8 . 6 % ; ii , 14 . 3 % ; iii , 57 . 1 % ; iv , 20 . 0 % ) mortality was 12 . 4 % .    3.798498130815352
preoperative sepsis syndrome with UNK and disturbed liver function , cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression .    3.626466984258931
accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 % .    3.4307222840541627
the stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis .    3.342909907926286
in multivariate analysis , surgical procedure ( primary resection 12 . 4 % , hartmann ' s procedure 61 . 9 % , non - resection procedures 25 . 7 % ) showed influence only on increased general complications .    3.787794232515555
the role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial .    3.40345468645581
from january 1992 to december 1996 , 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery .    3.2132790083472145
in a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique .    2.780601848537931
the results indicated that in 19 patients ( 15 . 3 % ) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique , a switch to laparotomy was required .    3.2542944736543293
the operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy ( 75 min versus 95 min ) .    3.1124350053565153
however , surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups .    2.9344857895576792
the period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations .    3.4676487493180583
according to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure .    3.2437973749636315
the patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity .    3.1971355374183013
since the first report by UNK et al .    2.903851805978908
in 1992 , the method has been refined , and its use has increased .    3.404673286319145
introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection ( elnd ) , it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice .    3.4885943590837916
slnd allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes ( false - negative rate < 2 % ) .    3.172958091258937
it distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor - free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection .    3.240693904466352
however , the slnd is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility .    2.894754569414924
although children are injured everyday through accidents , road traffic , leisure or sports activities , internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare .    3.4526270678024567
diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns .    3.2702150092910776
a retrospective , controlled study evaluates and recommends ways of treatment .    3.0159740856571844
traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16 .    3.613818673365615
the pattern of injury changed with increasing age , the trauma remaining the same .    3.354225140151079
most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) .    2.8645441886090395
main cause where sports activities .    3.2030352498016263
operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment .    3.7543670254653456
osseous avulsions of the UNK and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture .    3.8488760144458
suturing of intraligamentous acl - ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results .    3.6636579492981314
secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children .    3.763980815418338
children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are UNK .    3.283027268232017
trauma , surgery , pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the UNK - motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy .    3.7643019401760878
malignant mixed müllerian tumours ( mmmt ) are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites .    2.909478158125531
we report a case of a 46 - year - old female with mmmt with primary occurrence in the greater omentum .    2.819518255956248
only 19 cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature .    3.389412968019519
the clinical appearance , diagnosis , therapy , histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed .    3.3155230177006305
the publication of the UNK statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials .    4.048327701144349
it contains the most important standards of high quality research .    4.046800342311507
although originally meant for randomized studies only most aspects of this statement can be applied to other kinds of clinical studies .    3.2374535408717255
the demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher .    3.918947883699244
in the region of the ankle joint , it is therefore ideal to use the UNK for pathology .    4.126476219768658
indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are : soft tissue impingement , ligament instability , impingement in the UNK , osteochondral lesions , loose bodies , arthrosis , and loose os UNK of the talus .    3.514124071374575
in the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments , loose bodies , and synovitis with soft tissue impingement .    3.316708830145046
a new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint .    2.8903043368083408
the reported high incidence of complications , especially in terms of neurovascular lesions , can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non - invasive distraction of the joint .    4.466234249303799
although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders , it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept . [ 125 ] .    3.4887004898753236
compared to the intense international discussion on the subject , in germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia : while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept , psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem UNK about alexithymia ' s role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease .    3.1544697011560627
our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to UNK in their data with modern , UNK founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain .    3.0775622245329473
in the etiopathology of tension type headache , vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed .    2.9405012859169672
fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the ihs were investigated using the tcd - ergometer - test - a method used to evaluate the UNK mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects .    3.551302901898475
an immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic UNK leukemia ( cml ) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon ( ifn ) and chemotherapy .    3.6749387497294683
following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of UNK + megakaryocytes , including their precursors with fiber density .    3.2554824102049245
this finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis .    2.7923252825915656
the latter was observed in about 28 % of patients already at diagnosis .    4.006173775123576
in a similar way , the frequency of cd68 + macrophages was correlated with the amount of UNK + nucleated UNK precursors , UNK an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover , hemoglobin synthesis , and degradation of the expelled nuclei from UNK .    3.129051250217773
the ( - d - UNK residue - expressing ) pseudo - UNK cells were detectable in 30 % of pretreatment specimens .    3.491164601473625
moreover , significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level , percentages of myelo - and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood , and spleen size .    2.735880923200292
these variables are in keeping with more advanced stages of cml .    3.2019537266844718
based on our morphometric evaluations , a classification into three different histological subgroups : granulocytic , megakaryocytic , and myelofibrotic was carried out .    2.6742492804453932
this simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data .    3.1483959583032215
sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by ifn , hydroxyurea ( hu ) , or UNK ( UNK ) revealed a fibrogenic effect of ifn in contrast to a fiber - reducing property of hu .    3.536964231556357
the dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices .    3.1028659395841056
these included the ratios between quantitative differences of corresponding variables at repeated examinations and time .    2.96082475418407
thus , in patients with complete hematological remission following ifn administration , regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of cd68 + macrophages , including activated subpopulations .    3.332235849345466
histological subgroups showed a transition from a ( UNK ) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40 % of patients .    3.5583855131844544
in conclusion , the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in cml warrants a careful morphological evaluation of UNK biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and , thus , allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process .    3.1862531592799357
computer - aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical UNK leads to simplification of this investigation , and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed .    3.401985039585998
simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized .    3.8769195695528396
in contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the icp reaches a plateau .    3.267535762479593
our mathematical method UNK with the description of a pressure - dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models .    3.6008125170668848
for that we are able to take the non - UNK of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration .    4.0459908185119335
the intrathecal infusion test is a reliable diagnostic method for measuring resistance and compliance in patients suspected of having normal pressure hydrocephalus .    3.2613501510382097
primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is UNK by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma , especially in conjunction with UNK or thoracic trauma .    5.071681158303088
this also applies to unreamed medullary nailing .    3.041274539815609
primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure , the timing of which is not predictable .    3.639768552674488
plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure , but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation .    3.716208408890739
in a prospective study conducted from 1 september 1994 to 30 june 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients ( average iss : 30 points ) , simple femoral stem fractures ( a - 1 to b - 3 of the ao - classification ) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique .    3.1174865706924444
while cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone , a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression .    2.932960456486622
at least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate .    3.2196836179622874
this allows micro - movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue .    3.520724313891607
all of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident .    3.1304162304911127
ornithine UNK deficiency is an x - linked disorder of the urea - cycle .    3.760673357193001
with a prevalance of 1 : 14000 it is one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism .    2.841443504032837
heterozygous females exposed to high protein nutrition or protein UNK , are faced with highly detrimental effects UNK their lives .    3.2633012609360765
coumarin necrosis is a rare , but life - threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy .    3.2211385482095243
UNK areas are the breasts , hips , gluteal region , thighs or lower legs .    2.880461497148639
thrombotic tendencies , such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation , lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis .    3.8517708953913625
a direct , toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role .    3.306737755569016
although the incidence is only 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 % , lethality lies at 15 % , the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment UNK .    4.288276875673246
the therapy of choice is early fibrinolysis .    2.7458326499223373
with special emphasis on pediatric aspects , the presently available data on the effectiveness and safety or specific immunotherapy with house dust UNK extracts are reviewed .    3.334146069267336
in addition to antiinflammatory treatment and allergen avoidance , specific immunotherapy offers an approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma in those patients sensitized against house dust mites .    3.262340663569394
controlled studies of specific immunotherapy against house dust mites show decreased symptom - medication scores and positiv effects on some lung function parameters .    2.684975408286203
therapeutic efficacy appears to be better in pediatric patients .    3.8506186802812925
severe side effects seem to be rare , but are more common in patients with chronic airway obstruction , in infants and with UNK - immunotherapy .    5.01040263628457
from january 1996 UNK february 1997 6 , UNK patients were treated by our group with ptca and 3 , UNK ( 60 . 5 % ) received one or several stents .    3.984026555036694
an angiographic follow up was achieved in 63 % of the patients with 1 , UNK experiencing restenosis ( 32 . 8 % ) .    3.7741341537325828
of those UNK treated with re - ptca 302 were randomly selected for further analysis .    3.080379943995696
in - stent - restenosis was treated with UNK in 8 patients ( 2 . 7 % ) , with UNK laser in 21 ( 7 . 0 % ) and with another stent in 48 patients ( 15 . 9 % ) .    4.516344447369607
225 patients ( 74 . 4 % ) of this UNK were treated with UNK only .    5.085644478714848
it is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) , whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here .    2.9057600470173646
regulations concerning prevention ( § 20 sgb v ) , precautionary medical services ( § 23 sgb v ) and health examination ( § 25 UNK v ) offer no legal basis for cost coverage .    3.1075954327469364
pep is patient care in the sense of § 27 sgb v . however , this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations .    3.3586803860438446
this should be achieved soon , in order to eliminate legal ambiguities in this area .    3.2931502946773885
the principles of the so called " new methods of examination and treatment " legal construct may support cost coverage liability .    3.1068745687833816
on the whole , however , german - austrian recommendations concerning indication and use of pep must be formulated more UNK and UNK .    3.396853587397399
if a doctor , in the case of an indication according to the german - austrian recommendations , does not prescribe pep , this would probably not be malpractice , because there are still many scientific questions to be answered .    3.5344328610157656
to clarify the functional mechanism of the esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea , its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied UNK with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle , the genioglossal muscle , and the UNK muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome .    4.016010630009683
during the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea .    2.994397239449832
no significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea , but , after the obstructive and central apnea , significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand .    3.269963108647295
the amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance , and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance .    3.5756053994550867
the results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx .    2.938094060090703
the analysis of the UNK UNK disordered UNK into a hospital order institution reveals a lot of very conscious and well organized behavior during the criminal activity .    3.311456854406016
this must be taken into account in therapy and prognosis .    3.370835128013327
the prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many UNK and developing countries and growing to a world - wide medical and socio - economic problem .    2.947439295465481
in a recent report of the who the world - wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority .    3.267183373596792
inadequate long - term results of weight reduction in children and adolescents and the increasing socio - economic burden to the health systems , as well as the high grade of persistence of obesity UNK the problem and demand primary prevention efforts . future directions of primary prevention measures could be the time of onset of obesity , the " early adiposity rebound " , intrauterine malnutrition , weight gain during infancy , low energy expenditure in infants , familial adiposity , composition of food and modification of fat intake .    3.2874646369595286
despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery , necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem .    3.573291513994874
under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography ( mrt ) is the gold standard for early diagnosis .    3.4167741743143814
because of magnetic interference , this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation , however .    3.862690349318215
this seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography : contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under x - ray control and the venous flow is documented .    3.4789830627295055
furthermore , it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas .    2.8735834220920777
ossovenography was performed in 12 patients and the results were compared with histological samples .    4.743156691156921
in every patient in whom necrosis of the femoral head was diagnosed by ossovenography ( 91 . 6 % ) , we also found necrosis on histological examination .    3.728406218449856
in one patient in whom physiological flow was found , there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample .    3.4178325221170924
there were no complications during ossovenography .    2.6710570000086626
the results suggest that ossovenography is a promising and reliable method for early diagnosis of necrosis of the femoral head in the presence of internal fixation devices .    3.6300668197329444
to evaluate patients with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death the analysis of ventricular late potentials , heart rate variability and UNK is helpful .    3.6702286374199398
however , the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy .    3.109496310514222
in this study the impact of the UNK for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated .    3.9942765986197215
the results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra - abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated , including the procedure and complications .    3.470778202277622
for the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control .    3.249339883683797
we placed a UNK or UNK UNK catheter by UNK or trocar technique into the abscesses .    3.4751449188612393
the primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 % .    3.3100886612488125
complications occurred in 6 . 4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 % .    4.226504291714243
this method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients .    2.9260511010836368
ultrasound - guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses , especially in the critically ill patient .    3.5291302533361173
acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure ( icp ) .    3.11282238134784
it is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors ( metabolic disturbances , hypoxia and hypercapnia , circulatory instability ) UNK brain edema and UNK recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently .    3.0844501253420886
medical therapies for further treatment of elevated icp depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness .    3.594980058220503
the different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and icp elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery UNK or complete hemispheric infarction .    3.154940366928764
an algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed .    3.5807886359799976
in an investigation of infection control methods for respirator systems in 89 randomly selected german intensive care units as a part of the UNK study ( nosocomial infections in germany - surveillance and prevention ) , it was found that respirator systems were exchanged daily in about 50 % of the intensive care units .    3.656425342916996
however , UNK et al .    2.497376388093644
found that changing circuits ( including UNK and exhalation valve and the attached UNK ) every 24 h rather than every 48 h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia .    3.3931226474787297
the key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins ( e . g . , collagen ) , proteoglycans , and glycoproteins ( e . g . , fibronectin ) as well as by well - defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix .    3.372481316290016
it has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor - and interleukin - 1 , for example , induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the UNK and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin - 8 concentration .    3.420900128637299
the proteases ( e . g . , matrix metalloproteinase - 8 ) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already UNK ( loss of UNK ) collagenous fiber network .    3.0357696821428806
the clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition .    3.3945655117688456
objectives : the involvement of cytokines in degeneration and inflammation of human tissue is well established .    3.169256937652102
interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) is a major agent in the pathophysiology of periarticular bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoporosis .    3.606319752989544
because the use of recombinant cytokines and growth factors is limited due to their short half lives , techniques are needed to get a permanent release of these therapeutic proteins .    3.4825201882858345
the rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene lacz and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist protein ( il - 1ra ) .    3.0697567446329805
different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro .    4.028675383971218
the - galactosidase ( lacz ) gene and the cdna of il - 1ra were introduced into the isolated cells by UNK mediated gene transfer .    3.1875484858547405
lacz activity was determined by UNK staining , il - 1ra was measured quantitatively by elisa .    3.7202300704003264
results : the transfer of retroviral il - 1ra led to il - 1ra expression of UNK to UNK irap / UNK cells / 48h .    3.2793889304744033
by combining different techniques to improve transduction , the x - UNK staining established a rate of transduction of 60 % .    3.377577304834602
conclusion : our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human UNK cells is possible in vitro , and leads to high levels of the synthesized UNK product .    3.03370453442504
the rate of retroviral transduction can be accelerated in vitro .    2.965412129953507
to provide a brief review of the current state of topical treatment with UNK or acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) for therapy of chronic pain syndromes .    3.7587406478505554
we report a 72 - year - old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months .    2.7426596845745888
since the ct scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base , we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism .    3.706084496718774
the majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment .    3.201129567959489
lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space , while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare .    3.3256179060519777
retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures .    3.598465325506866
the survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma , the time of diagnosis , and a situation - adapted therapeutic strategy .    3.822561449602863
the treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients .    3.017355220931111
early pelvic stabilization , e . g . , with external fixation , is recommended in these patients .    3.2654910999696005
central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or UNK space should be treated surgically , as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients .    3.331926489794164
duodenal or pancreatic injuries need surgical exploration in the majority of patients ; the therapeutic spectrum ranges from simple sutures to UNK resection .    3.408977429316809
the treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma .    3.485840778603956
early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair , while deviation UNK or a hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses , peritonitis , or severe concomitant diseases .    3.5181924849739046
long - lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation ; in these severe cases , laparotomy should be aimed towards primary " damage control " and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient .    3.426205995311371
surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries , often involving the femoral vein .    3.6761570480087986
because of the famous case presented by roux in 1813 , the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable , but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to UNK the femoral artery .    3.0229321368863307
UNK ' s principle ( UNK ) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes .    3.9657192154249024
this surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever .    4.062875051601434
in the limb , the congestion induced in the vein had a UNK effect on the healing process .    3.4351259514748604
the surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially ( UNK ) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment UNK .    3.5332154480462594
the first thrombectomy was performed in 1937 , but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the UNK annual meeting of the german society of surgery in the following year .    4.2131245234435575
bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare .    3.031019267880333
however , their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses .    3.524841787687129
further , venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular UNK .    3.4081458906407858
in the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super - selective angiography and embolization .    2.725984124381414
complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid - transcervical approach without any further functional UNK .    2.866178394892884
middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus .    3.153858247608051
as the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery , venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein .    3.2006533033095708
a sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side .    3.1605936142368
intoxication is the UNK reaction of the cns to UNK psychoactive substances .    3.631770727313214
intoxication - like conditions may also occur without taking drugs .    3.496632854201932
we then use the term " ecstasy " .    3.0867944848964175
intoxication can follow typical or atypical course .    3.1295950175256477
the main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood , affect , drive and initiative , train of thought and self - control .    2.793147307370975
the diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course , occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication .    3.2219375899107883
in a meta - analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies , we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations .    3.98790334889296
UNK hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair - growth - promoting agents .    3.7261187330489594
such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen - induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles , especially of the shortened anagen phase , and thus protect from increased hair loss .    3.347771593173309
true evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic , since UNK , the method UNK applied by the manufacturers , fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity , especially the duration of anagen stage .    3.7765110684440053
for example , an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage , but may also be due to shortened hair cycles .    3.450286703210243
accordingly , drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics .    3.0324099830545643
for this approach dna - UNK of the outer root sheath in UNK anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair UNK taken by UNK techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth .    3.13429657094139
the calcaneus pseudathrosis is UNK seen in clinical workday and we UNK find any case be reported .    3.056014338820897
in two UNK the authors present the diagnosis and therapie of a non - union after a calcaneus fracture .    3.6830438881933407
the authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture .    2.557658423683775
a general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given .    4.62521690587586
the remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100 % , for completely treated local relapses approximately 70 % .    3.270156392802303
the complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well - tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone .    2.8483229076404593
however , thromboembolism of the vertebral artery UNK the internal mammary artery may occur .    3.2397130385066415
the indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board .    3.1223763687724775
in the country city of UNK , germany all cases of varicella - zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists , pediatricians and general UNK were registered over a period of 16 months , from february 1992 until may 1993 .    3.3165426592852723
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and UNK patients with chickenpox .    4.004140038307707
the population - based incidence of zoster infections was 22 . 6 per 10 , 000 inhabitants per year , while the incidence of chickenpox was 42 . 4 .    3.5358018749941458
there was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster .    3.1070578983603827
there was also a marked influence of age and sex , on the localization of the involved nerve segments .    3.2508373110462334
zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients .    4.360134909083908
the peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade .    3.9197237474139217
in patients with chickenpox , the sex ratio was equal .    3.176796127934816
the disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade .    3.910731248279592
paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes ( pns ) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to UNK or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment .    3.4623559446976473
most frequently , pns occur in association with small - cell lung , breast or ovarian carcinomas .    2.9220170882857848
the most frequent pns is lambert - eaton myasthenic syndrome , which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma .    2.767568516905817
pns have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies .    2.997352359527358
in certain neurologic syndromes ( sensible and autonomic neuropathy , UNK , limbic encephalitis , UNK - myoclonus syndrome , stiff - man syndrome , neuromyotonia , subacute amaurosis ) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm .    3.191990832561321
pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against ( 1 ) voltage gated calcium channels ( UNK ) in lambert - eaton myasthenic syndrome , ( 2 ) voltage gated potassium channels ( UNK ) in neuromyotonia , and ( 3 ) UNK in cancer associated retinopathy .    3.670847953253343
the present article deals with the neurological symptoms of pns , associated tumors , and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of pns .    4.156868526494918
ewing ' s sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has , however , attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy .    3.416095961523648
its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time , including a possible origin in immature UNK , UNK , endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells .    3.824373078229556
convincing arguments , however , have only been brought forward during recent years , since it was found that ewing ' s sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11 ; 22 .    3.1535370021780293
in the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses .    2.6894616437560663
there seems to be no clear border between ewing ' s sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation .    2.76711976364394
in most cases , they can be distinguished from lymphoma ( leucocyte common antigen , b and t markers ) and embryonal UNK ( muscle specific actin , desmin ) without problems .    2.9337355908949267
apart from that , it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the mic 2 - protein , which is preferably expressed in ewing sarcoma .    3.6693607626469835
the diagnostics of ewing ' s sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t ( 11 ; 22 ) can be proved molecular biologically .    3.048037290036399
in contrast to the cytogenetic evidence , it is not necessary to establish cell cultures .    3.239766448411149
contrast enhanced ( ce ) magnetic resonance angiography UNK angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value .    2.9610119675280226
a prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three - dimensional gradient - echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a t1 - shortening contrast agent .    3.1566202688288123
we describe the dependence of the quality of ce - mra on technical parameters of different mr - scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection .    2.912978978599295
the present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas , whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration .    3.169374319938658
owing to advances in adjuvant therapy , the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades .    3.5203988091874194
this applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates .    2.875612193150494
the diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined .    3.052334989315266
technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures , such as UNK - UNK resection at the shoulder , internal UNK , proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented .    3.708269365006109
the use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures .    3.5898550367173097
in the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk - adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery .    3.6962543906624203
in 10 - 30 % of cases , locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis ; a further 25 % develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence .    3.374082273219261
in treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall , axillary or UNK disease surgery plays a major role .    3.792206615963871
since - another long - lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation , recurrence is not an infrequent event , and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach .    3.3565040429634894
surgical techniques such as local , myocutaneous or UNK flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection .    3.145294910543977
additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem : locoregional or systemic chemotherapy , topical application of chemotherapy , certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy ( pdt ) .    3.0313497245195147
the most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life .    2.970856634889813
in acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae .    3.5073719382578505
thus , diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role .    3.0612040141800754
if acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child , imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses .    3.6123445484861745
this is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated .    2.985169650985857
if the diagnosis is unclear , the next step should be either mri or 99m tc - UNK bone scan , depending on the possibility of clinical localization and the site of the suspected lesion .    3.615926006436617
mri is superior to bone scan in UNK the exact anatomy , which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively .    3.99849873544707
the bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis .    3.2604307535777908
rarely scintigraphy with UNK white blood cells is indicated .    3.386610795975067
the 67 UNK scan , however , should not be used in children because of the high level of radiation exposure .    4.724958575023616
the different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined .    3.1116863584628875
secondary corrections involve upper lip , nose , and palate ( fissures ) .    2.869041630025099
in some cases , it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla .    3.231293595785786
finally , there are indications for speech improving measures and total UNK .    3.40681254474768
dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant - borne UNK work .    4.046753738850784
in this paper , some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described , which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary clp care .    3.4439631114838694
damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of UNK and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) are the main lethal factors in UNK patients .    3.6649429832304956
however , no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy .    3.08650792106229
we report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42 % and 48 % respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ards .    2.677041944931949
both patients were treated with bovine surfactant ( UNK ) .    3.1902585877744243
the therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored .    3.2637025096339105
intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial o2 pressure ( pao2 ) ; inspired o2 concentration ( fio2 ) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance .    3.167031581261523
both patients survived this critical situation .    2.9868485059054053
we conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in UNK victims with ards is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high - risk patients .    3.288232816319875
the main aesthetic concern of patients with angle class ii deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face .    3.087811145627193
it is the orthodontist ' s task to correct this deformity insofar as possible .    2.605124989079384
depending on the extent , even UNK at the beginning of their training will recognize this .    3.503780066925353
since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure , the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .    3.381857992237239
it is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class ii deformities , skeletal deep bite , and a short lower face .    3.6274426722244093
presurgical orthodontic treatment and the surgical procedure to correct the deformity are discussed .    4.005808844532734
the treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of UNK , depending on the extent of the deformity , to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function , aesthetics , and stability .    3.9415618925879583
it can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure .    3.7561994549695163
adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the " real - life - test " is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery .    3.220987757976322
necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of " transsexual defense " and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity .    3.297770610507979
usually UNK of transsexual patients , who decide over somatic sex reassignement , have to UNK also in psychotherapy in a broad sense .    3.737213541184245
within the setting of the " administrative - psychotherapeutic split " the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders .    2.947051406175049
in this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery .    2.993643400267308
during recent years in the german federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms .    3.2600730828981686
the hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected .    3.282259834695868
from this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result .    3.186816214339907
cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and UNK to outpatient services despite unknown UNK follow - up care .    4.154405257758012
mostly the elderly are affected .    3.7676083124608826
medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between sgb v and sgb xi .    3.2190150921592813
however , this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit UNK ( rehabilitation before nursing , priority of home , etc . ) .    2.522475186726632
right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors .    3.637257850885369
various medical , nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation .    3.8652052310787828
in 1995 the ethics commission of the medical university of lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure ( pid ) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation UNK .    2.9853259135317796
the couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening .    3.0368117463594104
ethically , the performance of a pid was certainly warranted for this couple .    3.393835444187779
the risk of UNK UNK section 1 and / or 2 section 1 ( " UNK cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes " ) of the law for the protection of embryos ( eschg ) was judged to be UNK in written statements from two expert witnesses ( prof . k . v .    3.546452973267908
UNK and prof . h . m . UNK , both UNK ) .    3.594439939966092
in the view of the ethics commission , only UNK section 2 ( " an ovum shall be UNK only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy " ) of the eschg currently UNK pids .    3.665481888240331
in light of the social and biological arguments in favor of pids , however , the ethics commission questioned whether this section of the eschg is still morally justifiable .    3.279095994432474
a 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta - abdominal aorta bypass ( UNK ) .    2.965862624434203
the diagnosis of a severe UNK stenosis had been confirmed by aortography .    3.2144350509149318
preoperatively the patient suffered from extreme hypertension and claudicatio intermittens .    3.381544100816027
after prosthetic repair of coarctation , blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared .    3.0638842161947872
in this report , we discuss various surgical techniques and the most important question concerning the optimal timing of surgical repair of aortic coarctation .    3.4744523806612766
iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy .    3.4168074529576784
we report on eleven UNK recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998 .    2.788940439067479
in seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason .    3.125711148029074
nine women and two men ( age range 56 to 92 years ) were affected .    3.538166847353856
in 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon .    3.6153131563678658
all patients were operated on and five sutures , five resections and one colostomy were performed .    2.8372836210975936
no significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain .    3.370613207380163
only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups .    3.360992567041831
indications of mr arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study .    3.679151709081558
the aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional mri , establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients .    3.407896989800836
nerve fibre - neuroendocrine cell complexes ( nf - nec - c ' s ) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of UNK ' s plexus .    2.947335652813948
we report on a patient with sporadic UNK - UNK syndrome ( zes ) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple nf - nec - c ' s in non - UNK gastric mucosa .    2.7719087873230523
it is suspected that in zes the UNK may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of nf - nec - c ' s in the gastric mucosa .    2.6474496789708275
introduction : the prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation , is especially in multi - system - trauma cases , recognized to be the " gold standard " .    3.076235830621942
thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general , the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation , is becoming of increasing importance .    3.997737256527602
thereby we must take into consideration the limited UNK , which are afflicted with a high degree of UNK , which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation .    4.06177817355241
the purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients , was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings , to identify areas for procedural optimization .    3.35605339977395
staging of any tumor , i . e .    2.9675040102829167
determination of the extent of the disease , serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies , such as chemotherapy or irradiation .    3.5930675253949205
furthermore , accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis , for radiation therapy planning , and for differentiation of those with small - cell lung cancer or for follow - up examinations of small - cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy .    3.4918230380544113
the primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography ( ct ) of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands , abdominal sonography , and bone scintigraphy .    3.297939559171054
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) should be reserved for specific indications , e . g .    2.5031114433728905
infiltration of the chest wall or staging of patients with intolerance / allergy to intravenous contrast medium .    4.272279581848852
the clinical value of nuclear medicine techniques , such as [ 18f ] 2 - fluoride - 2 - UNK - d - glucose positron emission tomography ( fdg - pet ) for evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases , in - 111 octreotide / UNK receptor scans for staging of small - cell lung cancer , and thallium - 201 spect are currently being assessed in numerous studies , although these techniques are already in routine use .    3.269722884553797
in future these or nuclear medicine techniques , as well as techniques using molecular - based contrast material , especially for mr imaging , currently in experimental status , may yield serious potential for staging purposes .    3.34085447729007
background : we investigated fundus autofluorescence in vivo using a novel scanning laser ophthalmoscope .    2.8695910623699254
myocardial infarctions may be UNK by external triggers .    3.9142322576097732
external triggers include physical activity and emotional stress as well as other infrequent triggers such as war threats or UNK .    3.239836642963973
changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions ; circadian , seasonal , and weekly variations have been observed .    3.1504358595126303
patients ' behavior at the onset of symptoms depends on various factors and influences outcome and mortality .    3.2677215283889574
appropriate preventive measures are indicated in order to protect patients during vulnerable periods .    3.987405633134101
health education should be directed towards patients ' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms .    2.911224842855988
introduction : in patients with neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumors and liver metastases , but without known extrahepatic manifestations , liver transplantation may be indicated as UNK or " long - term - UNK " therapy .    4.151825934860165
for these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory .    3.8402983705803617
a patient suffering from long - standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury - containing drug .    3.1991359804591446
exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed .    3.4331995103149113
mercury levels in blood and urine were increased .    3.6943561817053676
after withdrawal of the mercury preparation , therapy with UNK ( 2 , 3 - UNK - 1 - propane - UNK acid ) , a mercury UNK , was initiated , together with short - term treatment with aromatic UNK and puva .    4.460164031226282
within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared .    3.2782369084346126
based on the results of chromosome analysis from cell cultures and testis biopsies , the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in infertile men is up to 20 % .    3.281651588499286
chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting .    3.2896475755261263
of all infertile males , 7 - 9 % show numerical and / or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes .    3.397962364042956
there is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities , with 21 % of patients with non - obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality , most often klinefelter ' s syndrome .    3.2192879921757527
the rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9 % in patients with severe UNK ( less than 5 million / ml ) , and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group .    4.244499745848308
using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells .    3.08497952038763
there is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid ( UNK ) sperm cells than fertile men .    3.2058953343366667
taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men , an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely .    3.054732077721396
chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with icsi as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions .    3.498856120736448
background : tufted angioma represents a benign vascular lesion of the skin .    3.3105843464732585
the knowledge of this distinctive entity is important in distinction of clinically more aggressive and malignant neoplasms respectively .    2.9303803174609024
limb lengthening in dwarfism has become a standardised procedure with a good prognosis .    3.1450320584365676
in most cases external fixation is used .    3.201288130841529
gain of leg length up to 15 cm and more is possible in the lower leg and the femur and 8 . 5 cm in the humerus .    3.9807752823062597
limb lengthening is useful in many cases of dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia .    3.0436861134131887
there are a number of risks and possible complications involved and the procedure also requires considerable time .    3.3308480790271777
we report the results of 48 patients with dwarfism operated on in the orthopädische UNK UNK ( orthopaedic hospital for children ) .    3.3161157371963372
process - experiential ( pe ) therapy is a neo - humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client - centered emphasis on a genuine , UNK , empathic relationship and the active , task - focused process - directive style of gestalt therapy .    1.711412239722594
a research - informed treatment ( grawe 1997 ) , its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory .    2.0987594064413453
it incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks , each of which is characterized by a specific client marker and resolution state , series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution , and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps .    1.6881772465952145
the first part of this review provides an overview of process - experiential therapy , including theoretical foundation , that is , emotion theory , dialectical UNK , and task analytic process orientation , and the basic treatment principles .    3.5727806830845306
malnutrition is a common finding amongst our UNK .    4.194924935595954
the causes of malnutrition are multifactorial and although they have been extensively studied , they are not entirely understood .    3.145819175374241
both physiological and pathological processes of aging put this population at a higher risk of being UNK .    3.288789886295559
these may be related to social , financial , psychological and / or physiological changes directly or indirectly associated to growing old .    3.3303100540027684
we report on a 76 - year - old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema .    2.731755533083641
plasma UNK levels were slightly elevated , but advanced radiologic techniques revealed no evidence of an underlying pancreatic tumour .    3.054391871356754
the dermatosis responded excellently to oral therapy with dapsone .    3.224849202274139
the possible aetiology and pathogenesis of the " UNK syndrome " are discussed .    3.6799276560131156
complications during cataract surgery such as dropped nucleus or lens fragment dislocation into the vitreous cavity may become sight threatening .    2.8046130515465917
the recommendations regarding possible therapeutic approaches are inconsistent .    3.4293376991605
several factors like uveitis and / or an increased intraocular pressure play a major role in the decision on the further surgical procedure .    3.506512700013498
the authors describe the histopathology of the resting cartilage and the growth plate in a case of UNK dysplasia and review the differential diagnosis with UNK dysplasia and UNK type ii .    3.5117213556598426
objective : hypoplastic left heart ( hlh ) is a complex developmental malformation of the left ventricle , aorta , and associated valves .    3.5483913873345743
survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants .    3.2061667512358745
the prognosis , however , is no longer UNK .    3.88385279736743
clinical stabilization of a neonate with hlh is appropriate until a management decision , based on appropriate parental counselling , can be made .    3.264531589210125
forty - one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion - weighted echo - planar imaging ( dwi ) and t2 - weighted imaging ( t2wi ) .    3.06883241431523
in 8 patients only dwi showed the cerebral lesions clearly .    3.062895229421482
one patient with positive dwi and t2wi suffered from hsv encephalitis .    2.75437805696498
dwi is superior to t2wi in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions .    3.548506367525519
dwi is not specific , so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered .    2.9283702866502357
this disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities .    3.348335155483013
the etiology of cronkhite - canada syndrome ( ccs ) , however , is still not well understood .    3.25691019195525
interestingly , among patients with ccs a significant correlation ( 16 . 5 % ) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed .    3.512205476164266
thus , malignant transformation and / or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease .    3.7118944375580054
in the following , epidemiology , symptoms , morphology and therapy of ccs are discussed .    2.994060448188497
our examinations are based on studies reported in the literature and on a case report of a female patient who developed a colon carcinoma 2 years after initial diagnosis of ccs .    4.166982196118553
pacemaker erythema is a rare , irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers , clinically characterized by UNK teleangiectatic erythema .    3.7220518627322434
we report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation .    2.6720829326048756
the pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown .    2.8736315469280798
in contrast to peri - or postoperative pacemaker infections , physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism .    3.0282998111515167
allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results .    3.065093944359905
the present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an UNK to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations .    3.2026571771202725
the physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription , the period of time the drug is prescribed for , numerous cross references , and other special regulations , and he still cannot be sure that he does not UNK certain legal requirements .    2.9035688011300453
often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment !    3.3445313140838677
in the authors ' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without UNK the safety of the drug control system .    3.3023007137124023
it is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § 13 abs .    3.0655223872225115
1 of the drug control regulation , as judged by the responsible UNK of the drug , and that any offence be UNK .    4.086054954219395
the use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof .    2.8743691273060996
legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations , which are difficult to handle .    3.869470603092244
the aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it ' s influence on muscle function .    2.767026398579956
33 male patients after acl - rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch - UNK - method to determine the maximal UNK contraction force ( UNK ) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily .    3.9031833129278937
the results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated acl - rupture and to an aged - matched control group .    3.4125298134987525
managed care , i . e . , the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization , is gaining importance in the usa health market .    3.2689291684644193
the initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance UNK , a very attractive feature for employers .    3.7773626996795513
managed care promises to contain UNK for health care .    3.062965742578099
given the shrinking public resources in germany , managed care seems attractive for the german health system , too .    3.028633007673133
in this review the development of managed care , the principal elements , forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined .    3.252595337096307
the regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives UNK the autonomy of physicians : the physician must act as a " double agent " , caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation .    3.2927840549630454
cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals ( and partly by restricting care for patients ) .    3.2085623863976167
only a fraction of this cost reduction was UNK over to the UNK or UNK , and most of the UNK was returned with profit to the UNK of the managed care organisations .    5.020092021342786
the UNK role of primary care physicians as UNK of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular .    3.7452426754285244
the paradigm of managed care , i . e . , to guide the patient and the care UNK through the health care system in order to achieve cost - effective and high quality care , seems very attractive .    3.603046201479223
the stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the german health system , in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in german law .    3.3509120805915584
background : analysis of the impact of head fractures , intracranial hemorrhages , brain edema , and prognostic risk factors on long - term outcome in children with severe head injury .    3.4727086757091166
background : in the past , the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect .    3.4609532509837053
since the target tissue is not directly observable , no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon .    3.3240342050063867
high inter - and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under - or overdosage .    3.1706062200667184
UNK is therapeutically UNK , while overdosage causes the so - called " UNK " which may induce severe damage to the eye .    3.259182919322263
in the past , most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability ( hrv ) were done using commercial holter ecg devices with traditional magnetic UNK .    2.666498232035147
all methods to calculate parameters of hrv are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats , in practice rr intervals .    3.579183623385807
hence , results of hrv calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition .    3.963516012621734
however , technical standards on accuracy of rr interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state holter ecg systems do not exist as yet .    2.8030761359277894
therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of hrv parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real - time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial holter ecg systems [ UNK medical ( e ) , oxford medilog excel ( o ) and medset UNK ( m ) ] .    2.8828636540609907
a computer - based ecg simulator was used to UNK a test signal consisting of artificial p - qrs complexes of fixed rate , UNK stabilized " sinus rhythms " .    3.0338513991795972
two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously .    2.9489070313628907
the influence of recording technology on accuracy of rr interval measurement and consequently on time UNK hrv was shown by comparing five standard 24 - h time domain parameters .    2.7333261466978445
as expected , in the three holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher , technically induced , artificial rr variability .    3.638693445053822
the sdnn values ( e : 9 . 38ms vs 2 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ; o : 3 . 89ms vs 0 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ; m : 10 . UNK vs 2 . 89ms ; p = 0 . 001 ) , sdnn - index values ( e : 8 . UNK vs 0 . 90ms ; p < 0 . 001 ; o : 3 . UNK vs 0 . 90ms ; p < 0 . 001 ; m : 7 . UNK vs 1 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 ) and rmssd - values ( e : 10 . UNK vs 2 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ; o : 10 . UNK vs 1 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 ; m : 8 . UNK vs 1 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems , UNK ( m : 9 . UNK vs 5 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ) in the medset system too .    2.597391285314718
the used method is a possible way to validate commercial holter ecg systems for hrv analysis .    3.245446235320209
clinical significance of artifical hrv seems to be low .    3.7474973259855906
cases of gallstone ileus ( 108 ) were analyzed retrospectively over 30 years .    3.068830645490764
even today , when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is done , the incidence of this rare disease remains the same .    3.5517421887933405
history , clinical and x - ray findings are non - specific .    3.1874619422509713
UNK was seen in 17 % of the patients .    3.3363795152976627
since 1992 sonography has UNK an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases .    3.465496381264127
in the triad of known gallstone , non - specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction , and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder , there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus .    3.4604681384964153
the evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the UNK .    3.5648261233859264
intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 % , and UNK fistulas were encountered in 83 % .    4.2593665052481136
autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the UNK anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of UNK techniques .    3.5816359626056937
recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions .    3.5496054946695135
however , attempts to restore forearm , hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far .    3.145364465007438
therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making , selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and UNK postoperative management .    3.100016633772585
leg venectasia is a common problem .    3.4917574306684607
although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities , none of them gives satisfactory results .    2.997227727126815
the effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor .    3.673341089645963
UNK and argon laser treatment often result in scarring .    2.880454683844871
we studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of UNK nm in the treatment of leg venectasia .    3.0090709185760915
after repeated treatments using this laser system , only 30 % of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed ; we obtained better UNK of smaller red , UNK vessels with a diameter up to 0 . 4 mm .    3.685936163327354
however , hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment .    2.9888286563282063
in post - treatment biopsies , occlusion of the vessels was found .    3.5612127615401272
based on these results , we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia .    3.3281708702397728
larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy , while UNK telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser .    3.511168284773995
total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients .    2.9232405957643217
a less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only , leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ .    3.6293843840081306
hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past , because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery .    3.521543546692166
in the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an al2o3 - ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients .    2.564282005710642
from 1985 to 1990 UNK patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty .    3.6816701884970047
the average age at the time of accident and operation was 81 . 7 years .    3.1689451724173012
at the time of follow - up in 1993 only 77 survivors were available for examination .    3.2399284500377448
a standardized score was calculated assessing activity , gait , hip pain , etc . , with the patients obtaining an average score of 58 out of a possible 78 points .    3.750825394367921
two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup , leaving the stem in situ .    2.6841016693628283
in view of the small number of approach - related complications , hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an al2o3 - ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients .    2.5590234503564773
in the rare patient with protrusio acetabuli , revision surgery can be performed to replace the cup , leaving the stem in situ .    2.8396376692826286
functional relaxation ( fe ) , a somato - psychotherapeutic method , can reduce asthmatic symptoms .    3.3666595536810857
the efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation ( efe ) is compared with a placebo - relaxation - method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of fe , and a standardised pharmacological UNK test using salbutamol .    3.4755904287581267
in a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method .    2.834446803767716
before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had UNK pulmonary function testing .    3.698818980416777
u - tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable .    3.9124491174740594
the before - after - comparison revealed significant changes for efe and salbutamol , not for the placebo - relaxation .    2.855288621772473
there were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo - relaxation , not between efe and salbutamol or efe and the placebo - relaxation .    2.846716940645789
fe can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma .    3.71677439336883
the following three case studies will prove , that the sonographic diagnosis of a fatty liver is often related to a metabolic disease , beginning at the age of 4 to 5 years in conjunction with the morbus wilson .    3.702316075907039
3d ultrasound will find in the next years a wide popularity under the medical imaging applications .    3.313321531897104
the method expands the well - known sonography on the third dimension , therefore it becomes possible to generate spatial 3d views of internal organs .    3.0324309864902554
it is further possible to display static ( 3d ) as well as dynamic organs ( UNK , e . g .    3.5313980550560276
the clarity of the three - dimensional presentation supports very effectively the navigation .    3.2013390771112764
58 patients following gustilo iiib open tibial fractures , treated by serial debridements , osteosynthesis and microvascular free tissue transfer were investigated after an average of 6 years .    2.980011490339743
assessment of life satisfaction was done by means of a proven valid and reliable test instrument ( UNK - " UNK zur UNK " ) .    3.7914484936299
further specific questions on treatment satisfaction , aesthetic result , occupation and income were added to this questionnaire .    2.9088853362480633
significant discrepancies of the items recreational activities , income , occupation and partnership , productivity , mobility and pain were evaluated in comparison to available data of healthy west german population .    3.1215107304938443
the calculated global index of life satisfaction and health differed significantly from the established index of west german population .    2.755881330729151
although specific aspects like aesthetic result , donor site morbidity , pain and even function were critically judged , 91 % of the patients were satisfied with the long term result of the treatment .    3.8513613136312688
none of the patients thought that an initial amputation probably might have been a better solution .    3.4610745937709786
the UNK employment rate was 64 % .    3.1017651704910856
limb salvage of gustilo iiib fractures by means of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol is able to afford useful and satisfying long time results .    3.248345627772006
however , an impairment of quality of life , at least in specific items has to be considered .    3.1652827354617226
the case of a 10 - year - old boy with post - traumatic priapism after perineal trauma is presented .    2.992418056511032
the literature and the diagnostic possibilities resulting from color duplex sonography are discussed .    3.250611954338542
only 53 % - 58 % of patients with a subarachnoid haemorrhage ( UNK ) following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm survive without neurological damage .    4.112173480752115
morbidity and mortality are closely related to the delayed ischaemic neurological deficit due to cerebral vasospasm .    2.931212176022908
the following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms ; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists , UNK haemodilution , and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature .    3.2945817312179124
during the last decade an unusual amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis has been described in association with autoimmune disease in sixteen female patients .    3.030668130861835
the clinical hallmark is a sterile pustular dermatosis preferentially located in intertriginous regions that responds to local or systemic corticosteroids .    2.72714199966133
histologic features are UNK sometimes UNK neutrophilic UNK .    3.2061053467779006
we report an additional patient suffering from this unusual dermatosis .    3.128986492825353
an overview of the patients described to date and a review of the literature are given in an attempt to delineate this amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis from the known pustular dermatoses .    3.23017350216612
the area " environment and health " is characterized by interdisciplinary features and , consequently , an intense need for communication .    3.2507116858391685
in addition it has to be considered that sometimes there are difficulties in terms of information search .    3.667854025548773
a comparison of national problem solving strategies concerning electronic network activities within this area led to the development project for a european information and communication platform .    3.094542930438389
by this electronic platform the international exchange of experiences , coordination of activities , UNK efforts and an optimization of qualification possibilities for environmental health professionals will become easier .    2.7375118144365462
objectives intertrochanteric adduction osteotomy to delay or prevent the development of a UNK osteoarthritis .    3.69186347078483
no removal of bony wedge thus avoiding leg shortening .    3.102557009308007
the aim of this study was to analyze the localization and distribution of extracellular matrix in normal and glaucomatous damaged optic discs using immunohistochemical methods .    2.580051483982253
five eyes UNK for corneal UNK without any history of glaucoma and three other eyes with secondary glaucoma were studied .    2.874105399174411
immunohistochemical reactions were performed with antibodies against collagen types i , iii , iv and vi and against laminin , proliferating antigen ki 67 and gfap .    3.0737425856269023
in glaucomatous eyes the characteristic arrangement of collagen fibrils is lacking .    3.058809382866258
septa of the lamina cribrosa appear enlarged .    3.5018807900274207
the immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes .    3.0116460521629618
the axon basement membranes show an irregular and interrupted pattern .    2.9739683915583983
the number of proliferating cells with positive gfap staining in glaucomatous UNK plates is distinctly higher .    2.94482331827079
we postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation .    2.6914333028669133
associated UNK and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and , secondarily , to neural degeneration .    3.2825934427672445
concomitant pathologies ( labral lesions , intra - / extra - osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema ) in adult residual hip dysplasia ( rhd ) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery .    2.991077161199866
the aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative mr arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in rhd .    3.0048659138022757
the first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow - up of 18 months have been analysed .    3.9895428636138113
all 37 patients presented rhd with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative mra .    3.240095645482004
according to clinical , radiological and mr UNK criteria , these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups : ( 1 ) reorientation of the acetabulum using the UNK triple pelvic osteotomy ( tpo ) ; ( 2 ) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy ( UNK ) ; ( 3 ) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum ( pall ) ; ( 4 ) primary total hip replacement ( tep ) .    3.5239278746383746
based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups , the following conclusions can be drawn : labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability .    3.1548394273853395
therefore , acetabular UNK should be corrected by UNK osteotomy of the acetabulum ( tpo - subgroup ) even in low grades of rhd if labral lesions are present .    3.009964715060583
" palliative " labral resections without corrective osteotomy ( pall subgroup ) in secondary osteoarthritis due to rhd are definitively obsolete , because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability .    2.7786152050413406
in rhd with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions , one should not hesitate to perform primary thr even in young patients .    2.9925876650633496
severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus .    3.617906962602739
in this connection , open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned .    3.495353938854001
in the department of traumatology , UNK , in 1995 three patients ( all male , average age 35 . 3 + / - 10 . 2 years ) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus .    3.577916773831971
in two of these cases third - degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained .    3.904892379272947
the third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital .    3.036991182793193
in each case a UNK infection was the outcome .    3.5172140362724695
following a step - by - step algorithm , in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done .    3.0386444706457407
to maintain UNK between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os UNK on the other , the bony defect was filled with pmma chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection .    3.62644814722046
after second - and third - look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days .    3.361928276484491
after 17 . 6 + / - 3 . 3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft , combined with double arthrodesis in two cases , and external fixation for the next 4 - 5 weeks .    3.89472872920622
in the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done .    3.167787167983246
at follow - up after an average of 12 months ( range 8 - 17 months ) , the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases .    3.851526753046899
all patients are free of symptoms in normal life .    3.4650088927931417
in the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible .    3.2456024786004822
the combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum .    3.295837359124771
meningitis caused by streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in austria .    3.617324361455457
sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia , disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment .    2.944907536037654
being a farmer , the patient belongs to a recognized high - risk - group , as most other infected people do .    4.11254284062881
the results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis , and thus , are in contrast to the UNK - pig - model by kay , who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss .    3.4009888705538365
the present knowledge of streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology , pathogenesis , epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed .    3.075601019781534
the introduction of atypical antipsychotics has presented new options for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenic patients .    2.890591034104835
it is assumed that in the near future , neuroleptic medication will shift from conventional to atypical antipsychotics for an increasing number of patients .    2.8206685268142553
the present article addresses guidelines for the conversion from conventional to atypical neuroleptics in inpatient and outpatient settings .    2.7778687352300993
numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18 .    4.105204914174151
to study this , the data of UNK patients with multiple traumata , treated between 1981 and 1991 at hannover medical school , germany , were retrospectively analyzed .    3.93625762452727
the patients were divided into four age - related groups : UNK age ( < 6 years ) , school age ( < 13 years ) , teenagers ( < 18 years ) and adults ( l 18 years ) .    3.4634233855142655
analyzed were the cause of trauma , localization of injuries and the cause of death .    4.0655124855878
children were less often injured as passengers in cars , but more often injured as pedestrians and UNK than adults .    2.9421129070328678
however , children showed a significant higher mortality than adults , with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents .    3.3643055374769237
in all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common .    3.8538110365022757
children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax , abdomen , hip and arms than the adult group .    2.9650127703911124
nevertheless , trauma to the thorax , abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups .    3.3074570724707972
spinal cord injuries , especially injuries to the neck , also showed a high risk of death .    4.1463552012611675
children younger than 6 years had the most severe head injuries .    3.8555946608697123
safety improvements for children in cars , UNK usage on UNK and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients .    3.432755323897573
during the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the childs - phillips method .    3.0615380681558193
of those , 37 were subsequently examined for the study - 7 patients had died in the meantime .    3.8212851101548213
none of the deaths occurred as a direct result of UNK small - bowel plication .    3.3768056768439743
an early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in 4 . 4 % and a laparotomy was repeated .    3.703429121372037
during the most recent examinations 86 . 5 % of those patients checked had ( virtually ) no complaints - 91 . 9 % based upon the visick classification .    3.7282622842027364
a subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8 . 1 % of cases , but could be conservatively treated .    4.475667138815446
up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence .    3.3127260386832855
most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences .    3.4255200347712296
on the basis of our results , we are of the opinion that plication in the presence of existing peritonitis , as well as partial plication , is acceptable .    3.7487510117996306
to prospectively survey skin lesions in a large group of newborns , as no such study has as yet been performed in germany .    3.2439832440880783
we present the case of a 35 - year - old patient suffering from UNK psychosis .    2.8753069406840686
after 4 weeks on UNK he developed acute priapism .    3.118031943421562
possible explanations and pathophysiology are discussed as well as the requirement for sufficient information of the patient .    3.7415778377166826
delay of urgent urologic treatment UNK the risk of irreversible UNK .    4.081462874584956
the patient ' s history should be evaluated with respect to former unphysiological prolonged erections .    3.3771566047345583
the further development of 162 stroke patients ( average age 77 years ) , who were UNK assessed during hospitalization , was evaluated ca .    3.5216613222593756
questionnaires were mailed to patients .    2.902016602190287
53 % of the patients ( n = 86 ) returned the questionnaire UNK filled in ; 20 % ( n = 32 ) had died ; in the remaining 27 % of cases ( n = 44 ) no information was obtained on further development .    4.143529050849169
80 % of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems .    3.267869343412906
family members assumed most of the care required .    3.990852289341385
follow - up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic .    3.7673016111979027
the barthel index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital .    3.1043570956844775
hardly anyone among those patients received follow - up treatment .    4.072884723615709
74 % of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor .    3.768726357661935
for those patients who died in the 18 months interval , significantly lower values for the activities of daily living ( adl ) has already been recorded upon hospitalization .    3.2930745969154698
they had a less favorable view of their state of health and were less satisfied with life in general .    3.3040718195442493
the routine staging work - up for renal cancer includes a contrast - enhanced UNK spiral ct and a chest radiograph .    3.331938107819872
if there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of ( UNK ) ivc thrombus , mr imaging should be performed .    3.431671154088786
dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging should be used in place of ct in any patient with severe renal dysfunction , symptomatic polycystic kidney disease , or a history of allergy to UNK contrast media .    3.688456936284288
cavography is no longer needed in the era of ( adaptive array UNK ) spiral ct and mr UNK .    3.6369531275915303
patients : we report on four infants with nonketotic UNK , three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form .    3.469166806278166
despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate , two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of 16 and 50 months , respectively , only one survived severely retarded with seizures , UNK and spastic UNK .    3.6685051113009024
the serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid / serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome .    2.6931536773950095
the patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan , and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development .    3.1515675398632177
immunosuppression - related candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro - inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators , notably tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - ) , interleukin 1 ( il - 1 ) , and gamma - interferon ( gamma - ifn ) .    3.052133240298973
important but UNK differences in the UNK of fungal vs . bacterial infections make such cytokine priming appear contrary to current strategies for reducing cytokine - mediated organ injury and mortality due to gram - negative UNK and UNK .    3.3135786302799053
UNK , preclinical studies to date have found that the UNK of such UNK does not compromise , and actually may improve , the efficacy of synthetic antifungals .    3.8418090236488527
bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism .    3.602308977597735
using a bilateral approach , preoperative localization studies are not mandatory .    3.1292092095480717
a localized single gland disease is the basis for a minimally invasive procedure .    3.4888628225329588
therefore preoperative localization techniques play an important role in planning ( minimally invasive ) first time exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism .    2.916574995325039
the combination of 99 UNK - UNK scintigraphy with ultrasound allows correct localization of the parathyroid adenoma in 86 % of all single gland diseases .    3.8477744914354655
multiple gland disease could be predicted in isolated cases only .    3.213293415604541
computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging could not improve the results .    3.472594514027556
surgery for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism should only be performed after positive localization studies .    3.3097769011871696
prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of > 90 min compared to in - hospital therapy is expected .    3.401716738590027
it has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy .    2.8542142951076293
more than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the ems may be treated within 90 min after symptom onset , enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk .    3.528472220455924
thus , prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window , without additional risk .    3.060409537675013
low resection and intersphincteric extirpation of rectal cancer in the distal third of the rectum has become an accepted sphincter - saving method .    3.5657394042415667
from december 1990 to december 1994 , 42 patients ( 17 women and 25 men ) with a mean age of 67 . 2 years had a low resection or extirpation of the rectum at our institution .    3.6441499107958513
eighteen patients received a transanal sutured anastomosis , 24 a UNK anastomosis .    3.249957248561923
we had a lethality rate of 2 . 5 % and a anastomotic insufficiency rate of 14 % .    3.7000119331776213
" notox histological UNK " is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation .    3.152105179347745
intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested .    3.1974925054081247
notox was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step , otherwise the same manufacturer - specified protocols were used for all UNK .    3.2241231419092875
conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations , especially for tumour diagnosis , were used .    3.476115086101121
in all tests , results with notox - fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis .    2.9844672748487193
notox is a useful substitute for formaldehyde .    3.7788303833498036
the aim of this article is to provide current information on morphological parameters useful for a forensic age estimation of human skin wounds .    2.712588693783609
in addition to mainly cellular reactions detectable by routine histological or enzyme histochemical techniques , immunohistochemical parameters and their forensic value are especially discussed .    2.6814360251447162
a dynamic helical ct scan following initial ultrasound provides reliable radiological staging for kidney traumas and immediate diagnosis of most abdominal injuries .    2.8581194345085565
it also proves useful for pediatric traumas .    3.2788503497638666
using mainly ct data we apply a classification system proposed by the american association for surgery of trauma ( grade i - v ) .    3.0782339713244853
the diagnostic steps and subsequent management are demonstrated by flow - chart .    3.154253980710715
most renal traumas may be treated conservatively but persistent bleeding or persistent urinary extravasation may necessitate surgical intervention .    3.114661577611862
in cases of exploration of the kidney , the use of fibrin adhesive , alloplastic mesh capsule and UNK stents enables the reconstruction of the kidney .    3.4936782859870803
with worldwide over UNK applications , vascular closure devices have been established as an essential tool of invasive cardiology .    3.265939547999174
this overview compares today ' s four commercially available closure devices , vasoseal ( vs ) , angio - sealtm ( as ) , UNK , inc . ( pc ) and UNK ( du ) for their usefulness after coronary interventions .    3.2250522127406125
the published data regarding deployment success rates for vs , as , pc and du are in the range of 88 % , 91 % , 90 % and 98 % up to 100 % , respectively .    3.384999870481255
times to hemostasis were 5 - 13 ' , 2 - 4 ' , 11 - 19 ' and 4 - 14 ' , accompanied by times to mobilization of 6 - 9h , 6 - UNK , 4 - UNK and 2 - UNK .    4.302584663665229
minor complications were described in 8 % , 5 . 9 % , 5 . 3 % and 2 . 1 % , major complications in 5 . 3 % , 1 . 3 % , 4 % and 2 . 6 % .    4.612767623855774
although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression , all UNK devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis .    3.764340944865857
the increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after ptca .    3.478024082852289
vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge .    3.0446546671905055
amniotic fluid is a major factor of the intrauterine environment , and deviation from the normal volume is associated with an increased perinatal morbidity and mortality .    3.2586200644635253
polyhydramnios occurs in 0 . 2 to 1 . 6 % of pregnancies .    4.1517303584100596
it may be due to a number of congenital anomalies , an abnormal karyotype , maternal diabetes , rh - disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non - invasive or invasive measures .    3.3335534288712045
however , the most common indication for prenatal intervention due to polyhydramnios is the twin - twin - transfusion syndrom ( ttts ) .    2.830642894317543
treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion , or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid .    3.146350018198637
maternal administration of UNK inhibitors represents a further , non - invasive therapeutic option .    3.8171194324440654
indomethacin , UNK , or UNK reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures .    3.4847500725450757
however , potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application .    3.4334153174134765
percutaneous amniotic fluid drainage may provide immediate reduction of intrauterine pressure , but is associated with a complication rate of 1 to 1 . 5 % .    3.814487993918305
the hemodynamic characteristics of UNK pregnancies complicated by ttts have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment .    3.0306266327179108
treatment is only required in a small UNK of pregnancies with polyhydramnios .    3.389671704375783
mild cases can be managed UNK .    3.9557364467756484
intrauterine pressure increases with an excessive increase in amniotic fluid volume ( UNK > 400 mm or UNK > 150 mm ) leads to the elevation of intrauterine pressure .    3.1788999919468854
complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery .    3.187284837152681
the main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and / or the UNK of maternal symptoms .    3.4424095189428274
with the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging , frame - based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation , also called UNK stereotaxy .    2.828401966434921
it allows transfer of individual patient ' s images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas .    3.1617636134579947
the different localization techniques employed are articulated position - sensing arms , infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope .    2.86511032344105
in 200 operations performed with different systems ( arm - based , robotic and infrared ) the method proved to be helpful , enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed .    3.270790183512775
with a mean deviation of 2 . 87 + / - 1 . 9 mm for intraoperative localization , the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame - based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm .    3.433504651940214
neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions , skull - base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality .    3.204393982204004
the major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation , leading to UNK when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue .    3.566726966228629
intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) might be a solution for this problem .    2.9642495776035322
with the method of intraoperative mri developed in our department it has already been possible to update neuronavigation with images reflecting intraoperative changes in anatomy .    3.248881379865753
therefore , neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine , and it will also spread into other surgical specialties .    3.076490494032775
severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation ( bmt ) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment .    3.0435335582436265
cognitive and psychological disturbances are frequent complications subsequent to bmt and may result from cerebral opioid side effects .    3.5135945927173258
the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side - effects in bmt patients .    2.7755597879862988
methods while in hospital , 10 bmt patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale , subjective visual analog scales ( vas ) for pain and mood parameters , a german version of the UNK pain questionnaire ( mpq ) , and a mental performance task battery , and the morphine given was documented .    3.8981612357345745
mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time .    3.2301009787257375
seven patients also performed a sternberg memory search test in which they had to use ' yes ' and ' no ' response keys to UNK visually presented test letters to a previously UNK set of letters .    2.849495558214809
practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before bmt .    3.9063246341461073
results the intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient , resulting in different pain intensities and mpq scores .    3.3697971673839184
prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity ( spearman rs = 0 . 88 , p < 0 . 01 ) but not with morphine dose ( rs = 0 . 35 , p = 0 . 33 ) .    3.388666335408578
for the sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose ( rs = 0 . 86 , p = 0 . UNK ) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity ( rs = 0 . 61 , p = 0 . 15 ) .    2.812742275029207
in turn , pain intensity , unlike morphine dose , was significantly correlated with high scores in the mood parameters for depression , passivity , and tiredness .    3.1900678591616782
conclusions it is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance , but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria .    3.118548721875302
whereas pain might slow reaction time by UNK a patient ' s attention , particularly in low mental demand tasks , morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes , such as short - term memory operations , that are required in more complex tasks .    3.656031812592135
the case of a 63 - year - old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described .    3.0140049449521937
histopathological and UNK examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of UNK neoplasia .    3.8403604412278085
the patient died in acute cardiac failure , five weeks after initial presentation .    2.9652375249067684
autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium .    3.0539113435733003
the tumor cells were reactive for UNK , vimentin and UNK esterase , but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against UNK and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c - kit ( UNK ) , characteristic markers for mast cells .    3.236023099681161
however , the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis .    3.2416031966451744
the cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic UNK tumor nodule .    3.0652299623021775
thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients .    3.3081586916522228
in some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process .    3.4704221614897817
we report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions , in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential ( borderline - tumors ) of UNK and peritoneum were diagnosed later on .    3.6009396291861724
in one case the removal of the tumor stopped the coagulation problems .    3.306364089438397
the second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion .    3.1186903107190096
in stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind .    2.918776837501699
the diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when UNK therapie was ineffective .    2.7705904717142444
UNK coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases .    3.5067433614773913
brain - stem gliomas occur mainly in childhood and are localized in the UNK , pons and UNK UNK .    3.934877656822668
diagnosis is a domain of mri , requiring t2 , t1 and km .    3.0502254081607907
ct shows hemorrhage and calcification well .    3.23058940865501
the criteria are the primary site , size , tumor growth , brain - stem enlargement , delineation , intralesional structure , exophytic components and enhancement .    2.992367078718488
secondary criteria are herniation , hydrocephalus and UNK seeding .    3.1073083528691203
in ct glioma are hypodense , in mri UNK in t2 and UNK in t1 .    3.427480528338797
enhancement is seen in 25 - 60 % and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or UNK .    3.7078640867251966
factors influencing poor outcome are high grade , a short history , cranial nerve involvement , severe brain - stem enlargement , pontine site , diffuse growth and UNK .    3.0667005952690265
the 5 - year - survival rate is 30 % ( after radiation : focal tumors 85 % , diffuse 20 % ) .    3.08458773481462
most frequent are symptoms of brain pressure , cerebellum , cranial nerves and pyramidal tract .    2.9218275704441976
a diagnosis of tumor is highly suggestive if classical mri findings fit the clinical history .    3.0619819545453177
radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation .    3.1910409080759767
we report the result of 23 women and 22 men ( median age 48 years ) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the gesellschaft für UNK ( UNK ) , darmstadt , from december 1997 until september 1999 .    3.302935660284607
the study included patients with chordomas ( 17 ) , chondrosarcomas ( 10 ) and other skull base tumors ( table 1 ) .    2.8029200276032147
it is the first time that the intensity - controlled UNK - technique and the application of positron - emission tomography ( pet ) for quality assurance was used .    3.2663295877349365
all patients had computed tomography for three - dimensional - treatment planning ( figure 1 ) .    3.137457840695881
patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days ( median total dose 60 gye ) .    2.758058230055471
other UNK were treated with carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 gye delivered to the UNK tumor after fractionated UNK radiotherapy ( median total dose 63 gye ) .    3.5110088078201818
mean follow - up was 9 months .    3.3422431524365663
irradiation was well tolerated by all patients .    3.5512436922191264
partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients ( 15 , 5 % ) ( figure 2 ) .    4.156586002417692
one - year local control rate was 94 % .    3.4000894477152745
one patient ( 2 , 2 % ) deceased .    4.245350566571444
no severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed .    2.9216598184593794
to continue our project a new heavy ion UNK exclusively for clinical use is UNK to be constructed in heidelberg .    3.312029876958377
indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule , and more rarely in fractures .    3.3547945357008992
anterior shoulder dislocation is common .    3.59847053934182
over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice .    3.091774095204085
isolated ruptures of the collateral ligaments of the knee can be treated functionally .    4.296638198761052
a torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises .    3.366781901965714
chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by UNK grafting techniques .    3.269130083837451
menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically .    3.915434862948838
objective : comparison of low back pain ( lbp ) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome ( fms ) with regard to affective distress .    3.2246304710376883
methods : patients with lbp who had been admitted to various clinics in germany were examined upon admission .    2.914718052290005
comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of fms .    3.48098056579179
additionally , both groups were compared after being matched according to sex , age , and pain severity .    3.4410010088656677
results : 15 out of 135 lbp patients met the american college of rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia .    2.5501547574779724
patients with fms showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress .    2.724729846949901
after controlling for different levels of pain severity , these pronounced differences disappeared .    3.1545555789872135
conclusion : affective distress is not a unique feature of fms , but seem to be caused entirely by higher levels of pain severity .    3.275471138736588
methods : cases of invasive hi - infections were reported in a national active surveillance program .    2.9681249192217756
the case definition required the typical clinical picture and a hi positive culture from a physiologically sterile site ( or throat swab or tracheal UNK in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia ) in children up to 10 years .    3.2122981782755775
all initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status , type of vaccine , therapy , outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria .    3.873805336004017
the relation between the type of UNK vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame .    3.420230991033485
results : 310 confirmed cases of invasive hi infections were reported during the observation period , 199 of these with meningitis , 56 with epiglottitis .    2.8790235885884834
the number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992 , 120 in 1993 , and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995 .    3.3594532951415483
in 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1 . 1 / 100 000 for all infection sites and 0 . 7 / 100 000 for meningitis .    3.8987437749410985
the reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of UNK cases , whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children UNK between 22 and 36 per year .    4.055100934014538
most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children , who according to the german recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection .    3.571105795841243
the type of vaccine ( UNK , UNK - d or UNK ) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children .    4.69052020930044
10 % of the bacteria produced UNK .    4.5417081109123645
in accordance with the german recommendations third generation UNK were used in almost all cases of meningitis .    3.443566469259367
one third of these , however , received additional antibiotics .    4.1908815846833845
conclusions : the present incidence of systemic hi infections in germany is low .    3.3401264510883877
a further decrease , however , would be possible with " on time " completion of the vaccination schedule according to the german recommendations in all children .    3.5745053994721236
for more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery .    3.004850529560889
intraoperative lesions of the UNK lining by UNK , ischemia , UNK , and foreign bodies result in complaints , intestinal obstruction , female infertility , and problems during reoperations .    4.308210282394059
the global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion - related complications and subsequent socio - economic implications .    3.178680309848481
scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing .    2.777678901450436
even today the name of f . d . von recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism .    2.9044999787737944
he was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones , and in many aspects his work remains valid today .    3.7259702294405317
he succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases .    3.319973238650197
he also described the phenomenon of " bone remodeling " which has become relevant today again .    2.990043043945254
although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include UNK precise UNK which make it difficult to study them today , they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas .    3.3685506313419427
this article does not constitute a comprehensive biography , but it contains a description of f . d . von recklinghausen ' s important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life .    2.930287361883881
soft - tissue sarcomas ( sts ) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences .    3.7614110886372765
limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation .    2.903594286110057
in order to evaluate isolated UNK limb perfusion ( ilp ) in a multimodality therapy concept , we reviewed our patients treated using this method .    3.0905297349359335
between january 1982 and december 1995 , 25 UNK , using cisplatin , melphalan and adriamycin , were performed in 22 patients with sts .    3.0855158921735417
forty percent were treated for local recurrences ; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( mfh ) and synovial sarcoma .    2.7463643252839716
most of the cases ( 14 ) underwent wide or radical resection , 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy , and 5 were treated with external beam radiation .    3.8255680688130465
complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases .    3.2852170945617405
with a median follow - up of 45 months ( range 1 - 143 ) , the 5 - year overall survival rate was 81 % .    3.6881305661626795
the median recurrence - free time was 19 months and the 5 - year disease - free survival rate 34 % .    3.2321469270299787
there were 13 local failures , and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients .    3.0551661802795995
concerning high - grade sarcomas ( uicc stage iib , iiia / b ) , we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases .    4.098422262163386
five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation , and 7 incompletely resected sts received ilp without reoperation .    2.861897885719783
all of these demonstrated local recurrence .    3.1106116356044615
this rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor - free resection margins ( p = 0 . 0001 , log - rank test ) .    3.2965161239076552
the amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % ( mean 11 months after treatment ) .    3.4665689353838562
long - term results of ilp showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease - free survival .    3.266003163761446
perfusion in patients without tumor - free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence .    3.377980522732706
we conclude that ilp with cisplatin , melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice .    3.0613932056169313
infections with the UNK bacterium clostridium difficile occurs mostly in worst ill , UNK patients treated with UNK or antibiotics .    4.368239919718045
we report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment .    2.5951246861420256
we report the case of a 21 - year - old woman with definite hd whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years .    2.4679874150556667
one reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual , very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of hd compared with that of other affected relatives .    2.947177907005987
the phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the UNK transmitted mutated gene .    3.7585339157599353
diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history .    3.5719534458852613
icd - 10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in germany soon .    3.3841795991884216
for everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by dimdi : icd - 10 meta files , icd conversion tables , icd - 10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms .    1.7006367245300695
all files are available free of charge via the internet .    1.965083757939142
because of poorly UNK UNK soft tissues , total UNK claviculectomy in cases of UNK with cortical destruction is always marginal .    3.501198927119215
due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined , literature UNK on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle .    3.5335792068557694
thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue - type plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) has proved to be an established method ; but intra - and postoperatively , there is a high risk of bleeding complications .    3.7054954166470164
a 50 - year old female with familiar UNK and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture .    2.9851173625954726
intraoperatively , UNK suddenly dropped , paco2 rose , and circulatory arrest occurred .    2.916440035612616
cpr was started immediately with closed - chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines .    3.0369487677866203
while continuing cpr , surgery was stopped , the wound was sealed UNK , and the patient was transferred to the icu .    3.4404877164123557
because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism , thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun .    2.8991490277366876
2 . 25 hours after the onset of UNK arrest , and 1 . 5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis , the patient ' s hemodynamic patterns under high - dosage catecholamines were satisfactory .    3.864383051403342
the bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions .    3.020873556847377
the situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver , spleen and small intestines , which required surgical intervention , and acute renal failure , which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration .    3.4677323370279423
a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs , capnometry , blood gas analysis , and electrocardiography .    3.6366660148923913
the patient survived without any neurological deficiency , despite the extended 135 - min use of cpr , and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma , and to performing cpr in the presence of UNK .    3.237201150198539
with the increasing use of cross - sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms , more and more right atrial thrombi are detected .    3.47008124112005
these are so - called " UNK " from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease .    3.34258448737243
they appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually UNK with an already massive embolism .    3.6343990893523634
in patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale , paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed .    3.1447541260088028
right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment .    3.484978910629855
in our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years .    3.603796858781795
three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism , seven patients presented with a UNK embolism .    3.460292514363517
all patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography .    2.6934907597034696
in about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring .    3.716495176640067
therapeutic options were thrombectomy , fibrinolysis or anticoagulants .    2.9614028046539405
we treated one of our patients with thrombectomy , eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants .    3.5164343661945328
the era of modern anaesthesia in germany began on january UNK , 1847 .    3.2845605939616718
this day , professor in ordinary johann ferdinand heyfelder UNK a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the university of erlangen .    3.522016384899521
by march 17th , 1847 , heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether .    2.883452149387485
the operations in majority were teeth - extractions , and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a UNK or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint .    4.044994720375493
heyfelder described in detail 108 of these inhalations in a little book entitled the experiments with sulphuric ether .    3.0444455972602444
this UNK published in march , 1847 , represents one of the first complete UNK on sulphuric ether in the german literature .    3.2592342426660963
in a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during UNK .    3.536060640619515
in 1847 , heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt - ether in man .    3.2590044986366613
after 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether .    2.6037794584280114
advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction .    3.510461383844814
disadvantageous were its high UNK , its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form .    3.3803905843495774
from december , 1847 , on heyfelder started to use chloroform .    3.0230328677820886
he was now able to perform more major operations , for example the total resection of the hip - joint .    3.7781070882539516
in his book the experiments with sulphuric ether , salt ether , and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents .    2.74427232123674
in his summary heyfelder concluded , that chloroform was UNK superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper UNK .    2.92141687818103
moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus .    3.1112302430193193
however , because of its great anaesthetic potency , heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform .    3.166859381938219
UNK he expected an assistant for UNK , whose only duty was to UNK the inhalations and the patient - a UNK of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist .    4.428310520535344
background : to evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the german anaesthesia UNK ( UNK ) in medline - listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the european society of anaesthesiologists ( UNK ) .    2.8254124140004397
in particular , the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination , because the large " cystic " cavities of the brain can easily be imaged .    3.2849060125764633
sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs , but also the development of structural abnormalities .    3.9393447773110464
approximately one - third of all congenital anomalies , originate from the central nervous system ( cns ) .    2.6657798929322545
based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early cns anomalies , we recognize some sonographic signs of an early cns anomaly : ( 1 ) apparent UNK of the brain or the head ; ( 2 ) altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with UNK of the brain compartments , where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal ; ( 3 ) in the early fetal period , choroid UNK that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall ; ( 4 ) irregular contour of the spine / back ; ( 5 ) extra - cns anomalies .    3.5885188830563948
telomerase is an enzyme that UNK UNK repeats , the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of UNK shortening .    2.936623014514166
over 85 % of human tumours , and 95 % of non - melanocytic skin cancers , show telomerase activity , in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues .    3.759511568602356
this suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis .    2.9252694494994067
recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues , but also in some normal tissues .    3.190966731016982
in the skin , this activity has been UNK to the stem - cell - bearing epidermal basal cell layer , possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase - competent stem cells .    3.6644407422837113
these findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues .    3.189950974575781
as a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated , some caution is warranted .    2.8459753654148128
the established criteria of auditory brainstem responses ( abr ) such as UNK latency , UNK - v interpeak latency and UNK differences of latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present .    3.5417141207328506
this retrospective study compared the abr and pure - tone thresholds in UNK cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies .    3.4550234566932208
the average deficit of the objective abr threshold ( UNK ) to the subjective pure - tone threshold for those frequencies between 1 - 6 khz was 3 . 6 db for the control group ( abr and pure tone thresholds very close ) and 31 . 2 db for the tumor group ( abr threshold much higher than the pure - tone threshold ) .    3.4375591123153972
the association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot , nevus fuscoceruleus , nevus UNK and , with variable frequency , with nevus UNK has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis , a genodermatosis first described by ota and co - workers .    3.0213686236116875
four different combinations have been specified .    3.0605610061127697
most cases are reported from the UNK literature .    4.092697463824822
phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder , but overlapping with other syndromes like UNK - UNK syndrome or UNK - weber syndrome is also possible .    3.6676968601668403
we report a 30 - year - old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back .    2.9294792348301613
orif management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type a3 of the UNK classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments , particularly when only the sliding hip - screw is used for fixation .    3.9611532794602664
a connectable UNK - press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation .    3.5577732739569456
three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed .    3.0782341351119737
the other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred .    2.968295028752297
complaints , leg shortening and changes in the ccd angle were recorded .    3.7140217451720003
furthermore , the mobility score was determined .    2.985891324917632
only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5 ° until the fracture had consolidated .    3.535106504320861
this was due to severe osteopenia and subsequent dislocation of the screw within the femoral head .    3.369441659692596
no pseudarthrosis , osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted .    3.0139158420622065
five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained .    3.69476142974419
on the basis of this review , we recommend the use of this new connectable UNK plate with sliding hip screws because it provides UNK fixation of highly unstable fractures of type a3 .    3.3557156810238395
superficial leptomeningeal hemosiderosis is a rare disease of the central nervous system .    3.4086939257537683
chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of UNK in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue .    3.1781111415474896
there is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve .    2.8130389060727046
accordingly , among a variety of symptoms , cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur .    3.355781331201186
to date , the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural .    2.680109951516375
we present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant .    3.3271636043894963
audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve .    3.200580399730707
these findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion , superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone .    3.147546746729196
thus , patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation .    3.570649158975947
all patients require careful UNK assessment , including UNK stimulation .    3.413309975909266
intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis .    3.561946061671183
although most lesions are initially detected by echocardiography , additional imaging studies , i . e . , magnetic resonance imaging and electron beam computed tomography , are commonly requested .    3.2226311648772494
features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed .    4.026449010425491
for the first time , the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self - experienced neuropsychological deficits for the UNK development of schizophrenia .    3.367406925725449
ninety - six patients with dsm - iii - r diagnoses mainly of the formerly neurotic or personality disordered field , of whom 81 % had shown such basic disorders at the time of the index examination and therefore were classified as persons at high risk of developing schizophrenia , were re - examined for schizophrenia .    3.043937547511815
after an average follow - up period of about 8 years , more than half of the re - examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to dsm - iii - r .    3.094922635497082
the outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77 % of cases by the presence or absence of self - experienced disturbances of perception , thought , speech or action .    3.2812942893952863
to date , at least 12 types of primary dystonia can be distinguished on a genetic basis .    3.3840693198572858
a 3 - bp deletion in the UNK gene causes early onset , generalized torsion dystonia ( td ) , and mutations in the UNK UNK i and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in UNK - responsive dystonia ( UNK ) .    3.9903998319812395
a UNK change in the d2 dopamine receptor in one large family ( UNK ) has recently been implicated in myoclonus - dystonia .    3.4909049072420415
furthermore , seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions , including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype ( UNK ) , one form of focal dystonia ( UNK ) , three types of paroxysmal dystonia ( UNK - 10 ) , x - linked dystonia - parkinsonism ( UNK ) , and rapid - onset dystonia - parkinsonism ( UNK ) .    3.604013700354211
no positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive td ( UNK ) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited td ( UNK ) .    3.1811725177149577
in addition , hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia , metabolic and storage disorders , and various x - linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia .    3.088512445099888
it may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely UNK disorders .    3.2638138635163063
in this study we investigated whether , in conjunction with neuroleptics , a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key - persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2 - year follow - up .    2.896463486155835
this prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients ( according to dsm - iii - r ) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations .    3.133330402607629
patients were examined before , immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention .    3.5272495107828656
patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit .    3.8014235970826715
for patients receiving all three treatment conditions , there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the UNK rate appearing during the second year of the follow - up .    3.5278667954224434
we conclude that in the mid - term , a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their UNK can improve the course of schizophrenic illness .    3.566473637125811
it was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco - specific UNK 4 - ( UNK ) - 1 - ( 3 - UNK ) - 1 - UNK ( UNK ) as well as nicotine and UNK .    3.9376795593375404
recently there has been an increase in the prevalent hiv infected population in germany because of UNK in progression to aids and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant . this increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention .    3.431145808076299
post exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) , defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an hiv infected person by a route through which transmission is possible , is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases .    3.4768216079188625
economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether pep should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for pep should be used for other hiv prevention or treatment interventions . the value of pep depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention .    3.4533363418411347
in this paper , we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of pep in different population subgroups , including those occupationally exposed , those exposed through unprotected sex , and those exposed through iv drug use .    3.01724539204619
the cost - effectiveness of pep is also compared to literature estimates of the cost - effectiveness of other prevention activities .    2.897210055830935
the aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection .    2.658735552304475
of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically .    3.482741493880987
the conversion rate was 14 % ( 13 / 93 ) .    3.468425494146832
a total of 47 patients suffered from cancer .    3.2901847566339613
curative resection was performed in 41 patients ( 87 % ) .    3.8060222400382004
for comparison , 48 patients who underwent open resection were used .    3.8094590440579337
the complication rate was lower after laparoscopy and no reoperation was performed .    2.7460608104198387
patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier .    3.0774442052915747
hospital stay was shorter ( 15 . 3 vs . 8 . 1 days ) , and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced .    4.382007216343105
equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved ; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ .    3.439602441285513
no port metastases were observed .    3.011092725079928
reduced morbidity , reduced hospital stay , reduced abdominal pain , quicker UNK , and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy .    3.7900522132407373
other causes include over - exertion and non - traumatic causes such as acute UNK , drug - induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis .    3.484212983510244
this paper describes the clinical and mr course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle UNK .    3.3047907312091307
each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art .    3.748909590307428
in most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system .    2.6947876377634814
in contrast , neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself .    3.477657431851342
mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions .    3.4401880539973684
the therapeutic regime of nociceptive and neuropathic pain is demonstrated by algorithms of treatment modalities .    2.97030566338872
apart from classic non - opioid analgesics , co - analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well .    3.269023569023324
prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy .    3.3147715219773395
blockades with local anaesthetics as mono - therapy of chronic pain are obsolete .    3.7165596558593865
in posttraumatic pain , however , a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of UNK may be helpful .    3.6376626189012806
the UNK place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain ( smp ) .    2.756823175356716
effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well - being in the elderly were meta - analyzed .    3.363437922001435
psychological well - being was improved and self - rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation .    3.6988446899853233
the mean effect size for other - rated depression reached d = 1 . 15 .    3.174568968049296
whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self - rated well - being or depression , other - rated depression improved less in older samples .    3.093449532586784
high effect sizes derived from control - enhancing interventions and behavior therapy .    3.0531960701011633
sub - analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting .    3.1190212297033284
higher " therapeutic " qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect - sizes too .    3.035024275334911
implications for planning UNK in old age are discussed .    3.528127820012683
the prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma worsens dramatically with the discovery of primary or secondary lymph node metastases .    3.124164117453338
thus consistent prophylaxis and therapy of metastases is indispensable .    3.916672932189764
the standard therapy of manifest cervical lymph node metastases is surgery , if possible using the approach of conservative neck dissection .    3.2391475536965064
in cases of a lymph node stage n3 , i . e .    2.7826938554389296
fixated metastases with a diameter greater than 6 cm , individually adapted therapy in necessary because of the extremely poor prognosis .    3.5562618874405216
objective : the german ophthalmologic society is rising to the challenges of the information age by offering comprehensive information resources online .    2.7263762098808986
human recombinant interleukin 2 ( il - 2 ) , alone or in combination with other cytokines , is currently under investigation for the immunotherapy of metastatic tumours .    3.1459795216029174
objective responses of 20 % - 35 % have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high - dose intravenous il - 2 in combination with interferon - ( ifn ) .    4.186353148378083
however , treatment with il - 2 is complicated by a syndrome of life - threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage , fluid retention , severe hypotension , and ( reversible ) multiple organ dysfunction ( mods ) .    3.4678149029932435
a systemic inflammatory reaction ( sirs ) / sepsis sepsis - like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after il - 2 bolus application alone .    3.5303441659390327
our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high - dose il - 2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with ifn .    3.8351432284498244
we used the international histologic classification set up by the world health organisation in 1992 .    3.005424634194931
the aim of this study was to investigate the differentiation of various types of cyst using an immunohistochemical technique rather than by conventional morphological assessment .    2.6034753300635423
about five per cent of the children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia are asymptomatic during parturition and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period .    2.969208782156224
we report about particularities of " late - UNK " with congenital diaphragmatic hernias namely funnel chest and a fatal outcome of an associated acute gastric volvulus .    2.9707396503791252
the retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients , as established by questionnaire , are reported at 10 + / - 2 years follow - up .    3.4119059332551434
eighty patients could also be reviewed clinically .    3.4756676414303427
some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level .    3.3710402947107747
complications were seen in 72 . 5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis .    3.94319735599676
x - ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients .    3.171229818404237
carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction ( 85 % medial , 5 . 8 % lateral ) were successful in 75 % of cases .    3.7242731201412544
activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in .    3.733822197467968
destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain .    3.5097269803241478
if these problems appear , ( arthroscopic ) resection of the UNK is indicated to interrupt the UNK UNK .    3.7442896886734474
background : with UNK to very early screening it has become necessary to apply laboratory techniques more sensitive and more precise than the formerly used UNK - test to guarantee correct detection of UNK .    3.2490450409407394
three quantitative methods were compared .    3.4379893777361543
the UNK medical school played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional x - rays .    3.571975545238287
famous UNK include e . g . UNK ( 1893 - 1969 ) and l . UNK ( 1910 - 1986 ) .    3.3837473901713238
nowadays conventional x - rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone , but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now .    3.499839778498986
this statement is correct not only for conventional x - rays , but particularly for " poly " - tomography in comparison with ct .    3.2614304119385764
the success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis .    3.5349830159609006
using alternative mechanical techniques , there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty , UNK and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation .    3.567432601349454
additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and / or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis .    3.3405432753214215
a safe closure of a dura lesion is necessary on account of the risk of potentially fatal ( late ) meningitis .    3.473197561491918
161 UNK of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ent - department fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology , operative techniques and results .    3.874796556685198
duraplasty of the UNK was indicated in 70 cases of UNK trauma , 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery , 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations .    4.031610464384685
after an average follow - up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea , UNK treated with antibiotics and meningitis .    3.6149396736561084
as an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated csf - leaks a UNK test was performed in 50 , 9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation .    3.7412946021318105
duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 % .    3.593776687318286
the approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be UNK individually considering size , location and etiology of the dural defect .    3.647633978003507
in the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach .    3.3564309671724075
by use of allogenic tissue , a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained .    3.199591554872599
the UNK is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout .    3.805367804966606
before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about 50 - 60 % of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits .    3.5230141099002306
clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed .    3.290006840757728
however , the presence of degenerative tissues , as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers , may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals .    3.224086712774566
we report on a patient with secondary - probably diuretic - induced - hyperuricaemia and gout UNK in UNK ' s nodes .    3.0949880264618668
hiv - 1 - associated encephalopathy ( hive ) remains an important manifestation of advanced hiv infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy .    3.0562517432887693
this is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system ( cns ) .    2.4655788695294407
hive is characterized by a " subcortical " dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits .    3.97275565112466
an UNK finding are deficits of central motor function .    2.966842253728685
pathogenetically , an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent cns cells is believed to be a requirement .    3.400717962548258
this leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection .    3.185481768548597
hiv - 1 myelopathy ( hivm ) is the other cns manifestion of late hiv infection .    3.189500514876901
the present consensus paper recommends diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in hive and hivm and outlines the current research .    2.857773171212384
background : prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials .    2.7574700704738078
these data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice .    2.891564449552565
forty - nine patients ( mean age , 54 years ) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry .    3.4467816109810556
the mean follow - up was 36 months ( range , 19 - 54 months ) .    2.9631532868298462
the deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure .    2.8991041798547026
using a clinical score , most of the patients had satisfactory results .    3.6758474717842122
the plantar pressure distribution showed significant load UNK of patients with satisfactory results and those with non - satisfactory results .    3.845795658564888
dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait UNK and clinically non - visible gait disorder .    2.9461197125791228
comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of ct scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen .    3.531122323291875
for ebt , dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 UNK .    2.984722265743989
the effective dose for a biphasic investigation ( liver 5 msv , kidney 4 msv ) was below , for a UNK investigation ( liver 7 msv ) above the effective dose of the UNK of the abdomen ( 6 msv ) .    3.3662935225951798
investigation of the abdomen with the ebt should only be performed for certain indications .    3.433171894975329
bone fracture , soft - tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients , and these patients are known to be immunocompromised .    3.778806544016128
to determine this experimentally , closed bone fracture ( right lower leg ) and / or soft - tissue trauma ( 2 . 5 cm midline laparotomy ) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock ( mean arterial bp of 35 + / - 5 mm hg for 90 min ) in male UNK / hen mice .    3.4029358141139765
more significant depression of UNK il - 2 and il - 3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage .    3.356391264234423
the present study suggests that different traumatic insults , i . e . bone fracture as well as soft - tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock , produce comparable depression of host immune function .    3.332373174603418
moreover , combination of closed bone fracture and soft - tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity .    2.9323941980760773
this indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft - tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage .    3.066661040299207
the markedly depressed immune function following bony injury , soft - tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation .    3.2565248658772843
in the management of acute major vessel occlusion , the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) , urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted .    3.0274080608207217
today , the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction , lung embolism , ischaemic stroke , deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs .    3.088259387949499
in view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion , fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach .    3.1241288342106452
basically , it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk .    3.8993566912023256
since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding , the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non - life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion ( crao ) or central retinal vein occlusion ( UNK ) should be based on UNK the risk of adverse events .    3.7134850246802387
furthermore , the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place .    2.9776101014031164
in this article , we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes .    3.4150081402984496
moreover , we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens .    2.9769395337107185
furthermore , we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt - pa in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion .    3.416505887237458
in light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem , we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion .    3.5055470654960055
although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution , we believe that the administration of low - dose rt - pa ( 50 mg ) in a UNK manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt - pa and intravenous heparin ) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion ( crao ) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion ( rvo ) , recent onset of symptoms ( crao < = 12 h , rvo < = 11 d ) and severe visual loss ( < = 20 / 50 ) .    3.3862090142389083
because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy , only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment .    3.4630239183892844
in view of the poor visual and ocular prognosis in severe retinal vessel occlusion , controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of thrombolysis in the management of this disease .    3.2669032975585908
this study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol ( 18 mg / kg - h ) .    3.286748197777244
the object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by hrt .    2.8198975723598783
objective : this study was designed to investigate the differences between tiva with propofol / remifentanil ( p / r ) and balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane / fentanyl ( s / f ) in gynaecological laparoscopic surgery .    3.148807926848373
emphasis was put on haemodynamic reaction , recovery profile , postoperative side effects and patient satisfaction .    3.5975895362715375
confluent and UNK papillomatosis ( crp ) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology .    3.481933000173938
recent electron microscopic studies suggest that crp is a disorder of UNK .    3.4531501943209024
in our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings .    3.0618241283500023
crp is generally resistant to therapy .    3.602602517454721
we treated a 19 - year - old patient with typical crp with oral minocycline .    2.7777605374176884
within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely .    2.880095996806379
twelve months after UNK of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence .    3.5008973188333776
in crp minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects .    3.162035012883129
wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty .    3.4546395765345363
this prospective , randomized and double - blinded pilot - study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient UNK analgesia .    3.2543697819884665
the recommended infusion time for i . v .    2.850390184179551
prostaglandin e 1 ( pge1 ) therapy is 2 or 3 h , depending on the dose .    3.7456458011823033
the aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate , for the first time , whether the dose of 60 µg pge1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times .    3.3052106572902473
a total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain - free walking distance between 50 and 200 m ( 3 km / h , 12 % ) were randomized to receive an i . v .    2.9979357954507937
infusion of 3 ampoules UNK ( 60 µg pge1 ) administered for either 1 or 2 h , once a day for 4 weeks .    3.197667273384402
primary variables were pain - free walking distance as well as safety , determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure .    4.222938211092155
the efficacy was comparable in the two groups .    2.8045725454768573
in the 1 - h infusion group , the pain - free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m , and in the 2 - h group from 88 to 147 m , while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to UNK m , respectively .    3.1649726753111334
the differences between the two groups were not significant , although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain - free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2 - h pge1 infusion ( increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m ) .    3.047910977594053
course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups .    3.316190103858044
altogether , in intermittent claudication both the 1 - h and the 2 - h pge1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety .    3.316112459403455
patients with an initial pain - free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2 - h pge1 infusion .    2.858421333892656
the problem in the treatment of deep hyalin cartilage defects is due to the minimal regeneration potential of this specific tissue .    3.8273879145969554
several attempts were made to solve this difficulties experimentally and clinically .    3.0111171521184237
the proliferative potential of autogenous perichondrium / periost is well - known for decades .    3.2935739672833355
gender identity change in UNK patients is rare .    3.912764895915587
we report on the transsexual development of a patient with male UNK .    3.4420918450500118
the case report emphasizes the importance of a thorough differential diagnosis .    3.2330596028166205
fractionated irradiation with x - rays or UNK is an important therapeutic option in the palliative treatment of kaposi ' s sarcoma .    3.293613393099094
we report on three hiv patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field .    2.578832345157684
three UNK men ( age 45 - 60 y ) stage of disease cdc UNK , were treated with fractionated soft x - rays with the scheme conventionally used by us ( total dose 30 gy , single doses 3 gy ) .    3.378825241870937
immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field , resolving after 2 - 4 weeks , leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation .    3.1373537579553807
the cause of this rare reaction to soft x - ray therapy , potentially suggesting an individually altered radiation sensitivity , is so far unknown .    3.2408338575683295
controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue .    3.0649999268093904
due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine , microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years .    3.9926787046621537
this article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior - anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis , degenerative instability ; failed back surgery syndrome , fractures etc .    2.7575291644842825
the lumbar segments l 2 - 5 are approached through a blunt muscle - splitting retroperitoneal technique .    3.1480878922218762
the antero - lateral circumference of the motion segment is exposed with a frame - type retractor which is anchored in the adjacent vertebral bodies with anchoring screws .    2.8384929602627618
the lumbosacral junction is exposed via a mini - laparotomy using a special soft tissue UNK .    3.020244467271788
interbody fusion is described with UNK bone grafts .    3.7977178100525197
preliminary experience with 83 patients treated between 1995 and 1996 show that peri - and postoperative morbidity is low .    3.3844812611008117
clinical as well as radiological results are comparable to the standard techniques .    4.196649737922416
spectrum as well as rate of complications so far do not differ from those described in the literature for non - microsurgical approaches .    4.184134424423609
the posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint .    3.5890492284384083
the posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles .    2.731573623101225
from a functional point of view , one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur .    2.8759659143574146
the anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone .    3.1178780997880273
these fibers become tense when the knee is flexed .    2.4023024302218468
the posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended .    2.795062085365066
the main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type i collagen positive dense connective tissue .    3.2273032882806385
the longitudinal fibrils of type i collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type iii collagen positive fibrils .    2.941783669136188
in the center of the middle third region , the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament .    3.054968927769164
in this region , the structure of the tissue UNK fibrocartilage .    3.187906189514198
oval - shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils .    3.0486766055390073
the femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral UNK UNK .    3.4715086631183314
near the anchoring region at the femur and tibia there should be various UNK which might have an important function for the UNK of the knee joint .    3.7064841282936483
the blood supply of the pcl arises from the middle geniculate artery .    3.0017701375615924
the ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a UNK network .    3.3491794318100427
from the synovial sheath , the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network .    2.5384789946207187
the distribution of blood vessels within the pcl is not homogeneous .    2.9343427439737595
we detected three avascular areas within the ligament : both fibrocartilaginous UNK of the pcl are devoid of blood vessels .    3.4586416048417323
a third avascular zone is located in the central zone of fibrocartilage of the middle third region .    3.189106155155053
atrial reentrant tachycardias ( art ) are a potentially life - threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery .    3.1897260487152583
from july 1993 to december 1997 , temporary transesophageal pacing was used to UNK 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients .    2.9824510476908377
at the time of the first tachycardia episode , patients ' ages were 1 month to 26 years ( mean 9 . 8 yrs ) .    3.1002672588790516
time from operation to onset of first tachycardia episode ranged from 1 day to 19 years .    3.1322457529802508
onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients ( 1 to 19 years after operation ) .    3.899703436627069
postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts ; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication .    3.286949900531241
after UNK a UNK transesophageal catheter , atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed .    2.8671868339026694
atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160 - 380 ms with 1 : 1 to 4 : 1 av conduction .    3.1183630033346903
temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 UNK ( 20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia ) .    2.7920851332166507
tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases ( 93 % ) without complications .    3.2217303185538135
in 3 cases , conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg / kg i . v .    2.840620457001559
after tachycardia conversion , sinus - or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases .    3.3180464212255454
in 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded ; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min ( 7 cases ) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion ( 2 cases ) .    3.2435374541140365
in conclusion , transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective , relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease .    2.8838292251873465
after UNK the components and theory of neuroticism ( n ) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases , comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome ( fms ) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism .    3.037257382789043
fms and pain patients score high on depression , anxiety , and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease .    3.168854009717285
high subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high n subjects and fms patients .    3.0807692352509646
on the endocrinological level cortisol responses to challenge tests with crh as well as prolactin responses to UNK are higher in fms patients than in high n healthy subjects indicating an endocrinological difference .    3.2567614041171615
a common feature , however , is the lack of UNK in the two groups , since UNK are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other ( UNK - sleeping , working - UNK ) , to re - adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses , or to adjust to conditions of shift work .    3.9521582457009505
this is reflected by UNK disturbances in fms patients and could also explain their UNK of pain perception , because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain - producing muscle tension .    3.0134209213923904
purpose : to document our experience with spiral UNK - ct of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate , differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on UNK consecutive patients .    3.5628506319877076
since the publication of a case of syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in UNK the discussion about transfusion - associated bacterial infection is ongoing .    3.6514132467125435
for some time , virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted .    3.0008383302348984
however , in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria .    3.3459957335770714
in this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion - associated microbial infections is outlined .    2.844688522197008
the bacteria involved are discussed .    3.237792471827233
furthermore , the state of the art for prevention and diagnosis as well as the methods for inactivation of bacteria are assessed .    3.167541643205839
while working to develop a distal locking device , we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic - morphometric investigation .    3.226260514609255
the amount and the direction of implant deformation in UNK UNK UNK unreamed tibial nails ( synthes ) were analyzed .    3.320309645155783
measurement of implant deformation ( 3 translations , 3 angles ) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3d magnetic motion UNK system before and after nail insertion .    3.6100180906799806
unreamed tibial nails ( diameter 8 mm , n = 10 ; diameter 9 mm , n = 10 ) were inserted in paired human cadaver tibiae .    3.3241234639713486
the results showed lateral translations of - 4 . 5 + / - 3 . 5 mm ( mean and standard deviation , range 14 . 3 mm ) and dorsal translations of - 7 . 8 + / - 5 . 8 mm ( mean and standard deviation , range 19 . 2 mm ) .    3.1112718566908972
rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0 . 3 + / - 0 . 7 ° ( mean and standard deviation , range 2 . 4 ° ) .    3.652575937067864
the results showed , that a simple aiming arm , mounted on the proximal nail end , alone or even in combination with a large working channel ( e . g .    2.9346304681229802
10 mm in diameter ) , was not adequate to the aiming process .    3.6256232199057816
a radiographic - morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental ( n = 20 ) or clinical ( n = 20 ) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter .    3.144809700154337
these measurements showed a relatively constant distance between the upper distal transverse hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia ( average 12 . 3 mm and only a narrow range ( 7 . 6 mm ) .    3.314031082097649
these data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that UNK the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia .    3.150629160119648
the goal of the interdisciplinary longitudinal study of aging ( ilse ) is to assess healthy and satisfying aging in middle adulthood and later life .    2.531159057136332
in addition , this study compares adults from eastern and western germany .    2.854309090043201
the data for this study were collected between late 1993 and early 1996 as part of the first measurement point of the ilse .    3.8892618212853054
five - hundred and one participants from the leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the heidelberg area on four specific dimensions : personality , cognitive functioning , subjective well - being , and health .    2.9936141828476566
age differences were obtained for neuroticism , UNK , openness , and UNK .    4.322610192924113
differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health .    3.1182223436246286
regional differences between eastern and western germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism , openness and UNK , as well as in subjective well - being .    3.2527551542772613
significant age by region interactions were obtained for openness and some of the cognitive measures , as well as for the physicians ' health ratings of the participants , suggesting selective historical effects .    3.3244737226341203
the results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife , as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west .    3.3349772092752703
modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and , at the same time , UNK the general desire of women for natural birth .    3.3295666771189367
standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks , allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications .    3.595799791310677
a considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical - technical image associated with modern obstetrics .    3.1816866264153316
the benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application .    3.1299229984732886
there is good scientific proof that routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring during labor and delivery is associated with an increase in the rate of cesarean sections as well as operative vaginal deliveries without any clear benefit to the newborn in terms of a decrease in mortality or morbidity .    3.5073122008650985
in a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies , the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta - analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events .    3.1059085761717573
in high - risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in UNK and mortality of the baby .    3.4351650892543955
with careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and UNK during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance .    3.460235724534233
we report the history of a 38 year old patient who began to develop mental deterioration at the age of 26 .    3.7911441699880237
after a time of 7 years neurological signs like writing dystonia occured .    3.189833737720566
UNK - UNK - desease ( hsd ) was diagnosed at the age of 36 in vivo with the clinical presentation of severe dystonia , rigidity , dementia , and typical signal loss in the globus - pallidus the reticular part of the substantia nigra , and the nucleus ruber in the t - 2 weighted mri .    3.544304908676472
the " eye - of - the - UNK " - sign , a bilateral UNK in the rostral globus pallidus , was not observed in follow - up examinations .    3.9107955413069915
hsd is a rare autosomal - recessive or sporadic disease of unknown etiology .    3.619896134668114
in one third of the patients a dementing process is the first clinical sign of the disorder , and is a rare differential diagnosis of early onset dementia .    4.906725171264648
in 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence ( cvi ) caused by primary UNK or postthrombotic syndrome stage i - iii ( according to widmer ) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented .    3.3867763877912376
during the training UNK there was an improvement in subjective complains such as pain and tendency for edema in the legs .    3.0972252960307203
mobility in the upper ankle joint was improved UNK as venous drainage function .    3.7949165838265086
clinical benefit was achieved in the reduction of ulcer size ; 7 of 10 ulcers completely healed .    3.4917095863647902
costs are covered by the patient ' s health insurance company in germany , as long as the exercise training is medically supervised .    3.808351066679969
epileptic seizures may alter autonomic functions .    3.3862563456159696
this is especially the case with complex focal seizures ( of temporal lobe origin ) and UNK mal .    3.4905458755935537
most frequently , such seizures cause ictal tachycardia , sometimes tachypnea , probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures .    2.829705524638451
ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena .    3.4048441990635454
however , they may be life threatening .    3.4397341597884097
their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal eeg and ecg registration .    3.656417321867396
postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure .    3.1095733425581753
however , a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope .    2.6553114006417067
treatment of such epileptic seizures includes an optimization of UNK drug therapy and the implantation of a cardiac demand stimulator .    3.5431987014342545
there is growing evidence that ictal asystole is a cofactor in sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients .    2.7740672716175996
a minimal documentation system ( UNK ) has been developed for self - assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patients on palliative care units .    3.9574426722625473
to decrease the administrative burden and thereby increase the acceptance of the system an electronic database was developed to facilitate data entry and documentation .    3.3089433697449318
background : hearing loss can be found in more than 50 % of children with down syndrome .    3.175174454248552
chronic or recurrent middle - ear effusions are considered the most frequent etiology with an incidence of 60 % .    3.5079016287518727
microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare UNK cutaneous neoplasm characterised by slow but locally aggressive growth .    3.461097041688586
its histogenesis and nomenclature are still a subject of controversy .    3.099596023082124
under - recognition and the tumour ' s bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses .    2.7889036976775063
in addition , subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence .    2.976401698768409
thus , the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal .    2.9899860620574965
we report the case of an 81 - year - old woman with a microcystic adnexal carcinoma of the lower lip , which was treated by micrographic surgery .    3.2165561324253096
on the basis of this case , differential diagnoses , histogenesis and micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice are discussed .    3.3071218102647704
in old age , UNK processes also simultaneously effect the opportunity and necessity to shape one ' s life .    3.2635427140541
societal orientation UNK , and the UNK of earlier times disappear .    4.854099820418853
UNK and option appear as an increasing UNK challenge to coping with life .    3.0487625332015518
these ambiguities characterize modern old age .    3.0345437809295803
or in other words : the UNK of old age has begun .    4.5421313999005655
posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) is associated with a poor outcome .    3.266813642837725
when evaluating the literature according to the utstein method , there were only 2 survivors ( 0 . 18 % ) out of 1 , 135 cpr attempts after trauma ( table 1 ) .    3.6438957952448336
differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician - staffed prehospital trauma care system in cologne .    3.4530671280986764
from january 1987 to december 1990 , a total of 49 , UNK emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol .    3.161727827488363
among 9 , UNK trauma - related calls , UNK patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team , UNK of these were pronounced dead .    4.0594319100206695
cpr was initiated in the remaining 224 patients , who comprise the study population ( defined as 100 % ) .    3.6002532976880146
all patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol .    3.4282987502898874
cpr in the field was successful in 68 ( 30 . 4 % ) patients , who were then admitted to a hospital ; 42 of these died within the first 24 h . four patients ( 1 . 8 % ) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later , 1 with a lasting neurological deficit ( fig .    3.8990114761259074
in 156 ( 69 . 6 % ) cases resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful in the field .    3.6526347918727677
even in a physician - staffed prehospital trauma care system , the chance of surviving a post - traumatic cardiac arrest is minimal .    2.885437549370671
survival has to be regarded as an individual fate ; the overall results are UNK .    3.730495216276257
even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic cpr ever published , prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors .    3.4718104741684885
nevertheless , the result does not justify general omission of cpr after trauma as : ( 1 ) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far ; and ( 2 ) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic cpr .    3.1926872103058357
functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the UNK or to UNK sphincter function during micturition .    4.507971098943088
therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both .    3.010209833517861
in a brief survey mechanical , UNK , UNK , and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined .    4.350665663071558
conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed .    3.7071881151120865
depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease , a combined therapy can be useful .    4.057069470803537
in the case of resistance to therapy , intermittent UNK is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter .    3.3482812511352624
during long - term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol ( 300 mg / d ) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare .    3.357116855681387
the diagnoses were confirmed by histology ; concomitant diseases , especially diabetes mellitus , were not detectable .    3.3593901703061078
following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy , cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse .    2.878946244922195
the clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare .    2.847311901859704
for this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol .    4.175982495486411
this should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare .    2.7039741382468963
background : aim of the present prospective longitudinal study was the statistical foundation and thus further replication of recent findings of UNK [ 13 ] , who postulated a significant importance of specific , within the psychological pain research long neglected pain coping strategies as risk factors concerning pain chronification : UNK to " UNK it out " on the cognitive level and endurance strategies on the behavioural level .    3.1032993620599156
intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia a or b .    3.4101168775274027
the most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints , elbows and UNK joints .    2.8174282660118295
resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis .    3.2778322774445217
hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings .    3.939424436097064
these early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage , finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint .    3.5045367273149353
since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia a or b were treated at the center for hemophilic disorders frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach .    2.9953803646539385
minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution , temporarily non - weight bearing of the extremity , application of ice - UNK and physical therapy .    3.568485196946387
more severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis .    3.9662517771857924
this is followed by a consequent physical therapy ( joint and soft tissue techniques ) and anti - inflammatory drugs .    2.937431969053155
the goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint , the improvement of the coordination , and the proprioception .    4.355383284118468
the chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions .    3.02790170559304
local ice application , UNK and local anti - inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy .    3.7357662826619866
soft heel shock UNK , elastic and semi - rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement .    2.754688539650772
synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis .    3.9937694411251
UNK ( UNK ) , which is an alternative in certain cases , has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital .    4.119803647663434
in advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy .    3.355425346015726
bandages , crutches and UNK shoe devices improve the walking capacity .    3.110225762771166
over an 18 - month period findings of stress x - ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications , results and therapeutic consequences .    3.299863086480871
the analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress x - ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs .    3.407527115650557
the introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions .    2.8063565762223397
a 72 - year - old patient received 0 . 1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and UNK . 5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy .    3.92773988744829
severe respiratory depression and somnolence UNK 3 . 5 h later , which lasted over the next 24 h and necessitated intubation and mechanical ventilation .    3.5001600590860074
continuous administration of > 6 mg UNK to UNK the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect .    3.9209666376515164
the patient ' s condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0 . 3 mg UNK was administered .    3.3822368881409557
for the time being , especially in the case of elderly patients , we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0 . 1 mg morphine is given .    3.4972965839596917
respiration should be monitored for quite some time .    3.6790571733735393
in contrast to the often debated nyha classification , the determination of peak oxygen uptake ( peak vo2 ) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure ( chf ) .    3.181119880775315
however , cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool , which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell .    2.9515337180852277
exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test .    3.5773827914044816
this test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a UNK level within 6 minutes .    3.1855982433237413
the 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test , which is associated with much smaller UNK in heart rate , blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing .    3.3624038375563954
it is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance .    2.9476928132356974
furthermore , it can be easily performed and , due to low logistic and personal requirements , it is very cost effective .    4.0159144911256295
the results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by UNK exercise - limiting disorders , such as pulmonary diseases .    3.150980895814731
independent from the etiology of chf , the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak vo2 .    3.5531742778792044
in serial exercise testing the distance covered within 6 minutes allow to predict the individual peak vo2 .    3.126580463908325
like peak vo2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in chf , with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters .    3.17553675694235
in chf patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one - year - mortality of up to 50 % , whereas the one - year - mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent .    4.061325368260593
in addition , the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance > = 450 m . like cardiopulmonary exercise testing , the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease .    2.7866655166464156
the 6 minute walk test is , thus , a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in chf patients .    3.0897603416830806
however , neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients , e . g . , for cardiac transplantation , as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters .    3.2181862847047644
we report the first case of prurigo UNK in the german literature .    3.228233910708455
for over a year , a 16 - year old white girl developed an UNK pruritic symmetrical reticular , papulo - UNK eruption on the trunk , UNK and pubic region .    3.604360134662665
histologically a superficial perivascular UNK and lichenoid inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed .    2.8895615624846447
topical corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines had no effect .    2.929138584290199
systemic corticosteroids and UNK ( dadps ) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences .    3.4948653186259295
healing occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic - minocycline .    3.358526983106041
following parenteral administration , clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels .    2.9620127820589155
therefore , we studied the UNK ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo - facial surgery .    3.8158392729534563
the effects of glycerol are discussed in detail .    2.9785656037003676
glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states .    3.0062281404927838
especially if applied in oil / water - emulsions it improves , the hydration of the horny layers better than urea .    2.9643604385153117
in addition , if facilitates the UNK of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation .    3.2480794994502706
furthermore , by using glycerol , the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced ; long term used leads to increased elasticity .    3.3598751821665376
the roughness of the horny layer is reduced , which can be explained by the UNK and / or the UNK effect .    4.501687963802706
glycerol used in o / w - emulsions also UNK against the influence of UNK or noxious lipophilic agents .    3.5529130327971443
presumably a flux from the base of the epidermis towards its surface triggers the regeneration of the barrier .    3.2643093236504566
finally , glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration , as has been proven for UNK .    3.2633608060365846
background : an 18 - year - old woman presented with UNK symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus .    2.959803391573502
she complained of diplopia on lateral UNK .    3.0346116531387
laboratory investigations confirmed grave ' s disease with UNK and UNK receptor antibodies .    4.636563445341419
atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients .    3.6231769623776047
internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non - pharmacological treatment option .    3.622198573854167
cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process .    4.000030351764159
recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave UNK .    2.7131691942006597
thus , mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation .    3.2877654416566933
further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation .    2.6825282453906114
UNK non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow , typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia , proteinuria , anemia and hypercalcemia .    3.3545213519977954
in its progress , deposits of amyloids in almost all organs can be observed .    3.0293236654434463
however , UNK which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare .    2.9902324161640434
this case report presents a 61 - year - old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations .    3.3004163430067215
a biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light - chain type , which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with UNK light - chains stage ii after UNK and salmon .    3.4803076293468265
in the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro - enteric system .    2.914891640438351
macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature .    3.517160617142256
however , reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known .    3.1562272064696386
aim : improved detection of pulmonary - venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay .    3.0344838791643602
for the histological verification of suspicious non - palpable small breast tumors , the three - dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the abbi system is the optimal solution at present .    2.936295228969518
because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation , errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided .    3.0512307236754044
taking the three UNK leading symptoms into consideration - suspicious microcalcification , focal shadow and structural irregularity - it can be stated that the digital mammography of the abbi system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification , but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique .    2.686380264783555
these structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography .    3.110322021356502
after the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation , residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor UNK reach the excision margin ( r1 resection ) .    3.0287315564304262
thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the abbi system .    2.959039384668246
in 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in - breast recurrence , 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed .    3.1330761573448336
in 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas , breast - conserving therapy was indicated .    3.1927487897984994
two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied ( minimal tumor - free margin > 2 mm , no extensive intraductal component ) to use the abbi cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow .    3.2168465623275004
with the increasing number of patients surviving after therapeutic intervention for congenital heart disease ( chd ) , accurate and frequent follow - up of their morphologic and functional cardiovascular status is required , preferably with a noninvasive imaging technique .    3.1378884882291227
in a UNK multicenter study we followed - up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years ( 1 . 5 - 15 years ) for 4 . 8 years ( 0 . 5 - 20 . 0 years ) .    3.956740742987999
it is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome , like age at injury , type of fracture , interval between injury and treatment , method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing .    3.0357207894189906
at follow - up subjective parameters ( pain , weather UNK ) , clinical parameters ( range of motion , claudication , leg length discrepancies ) and radiological parameters ( hip series ) were investigated and medical charts and UNK were reviewed using a standardized protocol .    3.7666076406337408
29 of 30 children ( 96 . 7 % ) have sustained displaced fractures .    3.314936886704282
non - operative treatment has been applied in 4 children .    3.587442402779849
26 femoral neck fractures ( type i : 1 , type ii : 8 , type iii : 17 ) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and / or pins .    4.002634185883035
following operative treatment 9 of 26 children ( 34 . 6 % ) UNK a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children ( 11 . 5 % ) suffered a coxa vara .    3.6738722470934837
in 6 of 26 children ( 23 % ) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm .    3.1600612829995396
we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow - up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type ii or type iii fractures , or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years , or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident .    3.072178832353262
we observed no significant follow - up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing .    2.8389023064369825
operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children .    3.6177400348591675
however , in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow - up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation ( interval injury - operation < 6 hours ) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury .    2.941204515865932
evidence based standards for structure quality in out - patient management of chronic pain states do not exist .    3.191384505671148
therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain .    3.3645538793829917
objective : the aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver - venous oxygen saturation , oxygen delivery and - demand , liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects in the reperfusion period during a UNK operation with occlusion of the liver UNK .    3.190317725794105
facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents .    3.0950485270408348
due to this main etiologic factor , trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries , commonly involving the brain , chest or abdomen .    3.0774496981328268
as a consequence , the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life - threatening injuries , including the maintenance of the airways .    3.5907876591934733
patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone .    2.990590504891184
in many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures .    2.7992159383670714
a complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods .    3.285130497513994
a series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography ( ct ) .    3.5427223072893277
in trauma patients ct is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality .    3.285786309212538
ct UNK soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies .    3.1859473777448826
a complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological ( ct ) evaluation .    3.4825525747656805
on the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds , surgery rates and small - area variations within the catchment area of the aok magdeburg were examined for the year 1997 .    3.039805544392603
substantial variation can be constantly seen .    3.0889834583203792
the UNK quotient at the 30 most frequent UNK groups ranged from 2 to 5 .    3.0383007264119186
generally , the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute .    3.237242197944952
correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors .    2.940436678099403
the extent of the small - area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates .    3.193352193859669
criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit .    3.7904545324902927
between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force " advisory committee to the german federal health office in matters of approval and review of existing UNK b3 - psychiatry , neurology , anesthesiology " analyzed and evaluated the cns - active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration .    2.7504550636514518
the evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the UNK .    3.1596323822620245
reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds .    3.962709103499544
one hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published .    2.9569984858957628
" negative " indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee .    3.258290535376703
it is UNK that the federal health UNK did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date .    2.8138419500082943
the process of the " UNK " was stopped abruptly by the 5th UNK of the german drug law in august 1994 , - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country .    3.803113464552916
background : we attempted to illustrate connections between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation course in patients after cataract operations .    3.1090919810091013
without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn .    3.2675925728054382
only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published .    2.9617223624953537
a critical review of these studies and some case reports , in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis , does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations .    3.603833998392151
a 36 - years - old woman presented a UNK in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x - ray .    3.668293725382789
the biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on .    4.205421458409168
the surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells , focal recent and older hemorrhages , rests of fibrinous UNK and dystrophic calcifications .    2.6612997655055377
in the surrounding tissue there were pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls , this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change .    3.114508541033807
a UNK virus infection was also found .    3.2192280450025024
in aortic atresia , coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta .    2.9630678179326653
we report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia .    2.1582041033467667
in one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( aortic atresia , severe mitral stenosis ) , an intact interatrial septum / premature closure of the foramen ovale was found .    2.893761902998279
while no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found , echocardiography , angiography and the post - mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation .    3.0289831999218504
in a second patient with complex congenital heart disease , including aortic atresia , antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary UNK .    3.041087998866706
this report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary - UNK ( sinusoids ) and coronary arterio - venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia .    2.735564395039728
the introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care UNK .    2.9725716181936384
however , methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported .    2.813251742169647
with the advent of a new biosensor ( UNK diagnostics ) and a revised UNK biomedical device , accuracy was expected to be improved .    3.16487092392971
the goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods .    3.2686534424419227
the combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three - dimensional bone architecture .    3.0777416806957145
microcomputed tomography avoids the time - consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections .    3.3051001127831583
furthermore , its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm .    3.0141127045921894
thus , three - dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone .    3.2964992855126156
the aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion , which does not occur frequently .    3.3265225085053527
every site of the skeleton may be involved .    3.6992331979669575
although it can be observed at any age , it distinctly UNK from 10 to 20 years of age .    3.3989194303412242
distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist .    3.1337792525789765
since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton , a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction .    3.2516569320074757
in the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts , thereof 5 latent , 31 active , and 5 aggressive lesions , were investigated .    3.0145953526621003
while morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions , a recurrence rate of 19 . 5 % had to be observed in our series .    4.090114120844028
taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion , analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients .    3.5333680425328318
since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical UNK , therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage - dependent surgical procedures .    3.2877840132640737
the UNK syndrome ( remitting UNK symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema ) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis .    3.4060724391943795
it usually presents as an acute , symmetric UNK with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet .    2.724828160087927
anti - inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement .    3.042547067359798
we describe the case of an 81 year old man with a primarily unilateral manifestation involving the right hand .    2.9321611539587167
a thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected .    3.7107376117634034
within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand .    2.9961385492298835
movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful .    3.5843729070159864
low - dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms .    3.6868011781655863
the objective of this study was to determine the usefulness , safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port - catheter - systems ( UNK ) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver .    3.319016232444828
our objectives were to demonstrate risk - factor modification and increased work - load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long - term effects , 6 months ( n = 59 ) and 12 months ( n = 30 ) after termination of the program .    3.960683327690431
we observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re - integrated after completion of phase ii rehabilitation .    3.652455555131462
here , we present the so - called " UNK retractor " , which can be fixed on to the operating table .    3.6680917736668848
it allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound , both in upper and lower abdominal interventions .    3.0111783215202768
in this way , as shown by our recent experience , we gain an optimal view of the UNK area and into the small pelvis .    3.661081898655972
the disaster management in germany is UNK in the constitution .    4.584577854117598
according to the german constitution the UNK of the interior of the federal states UNK the disaster management by UNK it to the city and county administrations .    3.2985381198050465
these elaborate and update a special disaster management UNK , which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends .    3.361664988405883
the american - european consensus conference recently recommended the following criteria for diagnosis of ards : ( 1 ) acute onset ; ( 2 ) pao2 / fio2 < = 200 mmhg regardless of peep level ; ( 3 ) bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph ; ( 4 ) UNK < = 18 mmhg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension .    3.092188490328894
pathophysiologically , ards is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary - alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure .    3.474616079293808
hypoxemia is caused by intrapulmonary right - to - left shunting due to to persistent perfusion of non - ventilated alveoli .    3.477438811401395
another characteristic feature in ards is the low UNK compliance .    3.3410277124947325
latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3 - 10 cases / 100 , 000 inhabitants / year .    3.978453824726833
mortality rates are a major concern : old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50 - 60 % .    3.3198502759259316
thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end - stage cardiac and pulmonary failure .    3.2501147871567317
meanwhile more than 50 . 000 heart , 2500 heart - lung and 10 . 000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide .    3.553876484133254
improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1 - year survival rates of 70 - 90 % .    4.18182797425156
long - term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease , bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies .    3.4318229017064987
furthermore , indications and results of different UNK will be presented and new developments discussed .    3.920006391838594
the paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in germany in the second half of the 20th century .    3.550179564148912
it analyzes scientific and public UNK on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine .    3.7334707243818523
the paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death .    3.1302395752710606
it will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public , introduced into clinical routine , and implemented through medical and legal UNK .    3.2260387113855624
finally , it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years .    3.0237653232354527
an understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists , UNK , UNK , and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late - modern societies .    3.9676950369497113
background : in the course of graves ' disease ( gd ) the UNK muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage .    3.216415759055243
differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy .    4.2746450189487435
injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today .    4.070384091639678
when the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries , that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis , is increased threefold .    3.3469516212890786
the lethality , the overall gravity of the injuries , the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased .    3.5607325494210533
even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved , long - term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological UNK frequently persist .    3.6796272452584153
complicated pelvic injuries , i . e . pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture ( floating hip ) are special cases .    3.237255542534899
even when these priorities are correctly observed , the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft - tissue damage .    3.212152882224826
acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures .    3.5268554748109966
in addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned , such fracture - specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall , comminuted fractures , joint depression fractures and intra - articular fragments increasingly play a part .    3.535586872513878
the long - term result worsens with increasing number of these additional pathologies .    3.5027439324328413
two - dimensional conventional x - rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations .    3.812983730815351
the ability to UNK ct scans into three - dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations .    3.7058002028587462
cephalometric evaluation with UNK provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts , enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject , at any given time and in relation to the normal .    3.3195057868149878
the purpose of this study was to check the precision of the dräger vaporizer model 19 . 3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane .    2.732704635765696
background : since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in germany , tumor - pain - prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival .    4.061632211135454
knowing that about 50 % of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day , the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients ' days with tumor - caused pain per year ( 82 . 710 . UNK days in germany 1995 ) .    3.3492466642354923
by division with UNK ( days ) , it is calculated that 226 . UNK patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in germany .    3.683727757459798
another calculation based on UNK ' s publications that 60 - 90 % of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989 / 90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221 . UNK .    3.6851219763968794
laser catheters which run UNK on a guide wire were developed for UNK of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty ( elca ) .    3.1918922662665428
we investigated the safety and efficacy of elca with these new catheters plus ptca in patients with UNK or occlusions in coronary stents .    3.417732303102515
the age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with UNK instrumentation ( hi ) .    3.090022263757588
with hi , satisfactory long - term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 % , but without UNK UNK capabilities . the distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine ( flat back ) , which is biomechanically disadvantageous .    4.0161308699525575
the newer UNK attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage .    2.86780620368109
the first prototypes of these systems were UNK - ( UNK ) and UNK - UNK instrumentation .    4.25722757635332
ideal indications for posterior instrumented curve correction are structural idiopathic double major curves and flexible single curves .    2.9564917358449367
however , even with these newer UNK systems derotation is low , because derotation is , without any doubt , related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection .    3.1784249045076094
UNK syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic UNK and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize .    3.3010349575715034
the surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult , especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base .    3.1163123337088243
angioplasty and stent implantation may offer an alternative to standard surgical procedures in the treatment of carotid stenoses in the future .    4.087410279164532
however , the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation .    3.0332699510409338
the application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers .    3.044812826363829
we discuss the case of a 78 - year - old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side .    3.023152884296345
after the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy , we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open stent implantation .    3.993004843198289
the periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as koenen tumors .    2.602003650900874
UNK UNK UNK koenen was born on march 10 , 1893 , in UNK and died in bois - le - UNK may 29 , UNK .    3.232311084812039
from 1910 to UNK he studied medicine at the university of amsterdam .    3.2730491148181233
in UNK he published his publication concerning a family with tuberous sclerosis in which UNK of periungual fibromas are shown .    2.9268698567728726
his thesis in 1933 at the university in UNK was UNK " UNK in children .    3.7631514290941994
its importance in UNK and social regard , by reason of an investigation in some UNK in UNK - UNK " .    4.527388539742303
later he was UNK director of a state mental institution .    3.239589157829204
the periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by UNK UNK in munich in UNK .    3.2033879847863798
parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures , new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996 .    3.345916237691942
we have studied the architecture , surface - morphology , and shape - conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems .    2.764254644460785
the objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process , UNK restenosis , and stent thrombosis .    3.031788749527589
using electron microscopy we found UNK surfaces on 5 stents .    2.851220788548414
all other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp - UNK surface irregularities .    2.9150436911576927
video - based morphometry showed covering between 8 . 3 % and 26 . 4 % .    3.359672027124756
stent shortening after in - vitro expansion ranged from 0 % up to 10 . 5 % of the initial stent length .    4.454840354078677
in some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over - expansion of the stent UNK .    2.927576975242672
this over - expansion mounted up to 20 % of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather UNK than homogenous expansion pattern .    3.443089574508275
unilateral hearing loss ( hl ) caused by an acoustic neuroma ( an ) is regarded to be neural ( " non - cochlear " ) .    3.3063900593822373
by using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory ( cochlear ) hl .    2.8294257083244636
we prefer distortion - product otoacoustic emissions ( dpoae ) because these are more frequency - specific and stable .    2.658821021949889
pure - tone audiometry , dp - grams , brainstem - evoked response audiometry ( bera ) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases , while special auditory tests ( UNK , UNK ) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases .    3.4054437842646514
bera was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case .    3.262404195786446
after comparing UNK and dp - grams we found 13 patients with sensory hl , 4 patients with combined sensorineural hl and 7 patients with neural hl .    3.2477241410120374
there was a strong correlation between the results of dpoae and the results of special auditory test ( = 0 . 63 ) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function .    4.187988385573936
the result showed that the typical hl caused by an was a combined sensorineural loss .    3.508487008629862
the monoclonal dominant malignant t cells in mycosis UNK ( mf ) carry identical tcr rearrangements .    2.957866753831095
their detection is a useful diagnostic tool .    3.405393242081507
thus , in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal t cells in skin biopsy samples of mf - patients by tcr - pcr , followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis ( UNK ) .    3.3221556838778095
in 188 out of 208 mf patients , at least one skin sample with sufficient dna quality for pcr analysis was obtained .    3.2162569518107302
applying a consensus pcr for the tcr genes vi and j 1 / 2 , we detected monoclonal t cells in 122 cases ( 65 % ) .    2.791428837709276
in the remaining 66 cases , we performed two multiplex - UNK , covering rearrangements of the other tcr genes .    3.780319572459736
here we found in 11 cases ( 6 % ) predominant clonal rearrangements of vii - iv and j 1 / 2 and in 2 ( 1 % ) those of vi - iv and j p1 / 2 .    3.4940322981993037
in patients with mf , detecting rearrangements of only vi and j 1 / 2 is sufficient for pcr screening analysis .    2.8075904837243892
in 53 of the patients ( 28 % ) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal t cells .    3.8351274576429453
despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children , a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification .    3.0508095924590855
the aim of our retrospective cross - sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection .    3.302481346018172
the parents of 70 hearing - impaired children were interviewed .    3.2154381675189447
all children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities .    3.1563688779315724
at an average age of 19 . 5 months , parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment .    3.548793688122526
on average it then took an additional 7 . 2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation ( fitting of hearing aids ) .    3.140320335342173
significantly , total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments .    2.923338391483939
in addition to hearing loss , parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation .    2.998743714741025
statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing - impaired close relatives as well as first - born children tended to be diagnosed later .    3.4757897189786267
to further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss , the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration .    2.8672723861744926
after the incidental puncture of a UNK of the UNK trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization , a symptomatic av - fistula UNK .    3.742087847036204
the diagnosis was confirmed by angiography .    2.859078234011896
using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with UNK .    3.0205482497023723
175 patients were included between february 1994 and december 1997 .    3.909947106891501
every six months before and 1 , 5 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after htx , they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires : german sf 36 , heart failure and specific transplant symptom list , global quality of life assessment , munich life quality dimension list , expected / experienced life changes after htx , good UNK of the german language , and a minimum age of 18 years .    3.8223807880094554
during data evaluation , median ( UNK ) , mean ( m ) , and standard deviation ( sd ) were created from individual parameters .    4.325093158292898
quality of life was rated as very poor by 84 % of patients with congestive heart failure .    2.9002665159295797
only 6 weeks after htx , 74 % rated their quality of life as significantly better .    3.52920772269011
before htx 80 % were very UNK about their health status and 87 % about physical performance .    2.868908321756846
six weeks after htx , this parameter improved significantly and 76 % were very satisfied about their health status and 50 % about physical performance .    2.8008518341150928
while somatic changes expected before htx corresponded well with experienced ones , psychological improvements were smaller than expected , but one year after htx they were significant ( before : m = 3 . 66 ; sd = 0 . 9 ; range ( r ) = 3 . 78 vs 12 months postop : m = 4 . 61 ; sd = 0 . 6 ; r = 2 . 67 ; p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.1115660966265017
quality of life correlated before htx best with subjectively rated health ( r = 0 . 61 , p < 0 . 01 ) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status ( r = 0 . 76 , p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.822775130756072
only in 25 % were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity / satisfaction , professional situation , and recreational activities .    2.8913125598490543
90 % of UNK patients reported physical UNK , most by effects of immunsuppression , but were coping well .    3.9337806778486533
the study shows that already 6 weeks after successful htx all quality of life parameters improved significantly .    3.637472953020236
despite some UNK expectations and complaints , the postoperative life situation of htx patients appeared significantly improved .    2.888937822870427
sevoflurane is a " new " volatile inhaled anaesthetic .    3.266229288926998
owing to its lower blood - gas solubility coefficient , emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane , enflurane , or halothane .    2.9398253715444147
sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation , releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity .    2.7903640745443687
in this study , we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations ( UNK ) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane .    3.2476194219149828
furthermore , indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day .    2.9100767303347994
background : rarely , an additional brown ' s syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy .    3.4409231717741458
surgical measures are controversial and problematic .    3.341037045787337
metastasis formation is a UNK process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages .    3.969503356900445
one of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular UNK adhesion .    3.533748529592088
proteolysis of the extracellular matrix , as well as increased UNK , leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells .    3.831965055869568
in the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium , UNK and form metastases .    3.556001738990177
finally , neoangiogenesis is required for the initiation as well as the growth of the metastases , providing the tumor cells with both UNK agents and growth factors .    3.7984026287163286
this leads to the conclusion that anti - proteolytic and anti - angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth .    3.045692899705327
whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research .    2.9327130942390167
purpose : the purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint .    3.1782117327508757
a significant decrease in bladder capacity ( UNK ml to 331 . 9 ml ) , urethral closure pressure ( 89 . 6 cm h2o to 65 . , 2 cm h2o ) and functional profile length ( 61 mm to 25 . 9 mm ) was noted .    3.3447334874479773
the continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33 . 4 % after 1 month , 69 . 4 % after 3 months , 84 . 7 % after 6 months , and 90 . 9 % after 12 months , respectively .    4.212234497996571
a second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy .    3.1944286145358824
functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased .    3.167757056459492
these data suggest that restoration of continence is based on UNK parameters .    3.21378411263208
we are interested in the interaction of high - energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy .    3.445559699317193
the physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper .    3.504870991002837
the preliminary results give reason to hope , as ultrasound is easy to UNK and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound - accessible tumors .    3.2408863394020897
the changes observed in biological studies are clearly a function of the UNK parameters .    3.592362679777284
therefore , it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects .    2.955262261851658
recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online .    3.677975550123437
the capability of mri to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach .    3.643145766396469
the role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials .    3.40287906997893
posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling , complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates , or complete or partial closure of a growth plate .    3.4415939531950603
in contrast to fractures of the upper extremities , spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm .    4.199434081089629
in the context of the quality assurance program of the german pension insurance institutions , instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure , process , and results of inpatient rehabilitation , as well as patient satisfaction .    4.071144193675487
the routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on UNK in their current practice , so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved .    3.7236543033241714
when the " quality profiles " of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ( " UNK " ) , paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost - quality - ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals .    3.6613043901570808
in the present article , results of a first " field - run " of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported .    3.7228042049039103
a comparative analysis of patient satisfaction in four orthopaedic / rheumatologic rehabilitation hospitals showed high degrees of overall satisfaction in all hospitals .    2.9528698143148637
in several UNK of patient satisfaction , however , significant differences between hospitals were found .    4.284163200592531
quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer - review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals .    2.9867545683114005
problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation , e . g . , in the history and diagnosis of disabilities , in the consideration of psycho - social problems , or in the assessment of occupational capacities .    3.8893128507039023
the analysis of thr - failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement .    3.4936591193820132
the acetabular cup fails more often than the stem .    3.380818317271012
in the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups .    3.012987330496227
the known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases UNK 8 to 10 years after implantation , could of course not be seen in this study .    3.276305571029953
the success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis , age over 70 and the fixation manner : the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of UNK cups although the zweymüller - cup as well as the link type v - cup showed good results .    3.3189699875688587
the midterm results of the stem were very good for the cementless as for the cemented technique .    3.740469722428714
some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results .    3.101062015078841
the further implantation should be thought of , what partially has already happened .    2.9054122071654165
the results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable , so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions ( ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks , age under 60 ) .    3.4450197576370702
type i and type ii diabetes are the most common types of diabetes .    3.684568719793227
the ratio of type i to type ii diabetes is about 1 : 9 .    3.929921755958058
type i diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin - dependent diabetes . the disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ( " juvenile diabetes " ) , although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed .    3.285993593850765
morphologically , a subtotal ( > 80 % ) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic UNK occurs .    3.781720895337798
lymphocytic insulitis , which UNK after the beta cells have been totally destroyed , is pathognomonic of type i diabetes .    3.617121389409322
this insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors .    3.334063808374038
an important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition ( hla UNK / UNK / UNK ) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors ( e . g . , viruses ) .    3.8204088170960566
autoantibodies , such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies ( ica ) , insulin autoantibodies ( UNK ) , and / or autoantibodies to the UNK - UNK enzyme UNK acid UNK ( UNK ) , are already detectable in a UNK phase , although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion .    4.790373576312202
the course of the disease is dependent on age .    3.5222211499717253
young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults .    2.853923176312257
this article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence , diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( osas ) in children .    3.24432543720862
the prevalence of this disorder in 4 - 6 year old children is 0 . 7 % .    3.778430901403534
leading clinical sign in 90 % of patients is habitual snoring , but this is rather nonspecific , as 60 % of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have osas .    3.933877921430993
other signs such as daytime sleepiness , failure to thrive , UNK nocturnal UNK or mouth breathing are equally nonspecific .    2.887408015500889
the diagnosis , therefore , has to be confirmed by polysomnography , where osas is suggested by the occurrence of > 5 obstructive apneas / UNK per hour of sleep in conjunction with a co2 of > 50 mmhg for > 8 % of sleep time and / or > 1 desaturation to < = 90 % / h .    3.7238161693388814
patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun , and patients come to accept the UNK of death .    3.457157302480115
this can lead to a unique , highly emotional situation with direct or indirect , open or hidden , varied and very personal manifestations .    2.8358333296899665
the dermatological clinic in homburg was founded in 1945 .    3.0517201552856896
in 1947 it was integrated into the saarland university as a dermatology department .    3.0544870236165433
a review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology , as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years .    3.245447965417311
the coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures .    3.683575748467902
whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial .    3.159063011350229
we report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery .    2.6117608285078657
a 33 - year - old woman suffered from ovarian UNK syndrome after treatment with fsh / hcg for in - vitro fertilization .    3.3742940165945052
she developed a transient left hemiparesis .    3.004627899924223
this was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery .    3.4652684572143917
open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms .    3.416514803184916
the development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in UNK .    3.260604121010504
in 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife .    3.0391176622153613
now , we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the UNK and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986 .    4.356230236250635
the results are based on the analysis of a large population of UNK patients with the occupation " housewife " and the diagnosis " eczema " who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the information network of departments of dermatology ( ivdk ) .    3.256930085008158
data for hiv infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality .    3.0134818350776507
estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic , even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk .    3.9892492746480688
UNK of data from UNK couple cohort studies and from us UNK studies may be seriously UNK .    2.9228726862365737
infectivity of and susceptibility to hiv may be influenced by concomitant stds , antiretroviral therapy , UNK and / or UNK virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter - and intraindividual variability .    3.394456439502992
differences in factors influencing transmission probability of hiv most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of hiv .    3.030013735089744
between january 1989 and march 1997 , 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means ( median age 41 years , 39 f , 136 m ) .    3.0166395382651117
in 78 patients ( 17 f , 61 m ) a clinical and radiological follow up ( median 50 months , range 6 - 106 ) could be obtained .    3.446552115592577
additionally , a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients .    2.934312877236076
the recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years ( g < 30 ; n = 35 ) was 86 % ; in the group older than 30 years ( g > 30 ; n = 43 ) it was 21 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.2412093497239454
persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients ( 8 % ) .    3.7475544200908955
according to the rowe score , 16 patients ( 46 % ) of the g < 30 achieved excellent or good results , in the g > 30 , 29 patients ( 67 % ) .    3.64232522550915
in 17 % of cases , a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means .    3.4852825165768087
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity .    3.978524811530072
hill - sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases .    3.698200947943664
rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound .    3.8715796971876273
the recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients ' age .    3.158795792401496
we analyzed quality assurance protocol records of UNK geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on " length of stay " information ( los ) .    3.2291121215345666
14 . 47 % of cases were registered with different los ; 11 . 28 % of los information was missing .    3.7424875827328647
the increasing amount of documentation tasks in german geriatric hospitals is discussed .    2.9477323700719333
conclusion : we assume that not only discrete well known information ( admission and discharge dates , los ) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing .    2.9515646567477214
the majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively .    3.1985367384123506
only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated .    3.699952527164154
in young patients , however , fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided , but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted .    4.267870289028128
this procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk .    2.763289234727805
for this purpose UNK developed the hook screw , which connects the arch with the anterior articular process .    2.71206205814531
it allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw .    3.500571500388614
a follow - up study of the first 33 patients with a follow - up time of 3 . 5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients .    4.2257689493484545
in patients younger than 20 years of age , however , the result was good in 87 . 5 % of cases .    3.962311304381963
the reason for the better results in young patients is that in older patients the origin of the pain is often not the pars defect , but the degeneration of the intervertebral disk .    3.7296337672464377
direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive UNK of not more than 10 mm .    3.554687245724166
after the end of growth an mri study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not .    3.21728026044859
direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration .    3.823654479092565
after the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out .    3.660291175036093
we are presenting a 47 - year - old woman who was UNK by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of UNK .    2.7939856061985164
immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle UNK of the entire body .    4.062379829460931
after a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed , which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids .    3.0749414071162904
three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption , which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids .    3.232848217827544
raised UNK of igg and igm antibodies against different jellyfish from the UNK and UNK UNK were detected in the patient ' s serum by the enzyme - linked UNK assay .    4.250172180219043
antibodies against UNK ( class 1 ) and UNK ( class 4 ) were found by the radioallergosorbent test .    4.0970745330524085
the clinical features and the immunological findings led to the diagnosis of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis to jellyfish venom .    3.252878172694098
first aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested .    3.1031203144323984
the design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task .    3.4683984932940928
in particular in icd trials , false estimations and UNK have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial .    3.4043531887622533
identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure .    3.861077619340327
evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials .    3.1475644741015034
problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs .    3.553159595905818
further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared .    3.3910796564391807
technical UNK as UNK definitions , arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial , unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol .    3.269240629558828
a prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is UNK is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial .    3.5775084183376644
ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation .    2.9302725098877924
its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow - up .    3.5832461007203213
simple b - mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures , while color - coded duplex sonography ( ccds ) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion .    3.1449473274736914
more recent technical advances such as power doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation .    3.1308932990347085
the possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts .    4.061943793843257
purpose : the first morphological changes in eyes with hiv infection are microvascular disease of the retina with UNK - UNK spots and UNK .    3.615918540398866
the study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non - invasive methods .    3.494115139220258
the operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations ( mad ) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load - bearing .    3.102029546417031
in some cases the analysis of the mad does not show any angular deformity , but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone .    3.1136335479636146
such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone .    2.969470947930237
in combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone .    3.3235392282824585
in translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re - staggering made by a translation - osteotomy or by a UNK double osteotomy .    3.1496324797235764
in complex deformities with angulation and translation , the translation requires a separate corrective planning .    2.665560061783531
by using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the axis of correction of angulation ( aca ) in relation to the n - cora of the deformity has to be considered .    3.0295397104948427
if aca position is not conform with the n - cora position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur .    2.8901886845570193
these geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple UNK formulas or UNK methods .    2.8728282878417715
the employers ' liability insurance association for victuallers and UNK victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years .    2.834907236914108
the personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient ' s inability to work .    4.890183191255557
the basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program , which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them .    3.1288346256250295
meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it .    2.938974347570913
the objective is a national database on trauma medicine covering the whole of germany .    2.894526958066174
it is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the UNK of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation .    3.4422400310442813
due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase .    3.8991353843646315
nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures .    3.229221906224053
only the admission of rt - pa in the usa in 1996 for the systemic thrombolysis in ischemic insults less then 3 hours old led to a change in therapeutic strategies .    3.112616218856527
the good profit - risk - ratio of early thrombolysis with rt - pa could be confirmed by further studies lately .    3.1300879045780925
in the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the aha in the importance of grade a recommendation .    3.236511863004439
in europe thrombolysis is equally promoted as the procedure of choice .    3.142080481243806
at present only few patients receive such a treatment .    3.287934331171752
a thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra - structure .    3.278832010345022
furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time .    2.9679956361998894
unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention .    3.0657753476896645
therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the UNK of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic .    3.8399182680635136
a 69 - year - old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non - small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus , pulmonary artery and left atrium .    3.5096865880920163
using cardiopulmonary bypass , an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed .    3.602339118736432
the cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch .    3.183634202322096
the lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left UNK .    3.4346450132746735
after a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2 . 5 years postoperatively .    3.8019631257039377
in this retrospective study we report the indications , complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into UNK orbits .    3.390241084446401
the method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit .    2.7619234076622416
twenty - four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years .    3.1497837482839808
in the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing .    2.9440437416956224
all implants became integrated , none were lost because of infection or UNK .    3.2637867734147528
eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis , hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma .    2.8683509220939625
in the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures , UNK ( UNK ) and measuring the prosthesis motility ( UNK ) .    3.6195452148014917
three patients showed fair results ; all the others had good or very good results .    2.9813866315997863
in one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed .    3.0455522390000622
despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants .    2.946727591257381
liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis ( pbc ; stages i - iv ) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen - presenting cells .    3.1723586625020634
dendritic cells ( dcs ) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti - s 100 protein and kimlp antibodies .    3.499969219736401
we confirm previous findings that , in early pbc , s 100 protein - positive dcs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia .    3.319571100894143
however , the present study disclosed that s 100 protein - and kimlp - positive dcs regularly occur in UNK necroses ( pmns ) developing in pbc - associated chronic hepatitis .    2.9606578108382275
dcs in pmns were observed in all pbc stages , but were most prominent in late - stage pbc .    3.814917991047601
these findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in pbc may not be limited to bile ducts , but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma , producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity .    2.950059260338637
health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a UNK society , the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies .    3.595193275914276
the ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics .    3.5271617247022156
their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to UNK characteristic of emergency care .    3.2869308762568816
due to dwindling resources , the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized .    3.2326179982285836
possibilities of UNK care without compromising its quality are being discussed , such as UNK UNK therapy and implementing measures of prevention .    3.314650253933291
if emergency medical services are to accomplish their UNK , however , observing standards of medical practice , legal provisions , and the given framework of society , they must not UNK to pure cost containment .    3.8537201914921226
we performed a phase ii trial with second - line chemotherapy in patients with refractory , metastatic cancer of the bladder .    3.334213258174864
second - line therapy consists of 2 . 6 cycles of mitomycin - c , 5 - fluorouracil and folic acid .    3.286930191205341
we did not find any complete or partial remission .    3.365864342741214
four patients had a stable disease ; 3 . 3 months after therapy , patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months .    3.790447386222728
four patients reported an improvement in quality of life .    3.0821326426502598
since all patients received supportive care , improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone .    3.398369394951068
in conclusion , second - line chemotherapy with mitomycin - c , 5 - fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory , metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate - based chemotherapy .    2.498625609721803
every form of active euthanasia is a UNK offence under § 216 of the UNK code ; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view .    3.420554324092904
the many strands of the movement in favour of making " death on demand " UNK from UNK in germany as it is in the netherlands cannot change this .    3.4487240863394195
after introduction of the new drug , however , circulating quantities of etretinate were detected in patients treated with trans - acitretin .    3.7343753170811826
thus far , re - esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases .    3.5425104632926594
the 2 - month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans - acitretin has been extended to 2 years , as with etretinate .    3.0566911438327926
we review some aspects of trans - acitretin metabolism , with special emphasis on etretinate formation .    3.099605227082472
re - esterification of trans - acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients , as well as in animal models .    3.188373707772472
ethanol is a co - factor for the UNK re - esterification of trans - acitretin .    2.9523780330991376
it is unclear whether the introduction of trans - acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients .    3.0202829745816797
monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in UNK decisions for pregnancy .    3.029791960954398
during 1989 and 1990 , UNK athletes with acl ruptures were treated in our sports surgery department , and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study .    3.207664165165284
the patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of acl rupture had been made .    3.120991628249388
group i ( n = 129 ) underwent acl reconstruction using free bone - patellar tendon - bone autografts , while group ii ( n = 92 ) received conservative treatment .    3.4569795012535027
we were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow - up ( 42 from group i and 50 from group ii ) .    3.2959319354030088
the average follow - up period was 86 months .    2.877207155259656
there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients ' age , sex , or level of sports activity .    2.6815867439462058
follow - up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients .    3.7287955926343033
during follow - up , we used ikdc and oak scores to evaluate the results .    3.4242311706616895
we found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high - risk pivoting sports , but there was no difference if the patients were in the low - risk or no - risk pivoting group of athletes .    4.123952913440283
concerning reoperation and early arthrosis , the difference was significant between the two groups .    3.2097523005401194
background : by depletion of UNK UNK , enhanced levels of uv radiation reach the surface of the earth .    3.5602334786200984
exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to uv radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells .    3.6822558802024754
the aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength mri unit ( 0 . 2 t ; UNK , UNK ) and a high field strength mri unit ( 1 . 5 t ; siemens ) in detecting meniscal lesions .    3.3233841613643667
twenty patients were investigated on a 0 . 2 - t low - field mri unit and a 1 . 5 - t high - field mri unit for meniscal lesions .    3.2116357288335156
evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments ( anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus ) , for a total of 80 observations .    3.814716407830907
the reliability of diagnosis was UNK qualitatively on a three - point scale .    3.3589102810481615
investigations of the high - field mri unit revealed a meniscal tear in 6 patients and ruled out a tear in 14 patients .    2.8038424455795643
evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations .    2.315910315686272
investigations of the low - field mri unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients .    2.8405435172479203
evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations , with moderate confidence in 38 observations , and with low confidence in 3 observations .    2.5535591781504445
the diagnosis in high - and low - field images was identical in 98 . 7 % of cases ; in one patient observations from the high - field unit changed the therapeutic management .    3.9007973099252418
diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with UNK strength mr imaging .    3.559093860565857
low field strength mr imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging ; however , we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high - field mr imaging .    3.725782221512218
the past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells .    3.755928234099702
in the case of drug resistance mechanisms , the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical UNK .    2.9024661679496484
the experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors , such as p - glycoprotein , multidrug resistance associated protein , topoisomerase , or glutathione - s - UNK in urologic malignancies , is now relatively comprehensive , allowing for an initial analysis .    3.0642770984210466
clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful UNK .    3.5059073286581017
we expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be UNK in the future .    3.544831771500919
a study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery .    3.7000499773506186
a total of UNK impacted lower UNK teeth and 3 impacted lower second UNK were removed in 687 patients , all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively .    2.753420534505008
clinical , radiological , and surgical factors of each case were recorded .    3.4744287913898906
postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination .    3.324356907133472
follow - up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks .    3.555371789213449
dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3 . 57 % .    3.1759289445647414
the lingual nerve was injured in 2 . 1 % of patients .    3.3279153340896794
most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow - up period .    2.8616204504033362
dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0 . 91 % , and of the lingual nerve in 0 . 37 % .    3.23399152246865
however , the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general .    3.0525938349650996
the effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed .    3.726739464900196
for the inferior alveolar nerve , analysis revealed significant effects in older patients , for completely developed roots , for deeply impacted teeth , in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal , for difficult surgery , and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve .    3.5591268557226807
the surgeon and the anesthesia had a significant influence on lingual dysesthesia .    3.060138632132251
background : this review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of ( chronic ) low - back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed , because the validity , specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview .    4.003394487310386
the choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain , the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient .    3.7255563920203145
UNK and UNK are typical manifestations of yersinia infections in children .    3.269600618250092
this is a report on a child with localised UNK mesenteric UNK due to yersinia UNK persistent for a long time .    3.0053551309191198
we found specific antibodies against yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat - UNK in the patients ' serum .    3.907028669166595
only after a ciprofloxacin therapy for 16 weeks we observed a recovery of our patient .    3.1202461289951993
the present study investigates patients ' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements .    2.9744054094015664
fifty - five patients with tumors of different sites ( 30 with previous tumor - related surgery , 25 without surgery ) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire ( eortc qlq - c30 , UNK by UNK et al . , therapy - related expectations and success ) before and after inpatient radiotherapy .    3.292352212086698
the corresponding physician ratings were collected .    3.1377856979206253
fifty - eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal " healing " , whereas from the physician ' s UNK this was realistic in only 7 % of cases .    3.548612434072067
the specific radiotherapy - related expectations " tumor control " and " pain relief " reached almost the same levels in patients and physician ( 71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 % ) .    3.2433761281854117
patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy ( 53 . 4 % vs 39 . 9 % ) ; patients UNK pain relief reported lower quality of life ( 37 . 1 % vs 54 . 5 % ) .    3.793750304184779
the surgeon , as the primary contact person for patients , can influence patients ' therapy - related expectations .    3.64448023087393
in explaining the overall therapeutic strategy , surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies .    3.077975425068536
the meanings of the terms " quality " , " quality of care " , and " quality management " were clarified with common international definitions .    3.494817004167704
based on that , the basic ideas , concepts , and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained .    3.3990504926306166
finally some future trends related to quality were viewed , which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine .    3.0597372250644344
the papular - purpuric " gloves and socks " syndrome ( ppgss ) was first described in 1990 by harms et al .    2.0732660782091963
the syndrome is characterised by fever , an UNK erythema with edema , confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a " gloves and socks " distribution .    3.0878654117715114
the skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa .    3.383118367301115
viral infections , in particular parvovirus b19 , are the most likely trigger .    4.291460379389464
in the present case ppgss developed after taking trimethoprim / UNK .    2.595800181971425
since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re - challenge with the same drug , this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of ppgss .    3.371654654174944
most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment .    3.9267431929807093
on rare occasions , malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment .    3.0943155934004785
in these cases , clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered .    2.74609180339966
in four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment , we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity .    3.8082542086369666
in all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction .    2.7670433197021156
the deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction .    3.1473633083989427
in preoperative x - ray studies , the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0 . 9 and 2 . 2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle .    4.453536064651699
all patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft .    2.958488806344404
the follow - up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively .    3.4655337743831156
the functional outcome was evaluated using the constant - murley and the UNK score .    3.6666966612225007
all patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity .    2.807821420562773
the shoulder function rapidly improved , and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients .    3.9585218336934056
if there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures , extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results .    2.709775087572156
as the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow , the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial .    4.1499991998856585
although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new , the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern .    4.310801186706288
indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified .    3.3935994746739135
complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions .    3.4362681774605215
the skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible .    3.523577706708164
the continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies .    3.836681433997951
background : the mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease .    2.940153862718295
the cross - linking techniques optimized in UNK of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect .    3.171514763218379
in the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54 - year - old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor , spindle - cell neoplasia was seen .    2.8677650635391134
no clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible .    3.289813447556668
after resection of the right upper lobe of the lung , including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses , the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma .    4.096461521752423
this was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane UNK ( ema ) and of vimentin .    3.3754642585398518
extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with UNK localization .    3.497596016686393
this case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma .    2.9996671185446897
especially in small biopsy samples showing a submucous spindle - cell tumor of the lung , apart from frequent sarcoma metastases , the presence of primary synovial sarcoma of the lung has to be considered in the differential diagnosis .    3.496672024527489
necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality .    3.2648641362134048
formerly , surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard .    4.1658732803915095
improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis .    4.063263650843085
a considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation .    3.727412919231992
nevertheless , surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy .    3.4808179508424835
pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis , as results with regard to morbidity , mortality and long - term outcome are unsatisfactory .    3.893406327705397
today the surgical standard is careful digital necrosectomy , which must be followed by either UNK drainage , repeated open lavage or continuous closed lavage .    2.924403063361743
in experienced hands , all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality .    3.2893622038284547
the aim of quality management in rheumatology is to improve care and outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases .    3.625908059013093
this can be achieved by means of prospective long - term observation of the patient with regular documentation of clinical , radiological , biochemical and functional data using certain validated scoring methods ( das , radiological score , adl score UNK or health assessment questionnaire , UNK , etc . ) .    3.3002527020103565
long - term observation and documentation including radiographs have been performed in the rheumatology hospital in ratingen for 20 years without even knowing the term quality management .    3.039321901382229
quality management in a hospital for rheumatic diseases begins with certain structural prerequisites : possibility of direct admission of a patient to the hospital by the family physician , outpatient clinic to investigate and to follow patients over a long period of time , multidisciplinary team with specialists in rheumatology , orthopedic surgery , physiotherapy , UNK , special care , psychological , and social services , close cooperation with specialists in neurology , dermatology , ophthalmology , etc . , department of radiology , special laboratory , facilities for internal diagnostics and treatment .    3.2668670183103132
the hospital needs a training program for the qualification of rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons .    2.736252210369877
the hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who UNK patients and should continously support patient organizations .    3.1147583671553525
the quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors : selection , training and motivation of the hospital staff ; supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians , daily x - ray demonstrations and case reports , interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation , team reports , regular education including review of actual literature for physicians , education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses , and regular education programs for patients .    3.2426528557858836
process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient , whose opinion must be noted and regarded .    3.5921670869497584
as far as possible , the same doctor who UNK the patient in the hospital should follow her / him in the outpatient clinic .    3.598826000607796
the quality of outcome can be improved by regular UNK of the patient with control of medication , side effects , efficacy , documentation of clinical , biochemical , radiological , and functional data .    3.7575505685629764
decisions for further treatment have to be based on these follow - up data .    5.090808781384298
two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia ( UNK ) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) had initially focal , then generalized seizures of short duration .    2.9478274554094104
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed in one case minor parietal , cortical and subcortical increased signal on t2 - weighted images .    2.6513414220189504
in a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found .    3.1432129925815793
although chemotherapy was continued , a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared .    3.1581541774844673
hydatid disease is caused by the parasitic UNK echinococcus .    3.4781217402666544
the larval stage of this parasite can thrive in many parts of the body , most frequently in the liver .    3.2109439294262323
primary bone location is very rare , accounting for less than 2 % of all hydatid lesions .    4.0188538107941065
we report on a case of left - sided extended pelvic infestation .    2.9200323488411515
the destruction of the hip joint , os pubis , large parts of the ileum and the femoral head made pelvic resection and prosthetic replacement necessary .    3.4637382980997526
recurrence of a hydatid cyst 5 years later in the left groin originating from the proximal femur was treated with second femoral resection and new total hip replacement .    3.5939576763487056
because of instability , the primarily inserted UNK pelvic replacement had to be exchanged for a custom - made device fabricated with the aid of computer - aided design ( cad ) techniques .    2.860914149544946
this surgical procedure was combined with chemotherapy ( UNK ) .    3.510642595101762
the necessity of radical resection in UNK hydatid disease is discussed .    3.346604184419047
at present , phosphodiesterase iii inhibitors are commonly used for the treatment of low cardiac output states .    3.342037222263419
as a consequence , more UNK phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects .    3.0654357004637873
one of them , enoximone ( UNK UNK UNK , fig .    3.7427863180586347
1 ) , an UNK derivative , has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function .    3.456014323456227
in addition , in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent .    3.1636602903815416
recently a new substance , r80122 ( UNK , UNK , fig .    3.705937984420475
1 ) , was developed .    3.7598591947878925
the aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and r80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease .    2.688046125379559
the extremely rare finding of a proximal radio - ulnar synostosis in a 5 years - old girl with a fetal alcohol syndrome is presented .    3.1717867079687116
despite the elbow ' s being fixed at 30 ° pronation , the patient exhibits good ipsilateral arm function .    3.065725622232793
the difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed .    3.3598138874039174
ischemic preconditioning ( ip ) , using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained UNK - mia , represents a new approach in reducing ischemia - induced skeletal muscle damage .    3.111158657228751
the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ip on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a UNK model .    3.0050354942055466
ip protocols using one , two , or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each , were compared to non - UNK controls .    3.669745039400317
ip was found to significantly improve force , performance , endurance , and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle .    3.393658729879704
the efficacy of ip - induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles .    3.183768642287099
preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles .    4.44457279668879
altogether , this study describes the efficacy of ip in improving post - ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one ip cycle to achieve this improvement .    3.6440884932733972
pachyonychia congenita ( pc ) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia with variable expression .    3.467705225727635
the condition is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait .    3.3654560595788188
several classifications of pc have been proposed .    3.5098290832283645
UNK and colleagues suggested four clinical types of pc .    2.8160243879698457
type ii , the jackson - lawler - syndrome , is characterized by multiple epidermal cysts , palmoplantar bullae and hyperhidrosis as well as natal teeth in addition to the main findings of pachyonychia , palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and follicular keratosis .    3.3731964319975924
we report two patients ( father and son ) with jackson - lawler - syndrome and describe in detail pathogenesis , diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches as well as the different classifications of pachyonychia congenita .    3.0437633216845223
aim of this review article was to critically analyse the recently described UNK and molecular markers for testicular germ cell tumors with regard to their clinical utility .    3.5220605862720222
the UNK i ( 12p ) represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ .    2.9642641640755314
a number of proto - oncogenes ( cyclin d and UNK ) as well as putative tumor suppressor genes are localized on 12p ; however , their role in pathogenesis and prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors has not been defined yet .    3.685668255247342
clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors .    4.048636886260193
although a number of UNK loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified , the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown .    3.2088073310104517
with regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers , tumor suppressor genes , proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use .    3.5028231292921403
based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators .    3.378038687456614
investigation and identification of those factors determining the aggressive biologic behavior of embryonal carcinoma compared to all other histological components appear to be most promising in research for prognosticators of metastatic disease .    3.1316365419550305
after laparoscopic cholecystectomy , carbon dioxide ( co2 ) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity .    2.8610991106231616
there is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative co2 resorption .    3.135997244991761
without continuous postoperative monitoring , after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to co2 resorption .    2.933066029417653
studies exist on the course of end - expiratory co2 ( peco2 ) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing .    3.4244702394331332
the goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of co2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of co2 metabolism .    3.307505945682455
after giving informed consent to the study , which was approved by the local ethics committee , 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy .    3.9496555622199145
all patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia .    2.82263228108209
after induction , total iv anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl , propofol , and atracurium .    2.974353615630926
patients were ventilated with oxygen in air ( fio2 0 . 4 ) .    3.2709779047064673
the intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm hg .    3.389593388801551
thirty minutes after releasing the UNK ( kp ) , co2 elimination ( v . co2 ) , oxygen uptake ( v . o2 ) , and respiratory quotient ( rq ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor UNK according to the principle of UNK .    3.4582238327033625
assuming an unchanged metabolism , the co2 resorption ( v . co2 ) at any given time ( t ) can be calculated from v . co2 ( t ) = v . co2 ( t ) - rq ( preop ) v . o2 ( t ) .    3.166061804422815
it was thus necessary to define the patient ' s metabolism on the day of operation .    3.7672322244665533
the first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15 - min period .    3.3350928689836326
measuring point 0 was determined after UNK of the kp and emptying of the remaining co2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery .    3.818652135956041
patient ' s UNK were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the kp for 60 min .    3.4236212275999613
simultaneously , a nasal side - stream capnometry probe was placed and the peco2 and respiratory frequency ( rf ) were obtained by the UNK UNK ( datex ) and registered every minute as well .    3.3793159707160494
values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each .    3.2682957083352853
an arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15 - min period .    3.2162425054926747
postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well - being .    2.9589540121133795
all data were analysed by the UNK or wilcoxon test ; p < 0 . 05 was considered significant .    3.198585056728308
the findings do not indicate co2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( tables 2 and 3 , fig .    3.2589192316623685
arterial co2 as well as peco2 were elevated postoperatively ( 45 mm hg vs . 36 mm hg intraoperatively ) , while v . co2 and v . o2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period .    3.635323886324231
the postoperative rf was comparable to preoperative values .    3.2125574353384616
calculated co2 was lower than 10 ml / min and within accuracy of measurements .    4.119693231130569
the postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4 , and 3 . 75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered .    3.3279895375995174
all patients UNK UNK immediately after the operation , but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60 - min period of metabolic monitoring .    3.4683959964336735
there is no significant resorption of co2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the kp .    2.9512698664909136
up to this time , any co2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled .    3.0806708368062727
the gene of the cyclin - dependent kinase 4 ( UNK ) - inhibitor p16ink4a ( UNK / UNK ) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor - suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21 , a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma .    3.4152525936242486
an increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous UNK and mutations as well as the importance of p16ink4a in malignant melanoma .    3.49156863415336
the purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16ink4a and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors .    3.0386562256696785
the differential diagnosis includes UNK disorders , acute psychiatric symptoms of an hiv - associated encephalopathy , and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma .    2.931641415460721
clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders .    3.7246017780823735
secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging ( ct , mri ) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid .    3.5766217343497404
in emergency situations , however , german law imposes strict regulations , especially in the case of UNK patients .    3.761144950123777
these medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and UNK for an effective strategy are made .    3.2393656736291114
in simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings , patients with sympathetically maintained pain ( smp ) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb , also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic ( vasomotor ) dysfunction .    2.7005767738053366
these findings argue against the notion that smp must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge .    3.0215732678030607
intraoperative transluminal angioplasty ( ita ) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction , UNK the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years .    3.3234310651879024
whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature , reports on the procedural management of ita are rare .    3.8201765224671154
one of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and UNK implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location .    3.7453837150755556
in the following , the technique of UNK - and retrograde sheath implantation , either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft , is described in detail .    3.2461360010002522
by UNK particular standards for sheath introduction , ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ita can be kept to a minimum .    2.7577603408401017
the importance of the UNK of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated .    3.7354029396838335
in addition , the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated .    2.6451673447862025
in spite of new developments , including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon , the " ideal " angioplasty access sheath is , as yet , not available .    3.3261768969789425
the interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case .    2.8844606478939783
in sle patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids , the koebner phenomenon could not be found , while it was detected in patients with generalized dle who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones .    3.7300097015507854
it was not seen in patients with localized dle .    4.068667248476051
there was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the koebner phenomenon .    3.240796918888062
with regard to the UNK of the koebner phenomenon , it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network , with expression of adhesion molecules , might be involved .    3.7775806252703252
in 5 years 9 patients with a total of 16 painful ear nodules ( UNK UNK ) have been treated as follows .    3.8951781452648535
a small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination .    3.496584167497069
the rest of the nodule or any other nodules are UNK by means of the argon laser , also with local anaesthesia , including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules .    3.5511179716327796
there have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection .    2.748348935086617
new nodules occurring several months after treatment have been successfully treated in the same way .    3.907603392198083
there have been no real recurrences .    2.689089508538559
the cosmetic result is very good in all cases .    3.100726105720084
the patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy .    3.3144559444695774
laser therapy for painful nodules of the ear has good and lasting results , with a lower rate of recurrences than any other form of treatment .    3.595550658114833
we represent and discuss etiology , diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous UNK referring to an actual case of this rare disease .    3.5168325272960104
in the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease .    3.632547340012695
other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease .    3.0567890609168678
quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection UNK the sterile UNK as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis .    3.403175722177997
imaging diagnostics frequently fails to give indications of tuberculous origin of the lesion .    3.262198520792855
as before the evidence of mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis .    3.8180702396720867
despite required microbiological cultivation to make a UNK the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of mycobacteria even from tissue .    3.401206492758208
in such UNK cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours .    2.937352498114248
in surgical procedures associated with high blood loss , such as vascular and cardiac operations , differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance .    3.872674259175823
preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [ drug - induced platelet disorders ( in particular UNK ) , von willebrand ' s disease and other congenital platelet disorders ] is effective in minimizing blood loss .    3.7420181073141743
bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance .    3.0894665915537423
therefore , simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems .    3.308861579056738
the aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding .    2.932755980771492
progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post - thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux .    3.5806527565542465
if conservative treatment fails , UNK valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux .    3.2926753985546218
following this report , the results and limitations of this method are discussed .    4.5637016029923165
their persistence during full clinical remission , however , is associated with an increased risk for relapse and , thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders .    3.3814849945291345
in order to test this hypothesis , we designed a prospective study in which healthy first - degree relatives ( high - risk probands ; hrps ; n = 54 ) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography , the combined dexamethasone and UNK - releasing hormone ( dex - crh ) test and a variety of psychometric scales .    3.6171877114608293
in the present part of the study ( index assessment ) , these hrps , as a group , showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the dex - crh - test outcome ; furthermore , their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing " rigidity " and " autonomic UNK " .    3.1740766562361125
on a single - case level , 35 % of the hrps were identified as conspicuous ( depressionlike ) in at least two of the three areas investigated .    4.025659921423122
a decision of whether or not this " UNK " indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow - up part of the study has identified those hrps with their respective UNK status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime .    3.5589684617867183
undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary UNK syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses , two miscarriages and myocarditis .    3.2984771541444977
despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild UNK pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events , cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders .    3.103475098641253
UNK in a dosage of up to 4 . 5 ng / kg / min for a total of 15 months , her 6 min walking - distance improved from 210 to 315 m , the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from UNK to UNK UNK - 5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 64 to 54 mmhg .    3.9869075390553053
this partial success of conservative treatment enabled a UNK of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation .    4.081951170430248
only few patients with ais are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms , and only 3 % of these patients qualify for treatment with rt - pa .    3.4511017741743863
therefore , only few patients with ais will potentially benefit from therapy with rt - pa if ninds criteria are applied .    2.8834517035220877
the goal of the second european - UNK acute stroke study ( ecass ii ) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa in ais for a 6 hour time window .    3.007154346285798
the radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy .    3.150416003016699
the accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the tnm - classification ( uicc ) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages UNK to UNK .    3.8614185306652113
the clinically ( c1 ) and sonographically ( c2 ) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications .    3.324233833751686
the clinical staging was correct in 75 . 0 % , high in 7 . 7 % , low in 17 . 3 % , the n - stages were correct in 59 . 2 % , high in 17 . 7 % , low in 23 . 1 % .    3.611609215736527
the sonographic staging was apparently superior with the t - classifications correct in 92 . 3 % , high in 7 . 7 % , low 0 . 0 % .    3.304506534584792
the n - stages were correct in 89 . 6 % , high in 9 . 2 % , low in 1 . 2 % .    3.692758743299006
the accuracy of combined UNK classification rose from clinical 46 . 5 % to 84 . 6 % by sonography .    3.8856633759604096
accompanying inflammations , foregoing biopsies and tooth extractions were the main reasons for incorrect staging .    3.2400521647322433
therefore , the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures , due to little patient discomfort , good availability and high accuracy , is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging , therapy - planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions .    3.5148573387651085
standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure ( chf ) have not been established .    3.6272765521382055
in the past chf patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment , with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35 % and a peak vo2 between 12 . 2 and 25 . 4 ml / kg / min on average .    3.477228437047136
for determination of training intensity , a vo2 between 40 and 70 % of peak vo2 and / or training heart rate between 60 and 80 % of peak heart rate was used .    3.7326201733721356
there was also a wide range for frequency ( between 3 and 7 times per week ) and duration of training ( between 20 and 60 min per session ) .    3.299972621020601
for aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied .    3.0915683029251264
we have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain .    2.832685949269895
after only three weeks of training , the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods .    3.1613800654673923
to determine work rate for work phases of interval training , a special steep UNK test was developed .    3.03952356722837
by analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training , both were proven to be UNK in chf patients , even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13 % , or peak cardiac index not greater than 1 . 6 l / m2 / min , and peak vo2 less than 8 . 5 ml / kg / min .    3.7553026461499455
therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician .    3.7776683295293645
small ( t1 ) and exophytic ( t1 , t2 ) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy .    2.9967319867983586
limited lesions ( t1 , t2 ) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies .    3.1363176217064126
extensive tumors ( large t2 ; t3 ) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation , especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy .    3.387262421058202
when radiation treatment fails , surgery UNK in more than half of the cases .    3.158289303651608
tumors infiltrating or UNK the laryngeal framework ( t4 ) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy .    3.236725529722062
subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts .    2.9894824039558148
lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease .    4.69516262245381
inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases , with the exception of early glottic cancer .    4.004070517082789
induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50 - 60 mm hg in normotensive subjects .    3.9316058576216903
the aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss , decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions .    3.3753439390255044
most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50 % in many surgical procedures ; however , some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced .    3.2842296354808886
proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss .    3.820846522340334
major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow ( i . e .    3.545893776784422
ischaemia ) of vital organs ( brain , myocardium ) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients .    3.3219920015692037
thus , major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease , hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease .    3.342669351075194
complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients , but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction .    3.952942967760186
therefore , careful assessment and selection of patients , together with consideration of the potential complications , appropriate choice of drugs and invasive UNK - beat monitoring , are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension .    3.64597419745538
abstract empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life .    2.818276918309109
the interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to UNK of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment .    3.895343942514101
the mutual regulation of the caregiver - infant - pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements .    3.000088629860333
this UNK function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms .    2.87508412640581
first experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self - regulation are reported .    3.968095011215528
a 31 - year - old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction .    3.255921704079285
the patient ' s preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before .    3.2366495089019898
the physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs .    3.5220084078385665
anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side , using routine precautions pre - oxygenation , and rapid sequence intubation , and was maintained UNK .    3.266632825389274
about 20 min after the onset of surgery , hypotension , tachycardia , and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared .    4.271165454936431
volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation .    3.2218367684128886
elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left UNK of the operating table did not lead to improvement .    4.276082899855151
the development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction .    3.6612119522949396
the suspicion of latex - related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio - allergen - UNK test ( rast ) and prick and scratch tests .    2.9462244795208905
the mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two UNK of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation .    3.626492234051571
the heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy .    2.855351316507054
during late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position .    3.3877441259338346
a fall in heart rate was only seen in this period .    3.4857714262063504
a fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy .    2.974088048409347
the UNK symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy .    2.9597173451091847
headaches , fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints .    3.821374556992275
the frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation .    3.213883962406886
blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women .    2.8913221159787375
however , the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position .    3.1521982240161144
the birth - weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position , but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing .    3.2755053730356356
pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight .    3.261462319986889
these results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction .    2.8948444687029538
the combination of UNK baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis .    2.7832729469618487
the aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts , original salt from the dead sea and sodium chloride .    2.4509941880741146
the salt concentrations tested were 1 % , 3 % 5 % and 15 % .    4.119725328160699
tap water followed by uvb and uvb alone served as controls .    2.70617759917092
erythema was determined by visual and UNK measurement , and delayed tanning was assessed by UNK .    3.6103729785785657
erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to uvb irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by uvb alone .    3.0248576066780664
the most prominent erythema was yielded by tap water + uvb .    2.8174389315528643
the salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5 % solutions .    3.12699987469437
there was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation .    2.7460389076157123
the results from the present study indicate that UNK the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent uvb irradiation .    3.4192843842342926
this may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by uv irradiation and may account for an increased UNK risk after bathing .    3.498568517886907
introduction : the aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis , e . g . early elective resection and primary anastomosis .    3.0511161868648773
methods : the data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified hinchey classification ( stages 0 - iii ) .    2.8682985985794978
results : within our study group the morbidity was 26 . 5 % ( n = 118 ) and the mortality was 1 . 6 % ( n = 7 ) .    4.703660846154088
in 96 % ( n = 425 ) of all cases and in 64 % ( 21 / 33 ) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis ( stage iii ) , a primary anastomosis was performed .    4.374513755135325
four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis ( 0 . 9 % ) .    3.867010662139768
no leakage was observed from any of the anastomoses performed in stage iii diverticulitis .    3.536336909821166
stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality .    3.2706465062421977
some 53 % ( 94 / 177 ) of the patients in stage ii and 67 % ( 22 / 33 ) of the patients in stage iii had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before .    3.6397189993996166
conclusion : prophylactic surgery to avoid life - threatening situations , including abscess formation or perforation , is not possible in many cases .    3.539416744223119
however , especially patients at risk ( age , coexisting illness ) should undergo early surgery .    3.1654124732852122
primary anastomosis can be performed safely even at an advanced stage .    3.4559439173436193
to evaluate whether mri is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined .    2.6198156277535687
tumor staging by ct and mr imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium .    3.3980070309707373
in mri 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy , in ct none .    3.138814900979591
in advanced renal carcinoma mri with gadolinium was superior to ct imaging , especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus .    3.409739821374125
consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by mri which therefore may replace conventional cavography .    3.4721136797575496
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study ; nine of the mothers were known to be co - infected with hiv - 1 .    3.8803809600542323
these 90 children were first tested within 60 days after birth and followed for at least three months .    3.2572717869960854
three of the 90 children became infected UNK with hcv as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the rt - pcr .    3.287560770105733
one of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated UNK UNK values , but is otherwise clinically well , likewise the other 2 infected children .    3.0476330018097304
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year .    3.175075797364984
cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane UNK the right atrium into two chambers .    4.1403339258331
the membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus UNK valve ( rsv ) .    3.4372395811840284
normally the rsv UNK between the UNK and UNK week of gestation , as the UNK portion forms the crista UNK and the caudal portion develops into the eustachian and UNK valve .    4.134597284060789
any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of rsv as a simple muscle bar , a chiari - network or a UNK or UNK membrane ( cor triatriatum dexter ) .    3.230042163327549
we describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful UNK procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis .    2.9452177607577124
apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow .    3.2195916802131057
therefore , dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters .    3.0116631964716163
however , since only few data are available from previous studies , we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism .    3.7697969744736675
a total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders ( cmpds ) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study .    2.7507604902188136
apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the UNK - technique and topoisomerase ii expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody ki - s1 .    3.727901838733039
furthermore , by determination of the proliferating - cell nuclear antigen labeling ( pcna ) index , we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the g2 / m phase , because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle .    3.0738821308172493
patients with imf , pv , and et revealed a normal range of apoptosis , whereas in chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) a significant increase could be observed .    3.1777731300205527
on the other hand , imf and pv were characterized by a raised proliferative activity .    2.5617422588184406
dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index .    3.646556656910492
in cml and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable , but imf and pv showed a significant increase .    3.4686009469026873
survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation .    3.7046553856717424
in conclusion , our in - situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics .    2.888120467004618
in this context , a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and / or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome .    3.4384064666916867
in a complex animal model in sheep , polydioxanone ( pds ) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital - wall defects .    2.948874808392546
in a long - term experiment over 1 year , polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation .    3.1666101448433692
as soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery , they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall .    3.3688372287677906
surgery by three - dimensional ( 3d ) endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and , in special cases , in thoracic surgery ; however , it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery .    3.3248637530781586
we inserted a 3 - d endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high - frequency jet ventilation .    3.2008546344084063
the studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator , and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery .    3.1304425422573194
the measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters : expiratory resistance , tidal volume , and peak inspiratory pressure .    3.1583660935813573
the mean fio2 was 0 . 74 + / - 0 . 1 ; the mean pao2 was 169 . 2 + / - 80 . 4 mm hg ; and the mean paco2 was 40 . 9 + / - 2 . 4 mm hg .    3.8242958824976596
the mean airway pressure was 19 + / - 5 . 3 mm hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12 . 3 + / - 6 . 9 mm hg after insertion .    3.5326467679283575
the mean positive end - expiratory pressure values increased from 2 + / - 0 . 6 to 3 . 6 + / - 2 . 3 mm hg .    3.8530296578960797
reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes .    3.4843159810182067
in the clinical application of 3 - d endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope , it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation , inspection of the surgical field , and performance of the surgical procedure .    3.702627551972487
a co2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime .    3.2075439727486255
although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery , it is presently possible to safely use the 3 - d endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery , presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice - improving microsurgery of the larynx .    3.1958591970793058
UNK specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips .    3.448702420673388
the cystic duct was fixed , and the transverse placed clips were UNK in axial direction and the forces registered .    3.675694472211946
the median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4 . 1 n and 11 . 2 n with a highly significant difference ( p < 0 . 001 , kruskal - wallis anova ) .    2.861719283026303
in detail , both resorbable clips ( polydioxanone , UNK / UNK acetate ) were superior to the four titanium clips ( p < 0 . 005 , wilcoxon test ) .    3.3898091227583405
in addition to the advantage of complete UNK , these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips .    3.36452908799395
hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers .    3.0969852146561916
the efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to o2 transport and especially the effective o2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations , such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock .    3.73630228403467
this results in a clinically UNK intravascular half - life of about 8 - 24 h , an adequate o2 affinity , and a lack of nephrotoxicity .    3.7893508294123524
a degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here .    3.198723156666875
in spite of this , hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans .    2.996809522640419
fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are , therefore , well suited for the transport of o2 and co2 .    3.2949302738128754
the capacity for the release of o2 to the tissues is especially excellent .    3.4028842249688678
this was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution , during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation .    2.956745086690965
UNK , the most important representative of the fluorocarbon emulsions , has also been successfully used in man and is well tolerated .    3.7089474940529814
the introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients .    3.081321453638717
UNK is expected within the next few years .    2.7557684258781494
the new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood - gas and tissue - blood UNK coefficients , so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected .    3.408871463807704
the aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery .    2.951881142988245
in acute coronary syndromes , arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density .    3.0538431673108293
the underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear .    2.8277803860668476
among others , increased programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) is postulated .    3.054891730763829
coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina ( group 1 ) and from 24 patients with stable angina ( group 2 ) were examined , using immunohistochemistry ( UNK test to detect fragmented dna ) and transmission electron microscopy .    3.5178901106920786
the objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition , to detect and quantify cell death , and to UNK between apoptosis and necrosis .    4.051737467255584
on UNK of the UNK UNK of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in UNK in the years from 1926 to 1937 .    4.797721368164535
these operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation .    3.4196302756535717
this work UNK by UNK scientist s . UNK and the surgeon n . terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public .    4.054490490430579
the first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart , the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism , and principles of open heart surgery stated by n . terebinski were decades UNK of the development at the time .    3.7266960195615746
aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare .    4.602106942260738
the literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations .    2.9613435704605737
in the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right - sided intrapetrous UNK after myringotomy , which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media .    3.079655050514041
due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible .    3.6841594463792595
subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms .    3.644760873724708
leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle , fascia lata and a UNK - UNK - formalin - glue ( cardial ) .    3.302496928108311
in order to apply the tissue patch the UNK site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior UNK approach .    2.908781334718904
due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries .    2.8943795928363625
temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm .    3.298760791854879
following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy .    3.2421143803319565
blindness causes human suffering and high social costs .    3.440853786611978
virtually all blind people are registered with the social services .    3.5024129061094227
data from these institutions may help in ( long - term ) planning for blindness prevention .    3.4540639373739177
the stage - oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice .    2.8235070590208142
nowadays , partial stem varicosis , which is an earlier stage of the disease , leads to operative treatment more frequently than 10 years ago ; thus a sufficient vein stump remains after surgical treatment .    3.5089392606884053
after surgery on a group of 1000 patients , we examined the stumps for patency , the occurrence of varicose changes , for their availability in the long term , and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery .    3.5660542462807747
the treatment of insufficient UNK veins was also included in the surgical therapy , as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins .    3.7757353805394414
with a follow - up period of up to 33 months postoperatively , the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps ( 97 % ) , as well as a high sufficiency rate ( 94 % ) , with a mean graft length of 29 . 4 cm .    4.043164664390309
thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions .    3.0949193791664062
this study supports the call for the stage - oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis .    3.042712886571709
background : corneal hla - dr antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage .    2.8956722883727055
this study investigated if this phenomenon is based on down - regulation of the hla - dr antigen , or on a loss of the hla - dr - positive corneal langerhans cells ( UNK ) .    2.8174106871991933
the authors present a rare case of solitary non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) in the skull of an 11 - year - old girl .    3.0851993446378523
the clinical , radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report .    3.463520006794485
the morphological features of intra - and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging .    3.430090980758377
although rare , nhl should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children .    2.865851982242781
neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as parkinson disease and alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age .    3.370388188493731
the neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years , particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies , resulting in the development of new disease - specific antibodies .    3.996514964668347
internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made .    2.9558859391184646
to obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis , particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies , studies with clinically and neuropathologically well - documented cases are needed .    3.83570566025478
the project " brain - net " has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a german brain and tissue bank for diseases of the central nervous system .    3.285146306868675
the project is funded by the federal ministry of education and research .    2.9129395051755806
fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the UNK child ' s life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally .    3.449208989660999
such surgery is a clinical reality now .    3.840670299232739
indications for UNK surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities , especially in the upper respiratory tract .    3.614958768123493
these include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias , prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary UNK , and resection of embryonic tumors that UNK the respiratory tract .    3.7207223124221174
the relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques .    2.9327364203345794
endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance .    3.1701095322355504
in part of the procedures , only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use .    3.592332733725768
further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions , even in cases with non - lethal conditions .    4.021461114510521
more diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications .    3.943985640176761
one example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate , which until now has only been performed in animal experiments .    3.099798570528584
the particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy .    3.204967975205371
this offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is UNK externally and avoids growth - UNK scars .    3.1816725218480726
we report on a 57 - year - old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate .    2.7753655996372792
for UNK correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system .    3.3183297567330943
in 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors ( 4 ewing , 1 recurrent UNK , 1 UNK UNK ) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation .    3.4194946622984093
one recurrence occurred in the host bed ; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection .    4.051266037118274
the other cases showed good functional and radiological results .    3.518939564993661
these clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo - and radiotherapy - sensitive bone tumors .    3.4040786646301457
effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial .    3.6387652486585895
numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality .    2.991306308241334
in patients undergoing vascular surgery , epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative UNK .    2.9887635992924784
these patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re - operation .    3.588915496329061
however , regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies .    2.913536562101153
one reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care .    3.027041254547968
a multimodal therapeutic approach , which consists of UNK patient information , sufficient analgesia , early mobilisation and enteral feeding , may solve this discrepancy .    3.1515240838483662
therefore , prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome .    3.8134020511358817
although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after alzheimer ' s desease , vascular dementia ( vd ) has remained so far an ill - defined term .    3.130340853243773
the main problems in the definition of vd arise from finding criteria for both terms " vascular " and " dementia " .    3.382651710254855
the detailed criteria for the diagnosis of vd proposed by several groups or institutions ( UNK , dsm - iv , icd - 10 , ninds - UNK ) are critically reviewed .    4.18398043378228
the diagnostic value of some clinical findings , especially the very frequent white matter UNK in ct ( UNK - UNK ) , are discussed .    3.681218759764737
the available studies suggest a differentiation of vd into some subtypes ( listed according to frequency ) : subcortical vd , vd with acute onset , UNK - dementia , mixed types , and specific forms .    3.048626673491414
nevertheless , these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and , therefore , no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies .    3.424553256394168
the aetiology of varicosis is still unclear .    3.021493795990436
investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins .    3.4707228408552036
the rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins ; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the " normal " vein below this competent valve .    3.3341449083508334
the matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres , whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented , explained the rigidity of varices .    3.529797463075936
these results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall .    3.835046675009829
an investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the UNK ligaments ( mfl ) UNK and wrisberg .    3.8424724560453094
of the knees examined , 96 % showed one or more ligaments , the incidence was independent of gender or age .    3.687085213617342
the ventral notch width index ( UNK ) after UNK was 0 . 22 in females and 0 . 24 in males .    3.597018972983813
a dorsal notch width index ( UNK ) , which has not been described so far , was 0 . 26 in females and 0 . 28 in males .    3.617868518743757
the ligamentum UNK posterius ( wrisberg ) showed distinct morphological variations .    2.947320510622158
the results of the study underline the importance of the mfl for knee joint function including stabilization , proprioception , and meniscal positioning .    2.975867321553032
eleven patients with high - grade mucosal dysplasia in a columnar - lined oesophagus and 2 patients with a squamous carcinoma ( UNK ) underwent photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) and argon - plasma coagulation ( apc ) .    3.4260215222598656
for pdt , 5 - aminolevulinic acid ( 5 - ala ) was given orally ( 60 mg / kg ) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 j / cm2 ( 100 mw / cm2 ) at UNK nm 4 - 6 h later .    3.408949664200862
a second pdt was performed under the same conditions 2 - 3 weeks later .    3.431673912449968
patients who received apc were treated 4 times on average to reach radical barrett mucosa eradication .    3.0051921983790435
all patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production .    2.7191608378526335
no complications occurred in either group .    2.4528046677318
follow - up UNK and multiple biopsies for 3 - 42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar - lined oesophagus in all 11 patients .    3.0278013883776915
two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence 9 and 12 months later .    3.7802867356628918
pdt with 5 - ala - induced endogenous UNK , as well as apc combined with omeprazole protection , can eradicate superficial high - grade dysplastic mucosa in barrett ' s oesophagus .    3.399665599977176
however , we did not succeed in UNK a manifest carcinoma .    3.165098854853634
technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children .    3.168560774848803
the rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is UNK breathing , resulting in a decreased need for sedation .    3.060635529128672
in addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend ct - investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading .    3.4009017978462808
radiation dose reduction of 70 % is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information .    3.4605205088015087
spiral low - dose ct in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases , mediastinal masses and central airway malformations .    3.190396338121625
whether abdominal helical ct can be replaced by mri has to be decided in each individual case .    3.3741108616627025
when an exact protocol is used , sufficient contrast material given , scan - delay optimized and UNK reconstructions are performed , usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method .    3.1987315155756306
invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine .    3.5378031607061975
despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology , there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen .    3.276403889925163
opened UNK areas the UNK indications in a branch of dermatology and UNK diseases are represented .    3.215789451988648
with the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local UNK are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use .    3.823310819081146
at present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents .    3.040269029048481
thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals , in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration .    3.266141675492193
hydatid disease , still frequent in endemic areas , is usually localized in the liver .    3.3009846774810123
despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay .    3.8126407311034423
based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice , as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily .    3.7322346896753467
background : central catheters in UNK intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of UNK or parenteral infusions .    3.9173497053579633
low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in UNK size , density , and physical as well as chemical properties .    3.597574567751503
regarding size and density , ldl can be divided into two main profiles , ldl pattern a with elevated concentration of large , UNK ldl particles and ldl pattern b with increased concentration of small , dense ldl particles .    2.717137346852957
the latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of hdl and particularly hdl2 cholesterol .    2.9618954617172393
the ldl profile of increased concentration of small , dense ldl particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events .    2.7884682289519396
the ldl profile is partly genetically determined , but can be improved by non - pharmacological ( exercise , diet ) and pharmacological intervention .    3.0632548122679872
it remains to be confirmed whether the ldl UNK profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides hdl2 cholesterol and triglycerides , but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk .    3.04625512004495
traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia .    3.1258438223843035
in the hand , which is perfused by two arteries , this symptom could be missed .    3.518822702125391
the UNK hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal UNK UNK .    3.977630218353522
dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late .    4.211497716602345
a specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion .    3.4492693914418715
there is no proven therapeutic procedure .    2.862405342250334
exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention .    5.079665677848803
the administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia .    3.8354094870493745
however , the administration is associated with side effects , including respiratory depression , somnolence and pruritus .    3.670700409386035
a rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine , hydromorphone , alfentanil , fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini - review .    2.879925510092497
thus , the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages .    2.9622991495058457
UNK , epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route .    3.2501147883762442
in future , reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0 . 05 - 0 . 1 % may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone .    3.4442606621712506
the same holds true for 2 - adrenoceptor agonists as UNK .    3.0206217952969685
however , multicenter dose - ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome .    3.4379192860796595
moreover , we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques .    3.011753034694697
today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method .    3.5169828651436013
progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization .    4.361861957399025
preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of t4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure .    2.930945095441857
the complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation .    4.013616401267281
by using UNK for embolization , palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor - related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful .    3.3481431814935765
although local control of the tumor disease , including complete tumor ablation , is achieved by embolization , the median survival rate of our UNK embolized patients is only 3 . 5 months .    4.2681254817484096
this short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor .    3.8028196793925204
content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the clinic for maxillofacial surgery at the charité .    3.394178177506214
robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand .    3.4781707843883676
in this paper firstly the state of the art is described .    2.730474920758792
subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail .    3.0455567622908846
the paper UNK with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery .    2.943059349369787
giant - cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern , frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given , and may potentially metastasize .    3.1039754088955025
by virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta - articular localization , giant - cell bone tumors require specific surgical management .    2.737116862562044
thus , an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone UNK , possibly combined with instillation of UNK or cryotherapy .    2.925502799719928
these combined treatment modalities assure a high - quality procedure , defined as the actual way medical care is delivered , by promoting the quality of the outcome , defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient ' s state of health .    3.905223607073487
we report two patients with partial trisomy of the long arm of chromosome 7 and partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 17 .    2.8657470607381663
chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives .    3.362485529372772
UNK analysis reveals abortions , frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths .    2.8241996285447484
our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms : prominent forehead , hydrocephalus UNK with wide cranial sutures and UNK , hypertelorism , cleft soft palate , low set UNK ears , psychomotor retardation and UNK .    3.071750658429189
renal cell carcinomas ( rcc ) are UNK with impressive metastatic potential .    3.423062395609659
patients with rcc who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort .    2.9053455717301584
due to the different long - term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic rcc lesions , a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible .    3.3771662947563876
several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment , especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases .    3.9246359071915227
most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of rcc metastases , surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons , UNK , and orthopaedic surgeons .    4.11332458751577
therefore , an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients .    3.2724760519541554
the term langerhans cell histiocytosis , previously " histiocytosis x " , encompasses three different syndromes : eosinophilic granuloma of bone , hand - UNK - christian disease and UNK - UNK UNK disease .    3.4855543068410135
all are rare manifestations in childhood .    3.3396606264974373
the tentative diagnosis after examination , conventional radiologic procedures and computerized tomography was eosinophilic granuloma .    3.0355469355266216
magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging - angiography revealed the acute threat to the child caused by the intracranial expanding mass lesion with almost complete obstruction of the UNK UNK .    3.557167035612579
thrombosis and the risk of bleeding were decreased by early and complete exstirpation of the tumor .    3.3560349726558183
after two years follow - up , no new lesions had appeared .    3.245940182750321
the diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation .    3.5329638301852917
spontaneous rupture is the main , potentially lethal complication , found in 25 % of cases .    3.5747796139664105
the problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis , because they are asymptomatic for a long time .    3.055825727215904
in the case of rupture , splenectomy is a life - saving procedure .    3.15470053122484
we report on a 56 - year - old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen .    2.506502947932711
exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas , causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described .    3.290226776018376
the hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) as a t cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of t cells .    3.4597627968989624
the development of monoclonal antibodies against the t cell surface molecule cd4 has raised UNK to achieve a major progress in the treatment of ra .    3.6293279853019516
however , after encouraging results in early open studies , double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti - cd4 - therapy in ra .    3.452819348684763
there are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach .    3.320692786304163
the final evaluation of anti - cd4 therapy in ra will be possible only after the testing of newly developed non - UNK anti - cd4 anti - bodies .    3.2761779206021298
purpose : for some time , the ambulatory diagnosis of respiratory disturbances during sleep has included the use of seven - channel recording units .    3.411518178755192
one of these systems is the poly - UNK unit ( map , germany ) .    2.9628329218262848
guanine nucleotide - binding proteins ( g proteins ) function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors .    3.0240670763289086
a large number of g protein - linked receptors funnel extra - cellular signals as diverse as hormones , growth factors , neurotransmitters , and primary sensory stimuli through a set of g proteins to a small number of second - messenger systems .    2.934383987515517
the g proteins act as molecular switches with an " on " and " off " state governed by a gtpase cycle .    3.2077059507677563
by virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic gtpase activity , the - subunit of the g protein ( g ) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding g protein .    2.9642913932904364
mutations of g may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations .    3.326610998607291
given the variety of functions UNK by g protein - coupled signal transduction , it is not surprising that abnormalities in g protein - coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as UNK as blindness , hormone resistance , precocious puberty and neoplasia .    2.9993214318116057
for a given defect in a g protein - coupled pathway , the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component .    3.6033011393434995
defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component , particularly in germline mutations ( e . g . , albright ' s hereditary UNK ) , whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an UNK expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal ( e . g . , UNK - albright syndrome ) .    3.0392657060856827
mivacurium is a short - acting , UNK muscle relaxant of the UNK type that undergoes rapid breakdown by plasma cholinesterase .    3.7611881007241266
after 2 . 5 times the ed95 ( 0 . 2 mg / kg ) , tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2 - 3 min following injection .    3.596492905258063
the ensuing UNK 25 % ( i . e . , time from injection to 25 % recovery of control twitch tension ) is three times as long as with succinylcholine .    3.0729410022957184
the principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3 - 4 times the ed95 .    3.1812814364040203
in patients with end - stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase , the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged .    3.3285984287149315
the performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes .    3.2961740902362653
after 15 min of maximal freezing a tissue region 22 mm in diameter was frozen to temperatures below - 50 °c by one active UNK .    2.6828000887394716
with three cryoprobes , using the synergistic cooling effect , a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was UNK to temperatures below - 50 °c .    3.0902337168000975
optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance .    4.13281386068319
attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years .    3.5033722906095717
the adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future .    3.0116529192124206
coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated .    3.126996515773684
elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied , they were also less anxious , and more often positive about their future .    3.234613368324196
if their adult children had secure attachment representation , they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially , UNK , and UNK more supportive .    3.5721174178802326
mri allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast .    3.765705035555906
the natural diffusion of tissue UNK can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism .    3.59261007380846
different mri techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion - weighted images .    3.15394417409373
these techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast .    3.731980661919801
in the current article , the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented .    3.3085944377674577
after a short introduction into the basic physical principles , we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today .    3.334764560115102
finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented .    3.839753338062304
the effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper .    3.098094277660548
stress - related symptoms of family UNK of dementia patients have been proven in various studies .    3.772199481798157
for this group of people an analysis of the health UNK factors is regarded as to be especially important .    4.030100602317242
diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment ( by the caring person ) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health .    3.8505707528122324
in this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown .    3.3746541096957903
the causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after UNK ( lisfranc ) fracture - dislocation with the need for UNK arthrodesis are in our experience ( 22 cases over 5 years ) UNK injuries in one third , closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with k - wires in another two thirds of cases .    3.2575876855167625
foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight - bearing radiographs of both feet , adduction / abduction stress films and ct scans for complex deformity .    3.1042049439263852
correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions , strict UNK preparation and debridement of the lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage , sclerosis and fibrous tissue .    2.8071899080378264
reorientation begins , in the same manner as primary open reduction , with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second UNK .    4.2647585631557146
defects are filled with autologous bone grafting , stable fusion can be achieved with 3 . 5 mm cancellous compression screws .    3.7748462587882288
full weight bearing is allowed in a UNK plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks .    3.6078193916928494
the functional medium - term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow - up working full time .    3.400164362318552
the maryland foot score improved from 38 . 9 to 76 . 8 points in these patients .    3.3184222098802314
the author of this paper UNK it very necessary to UNK chinese tuina , a traditional chinese medical subject , so as to make chinese tuina conform to recent research results and formulation , as well as to combine chinese tuina with western manual medicine at the clinic .    3.1463094722841363
this paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in switzerland working together with prof . UNK UNK .    3.1689558556212005
the operability of a liver tumour depends on its three - dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define UNK functioning liver ( sub - ) segments .    3.1603350048170347
the aim of our study was to establish a computer - based three - dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver .    2.8853160924134817
methods : using data from routine helical ct scans the three tissue UNK of liver parenchyma , liver vessels and liver tumour were UNK UNK .    3.009966832082548
a dedicated UNK tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an " intelligent " border UNK .    3.2189592619323926
visualisation is performed by the " heidelberg UNK " .    4.144395226938204
the vascular trees are visualised as 3d graphs .    2.8374346614675616
UNK between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically .    3.123226994187943
security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal .    3.2793124825629
results : the 3d anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception .    3.1446678753050135
dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees .    3.705320725139105
the system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour , security margin and dependent liver parenchyma .    2.837544545939808
conclusion : three - dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology .    3.4298684806494384
virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols , which can be quantified and modified UNK .    3.3253820278965196
this will make operation planning more objective ; patient selection may be improved , and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested .    3.643468320619602
thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching , surgical training and planning .    3.0824738901513684
methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing .    3.627695986434722
p - wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting .    4.014588634653842
however , correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p - wave analysis with the high resolution ecg .    3.2292657649829697
signal averaging triggered to the p - wave is significantly superior to qrs - triggering .    3.2917352244198166
bidirectional filtering or UNK - filtering is necessary .    3.8399926293415736
the data indicate significant differences in p - wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation .    3.2539994192423767
class i antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p - wave duration , but did not influence spectral parameters .    3.1932479798380626
treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p - wave energy without altering p - wave duration .    3.083309530897325
after optimizing the methods , p - wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals .    3.2131997895844164
in addition , the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible .    3.8551525314412736
in the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit .    2.8011653495021367
these may be fatal in patients treated conservatively with anticoagulation only .    3.650449179124105
in literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4 % .    4.352545713386719
extremely mobile , long , UNK - shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus - related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40 % .    3.5334385792114302
current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation .    3.23799072268008
in the last years , several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris .    3.238513536061998
acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50 % in the first six months .    4.310385377870006
UNK has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase .    4.028582221424611
unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin .    3.1844075399329115
low molecular weight - heparin is at least as effective as uf - heparin .    2.9900376113049005
direct thrombin - inhibitors ( hirudin , hirudin - UNK ) seem to be comparable to uf - heparin .    3.4945195318889235
UNK - UNK should not be given in unstable angina , as they show a tendency to worsen the clinical outcome .    3.8533728066638715
gp iib / iiia - antagonists ( antibodies , synthetic antagonists ) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin .    3.001475237820909
when combined with a reduced dose of heparin , their favourable effect remains unchanged , while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum .    3.4277983461974117
the study presents data on cardiovascular malformations in bavarian UNK , born between 1984 and 1991 .    3.0422754954930276
cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children ' s hospital up to 2 years of age .    3.16862212016998
the classification scheme was based on abnormalities in developmental mechanisms .    3.4467113918921433
severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake , resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment .    2.9639237732073194
the patients become handicapped and have a poor prognosis .    2.922995571704073
we report on a now 13 - year - old UNK child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition .    2.8002615385352585
the teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years .    3.2992784051662993
this care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state , associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections .    3.559899929056532
although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive , with resulting UNK of the fingers , the child is socially well adjusted in school and family .    3.2769737970869297
its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management .    3.491873551671466
our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of UNK pylori .    3.1757530058280476
peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease .    3.271212233481807
h . pylori can be considered the pacemaker , with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation .    3.898437611217487
treatment of h . pylori in peptic ulcer disease UNK the acute lesion and prevents relapse and complications .    2.838340239340651
in clinical management a positive diagnosis of h . pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment .    3.1167902988861873
the standard treatment in h . pylori positive ulcer consists of ppi in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and UNK 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg ( or 500 mg ) for 7 days .    2.780629020217265
the simultaneous presence of h . pylori and nsaid intake requires distinct management .    2.943244866272354
following bleeding complication a ppi needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed .    3.1003300043135753
we present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the german workers ' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases .    3.515053670701982
the examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered UNK or luxation of the knee , fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits , calcaneus fractures , rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation , and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents .    3.910803076275452
a new documentation sheet was UNK to note administrative and medical data .    3.289476645921206
all 477 patients ' charts and x - rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons , and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner .    3.4461846245216465
the study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained , especially in the case of knee injuries .    3.397237572727324
the article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups .    3.5715644626992273
our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place .    3.4766412821275336
a workshop on attenuated cold - adapted influenza virus vaccines ( UNK ) was organized in UNK , germany on december 16 - 17 , 1998 by prof . UNK UNK , president of the paul ehrlich institute .    3.6661858102372467
reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance , in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy .    3.6405590898006
recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium - or free radical - mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia / reperfusion .    2.6743295636132993
the mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition ( pt ) during the reperfusion period , which is associated with UNK of mitochondrial respiration , loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , and a burst production of ros , leading to cellular death .    3.8841057573562603
the mitochondrial pt is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia , as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver .    3.4081834113850578
pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion .    3.344870138600929
we performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg / h UNK implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) .    3.243938111419675
the purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion ( plif ) by a finite element approach .    2.545666194787932
stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression ( 600 n ) , torsion ( 25 nm ) and shearing forces ( 250 n ) without preload .    3.1801044212008165
the results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of plif with two bak - cages and plif with two harms - cages and additional posterior screw - rod - osteosynthesis .    2.334118135780014
plif with two bak - cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression , torsion and shearing .    2.4663189887979353
plif with two harms - cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression , torsion and shearing .    2.4529477259139805
tramadol , an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used UNK for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain .    3.446040742716649
previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective UNK reuptake inhibitor ( ssri ) .    2.937923408774957
therefore , its major mode of action may be questioned which UNK is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake .    3.5994908431943453
aim : the cause of a connatal hemiplegia was retrospectivly investigated in children born at term .    3.065536270549758
first forensic cases were solved by the use of UNK UNK in the UNK century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years .    4.035208513020054
in europe , mainly french , UNK , english and scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods .    3.3206384283183654
in france , an entomological police laboratory has been set up in UNK - UNK - bois .    3.8222004259234987
in contrast to the united states of america where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts , the method has only just started to be accepted in germany .    2.848138614899904
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis ( scc ) and / or UNK UNK ( pao ) were examined with whole body scintigraphy , conventional radiography , and other imaging modalities , such as ct , mri .    4.077643945363172
25 of 27 patients with scch showed a characteristic high bullhorn - like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the UNK UNK representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns ( = bullhorn - sign ) .    3.1598123735903987
scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations ( spondylitis , UNK , osteitis , UNK ) in 19 of the 27 patients with scch and / or pao .    4.368838152895332
in combination with ppp or psoriasis UNK , the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of pao ( 19 patients ) with high confidence .    4.156184060624767
patients with scch but without skin disease at the time of presentation ( 8 of 27 patients ) may develop ppp later and , therefore , it is justified to classify them as incomplete pao with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease .    3.2234922399878605
UNK stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male , and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng / ml ( 300 ng / dl or 12 UNK / l ) , and with symptoms varying according to the individual .    3.5834139389286253
the symptoms are a reduction or even loss of UNK , a decline in muscle mass and strength , enhancement of visceral fatty tissue - UNK , UNK of the skin , apathy , tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression , and UNK due to osteoporosis .    4.019917311593696
a 34 year - old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the UNK , the dorsum of the hands and the UNK region .    3.9913661708005295
she was in good health and her family history was unremarkable .    3.087616444359763
histologic examination of the UNK patches revealed pigmented UNK UNK of the UNK epidermis and follicular UNK , as well as small epithelial cysts .    4.7026653369935545
upon immunohistochemical and ultrastructural studies , the number of melanocytes appeared normal .    3.7712394126070814
the elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes .    2.8854264185097134
in the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not UNK into complexes .    3.309860735795433
the diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established .    2.9815615549542516
the knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate UNK with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance .    3.0515507848897254
genital or UNK pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from UNK of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans .    4.036547621981747
the presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis .    2.7867349513115034
purpose : during the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life ( qol ) data regarding surgical treatment .    3.09785803867762
methods : the present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required nissen fundoplication of 70 patients .    3.380329025889141
therefore , the german gastrointestinal quality of life index ( giqli ) was used to UNK the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year .    3.5495789465223035
results : preoperatively , we found a low general giqli score ( mean 92 . 7 points ) , which increased 6 weeks postoperatively ( 116 . 8 points ) , 3 months ( 124 . 8 ) and 1 year ( mean 123 . 9 points ) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population ( 122 . 6 points ) .    3.694763909543214
conclusion : it is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using qol .    3.6092123502861164
introduction : serous UNK of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign .    4.091907965321146
methods : we report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors .    3.7780003333790746
results : between october 1993 and december 1998 , 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection ; in 12 cases ( 11 women , 1 man ) a serous cystadenoma ( 10 UNK , 2 UNK ) was found .    3.3601686578849415
only 6 ( 50 % ) patients had symptoms .    3.861107454254585
the mean tumor size was 4 . 8 ( 2 . 7 - 10 ) cm .    4.146022956851351
ultrasound , ct and mrt usually could detect the mass , but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable .    3.3868631487313663
all tumors were resected : 4 whipple procedures , 7 distal UNK and 1 segmental resection were performed .    3.065000728289811
no patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on .    3.6374040153210374
conclusions : because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas , we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected .    3.50101516445661
we examined the prevalence of hiv - associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of uv - radiation in hiv - infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of UNK patients seen between and 1994 and 1996 .    3.8357961102860942
41 patients were treated with uvb - radiation and 4 patients with uva1 - radiation , while three patients received puva - therapy .    3.6325786344468
uv - radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption , atopic dermatitis and psoriasis .    3.3795105642401424
although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of uv radiation on the UNK of hiv - positive patients , no progression of the hiv infection due to phototherapy has been proven .    3.4918869637900536
the staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation .    3.0340258374875546
this applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories .    2.918636557695616
in this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions .    2.8748010316175843
it could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x - ray tube .    3.480316815394994
the effective dose for the physician wearing a lead UNK and thyroid shield was UNK to about 1 . 7 msva .    3.480328155736197
without a thyroid shield an effective dose of about 3 . 5 msva resulted .    3.527213657325842
this corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2 . 4 msva in the federal republic of germany .    3.037565402262761
from the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1 - 2 UNK per application for the physician , averaged over all types of procedures .    3.6684557766107337
further , it could be shown that the readings of the film badges , usually UNK by the staff , UNK the effective dose by approximately a factor of two .    3.1950566042375765
this is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the UNK parts of the body to effective dose .    3.4036722065813536
from the estimated annual effective dose , a lifetime dose of 68 msv was estimated for a 40 - year working career .    2.882906914459971
the corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0 . 3 % applying the UNK risk factor of 4 - 10 - 2 sv - 1 .    3.6103241609252543
considering the UNK recommendations for a safe occupation , working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures .    3.2692270019970353
treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care .    3.8006925107972993
one therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin ( pgi2 ) .    2.884850642538774
this , however , is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction , reduced arterial oxygenation , and systemic vasodilation .    3.517403603053265
thus , its clinical usefulness is limited .    3.208592464440466
however , the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide ( no ) or UNK pgi2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange , without any systemic vasodilation .    2.6264444234507924
it has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions .    3.801567538799305
however , the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects : in the case of no , toxic side effects are predominant ( UNK , UNK ) , whereas in the case of pgi2 , technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest .    3.7455495323960157
furthermore , some patients do not respond to the treatment .    3.123343007223511
in some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen , while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation .    3.506474355127221
the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated .    3.214102330217682
the treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of UNK placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery .    3.1880998555615805
in the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases .    3.2409302767060484
the rate of clinical success , meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm , cannot ( yet ) be definitively determined , since no long - term results are so far available .    3.219800382117795
secondary leaks are observed in at least 10 % of all patients , making a further therapy necessary ( UNK , conversion , embolization ) .    3.976119030903851
further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal / iliac attachment of the prostheses , a better configuration and the development of long - lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses .    3.8237619007999424
the frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 g UNK needles is reported at 59 - 85 % .    2.8173858129961853
a case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described .    2.817694177090424
a 30 - year - old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour .    3.2623309791866184
conservative therapy for 3 days and 4 days of bedrest followed by UNK infusions during a 3 - week hospital stay and a subsequent 3 - week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief .    3.5449906775147344
intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by cct .    3.3547531958014396
a pathologic eeg was not confirmed by cranial mrt .    3.1388371486134305
a lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at l3 / 4 .    3.3043112697558006
the patient stayed in bed for 12 h . after 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache .    3.12268909533842
because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a mrt was performed , which showed the blood at l4 to s3 in the epidural space .    3.362268280597577
the diagnosis of a cerebrospinal fluid leakage was based on the history and the main symptom of postspinal headache : the pain onset in the supine position .    3.2330623577812996
such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest , increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions , increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed .    2.716943889073117
the average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93 % .    3.0632243649686157
volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood .    3.423670049449287
we chose 15 ml of blood , to take account of the possibility that blood might UNK in the wide sacral space .    3.8080352459403746
we were able to document the position of the blood patch as l4 to s3 on mr tomography ( the injection site was l3 / 4 ) .    3.0417365329336326
most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch .    3.1938090345951173
our patient had to be confined to bed for another 48 h because of recurring headache .    3.2461429791959997
the blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage .    3.047615499561417
on the other hand , the leak was probably only diminished because of the blood patch descending down to the wide sacral space .    2.817946673831753
the combination of the large - volume blood patch , which diminished the leakage , and conservative treatment , which narrowed the UNK pressure difference , was successful : the 6 - week postspinal headache was cured .    3.1795363988183665
prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch .    3.268529464032932
the use of over 10 ml cannot be generally recommended , although in this case most of the blood patch of 15 ml was localized UNK .    3.669117612028
careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml .    3.187064620743414
if there is no immediate relief , conservative therapy with 24 - 48 h of bedrest is recommended .    3.10198374565123
if the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed , with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account .    3.8682220312237554
after a 3 - to 4 - week titration period , carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily , or the highest dose tolerated ( at least UNK daily ) .    3.245223742012041
maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks .    3.5962644246734192
digital 24 - hour holter recordings were obtained at baseline and after 8 weeks of carvedilol therapy .    3.200758338907832
hrv for the entire 24 - hour period was computed in the time domain using the oxford medilog excel 2 analysis system .    3.259392865473281
measures of hrv included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats ( UNK ) , the standard deviation of all normal rr intervals ( sdnn ) , the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal rr intervals ( rmssd ) , and the proportion of adjacent normal rr intervals differing > UNK ( UNK ) .    3.506696715748838
the histologic determination of the degree of tissue UNK and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features ( nuclear UNK , mitoses , endothelial proliferation , tumor necrosis ) .    3.475556136692273
this grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist , especially concerning the weighting of criteria ( UNK , moderate , pronounced ) .    3.532544604218785
an observer - independent approach seems to be feasible by UNK the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an UNK approach UNK only the presence or absence of these structure parameters .    3.7169382561875017
this grading procedure is recognized in the revised who classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas ( UNK .    3.1009616846961037
our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas .    2.7699708756306447
our recent investigations on glioma grading showed , both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas , that a two - UNK grading scheme distinguishing only " low - grade " and " high - grade " cases was prognostically relevant .    3.4362366833188918
for all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in ct and mri seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the " high " malignancy grade .    3.5623985636455253
in patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease , who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery , transmyocardial laser revascularization ( tmr ) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity .    3.0901452946022974
one UNK of tmr is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial UNK of the heart .    4.096123280686195
therefore , a catheter - based system has been developed , which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity .    3.2488725862211236
several phase iii studies have proven that the beta - UNK have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis .    3.1754244467131487
recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta - 1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published .    3.470947546168069
in a multicenter , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study UNK patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale ( edss ) value between 3 . 0 and 6 . 5 were treated with either 8 UNK .    3.080565357833815
interferon beta - 1b or placebo subcutaneously every second day for two to three years .    2.8087038462125182
the primary study end - point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as UNK by a one point increase of the edss value ( for initial edss values between 3 . 0 and 5 . 5 ) or 0 . 5 point increase when the initial edss value was between 6 . 0 and 6 . 5 .    3.9266314237560187
after two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group ( p = 0 . 0008 ) .    3.2442088723372504
to test the effect of UNK on UNK or UNK function .    4.89809394781621
cases of female patients who UNK having been sexually abused by their fathers during ( early ) childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed .    2.8067331180372035
as a result of projection and counter transference the therapist developes feelings of UNK , UNK and of being involved in a " hysterical theatre performance " so that this UNK of therapy is very difficult to UNK and carry out .    3.7123555043655685
on the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses : 1 ) the incest - phantasy is a UNK attempt ; 2 ) the incest - phantasy is a symbolic representation ; 3 ) in the sense of a symbolic wish - UNK included in the parent - child - interaction .    3.0592353190075015
after this , an attempt is being made to examine in various therapeutical scenes the role of these UNK during the transference UNK and finally to UNK diagnostic criteria with which these patients can be differentiated from others with definitely witnessed sexual abuse cases so that consequently treatment techniques can be devised in future .    3.2767354559993733
hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections ( surveillance ) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies ( § 23 abs .    2.8894248017136435
1 UNK = infection prevention act ) .    3.1853347507088405
the nosocomial infections to be recorded , i . e device associated infections and postsurgical UNK , have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections .    3.4221005902592156
important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance .    3.517493618452207
most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical UNK laboratory but shall be collected , listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics .    3.04584041958903
both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like mrsa . they are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 sgb v .    3.333424997221155
nasopharyngeal carcinomas ( npc ) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world , e . g . , south - east asia , while they occur infrequently in western europe .    3.189278098080852
the association of npcs with epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , a transforming human herpes virus , is well established .    2.927979975808771
the current who classification UNK two major npc UNK , non - keratinising npc and squamous cell npc .    3.286146093671339
ebv is invariably present in non - keratinising npcs and the viral UNK lmp - 1 ( latent membrane protein - 1 ) is expressed in some cases .    3.703278614013521
the tumour cells of non - keratinising npcs show phenotypic features which are inducible by lmp - 1 in vitro .    2.940854015433155
these may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type .    3.50015613482361
furthermore , the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ .    2.574817496984247
thus , the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of non - keratinising npcs .    3.240727348514687
by contrast , the association of squamous cell npcs with ebv displays a geographical variability .    3.080345098247113
it appears , therefore , that squamous cell npcs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non - keratinising npcs .    3.0014652065232585
to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low - grade glioma .    3.0383389542232204
between UNK and 1996 , 45 patients with astrocytoma , 14 with UNK and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 gy ( range , 45 to 61 gy ) .    3.4075781288563625
sixty - seven patients were treated immediately following surgery , 10 patients with tumor progression .    3.8116240422949605
the influence of various factors including histology , gender , age , seizures , duration of symptoms ( < = 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks ) , ct pattern ( enhancement vs no enhancement ) , type of surgery , total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse - free survival and overall survival was investigated .    3.198893188598791
the median overall survival time was 81 month , the 5 - and 10 - year survival rates were 54 % and 31 % , respectively .    3.2733236006391437
the median time to progression was 56 months , while the 5 - and 10 - year progression - free survival rates were 45 % and 24 % .    3.1064732146280956
univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose ( p = 0 . 01 ) , duration of symptoms ( p = 0 . 05 ) , the presence of seizures ( p = 0 . 04 ) , and the ct pattern following intravenous contrast ( p = 0 . 005 ) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival .    3.599329802802046
progression - free survival rates were influenced by the total dose ( p = 0 . 04 ) , the duration of symptoms ( p = 0 . 01 ) and ct pattern ( p = 0 . 006 ) .    3.5723796606685765
a minimum total dose of 52 gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low - grade glioma .    3.4089546302763196
tumors with ct enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment .    2.938286655970535
we report three patients with severe guillain - barré syndrome ( gbs ) .    3.034392757578043
on clinical examination , no sensory deficit was elicited .    3.6078948021676203
electromyography ( emg ) and motor nerve conduction velocity ( ncv ) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion .    3.0299691533951396
in two patients , we found total peripheral conduction block without UNK emg activity .    3.4536775423456803
sensory ncv and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal .    3.00652258047528
sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers , some in the form of primary UNK .    3.0591690076626734
therefore , these cases must UNK classified as combined motor - sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings .    3.247486134668253
although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred , causing UNK , this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant .    3.376770282261604
in contrast to positive reports in literature , immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases .    2.9629780561014285
do hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer ?    3.5571035186689404
epidemiological data on hcv transmission in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding hcv positive individuals from working as food handlers in general .    3.208797570416572
such restrictions seem to be justified only if hcv infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding .    3.173135695677163
only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex .    3.0774221574058194
to demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study .    3.3001082970797477
dementia - screening in clinical routine requires short , sensitive and specific tools .    3.452478834933622
a number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose .    3.9273525806501453
the present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia - screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy .    3.165816125980031
a UNK report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology .    3.4228166345429365
the most important , reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic UNK and ascending pressure phlebography , as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made .    3.274080912431205
additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour - coded duplex sonography .    2.9108245544083142
a UNK condition should always be investigated in terms of UNK .    3.619130289888583
in patients with severe post - thrombotic disease , a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with , and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography and , if possible , dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination .    3.8303911439054827
there is currently no generally valid UNK of the post - thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion .    3.4914759419859087
when evaluating patients , we largely follow our own new classification , which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis .    3.1383402563627563
since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics ( dnpu ) has so far been rather ineffective , recent reports of successful management of dnpu by short - term retrograde transvenous leg UNK ( rvp ) by south american UNK encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic dnpu .    2.9589945926397663
hence , in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from dnpu with the same daily doses of netilmycin , administered either in systemic venous infusions ( svi : n = 21 , three times / day ) or in rvp ( n = 24 , once / day ) .    3.5106947320288993
after 10 consecutive days of treatment , ulcers had closed in 8 of the 24 patients treated with rvp , as against 3 of the 21 treated with svi .    3.3742971420079124
diminution of the ulcer area by > 30 % including full debridement was achieved in 10 / 24 of the rvp cases ( svi : 4 / 21 ) .    3.216422336950951
during 6 months of follow - up , amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the rvp group , but in 4 in the svi group .    3.761456909392074
partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after rvp .    3.8726467595870027
our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the rvp procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by svi for the treatment of dnpu .    3.0821343872327023
rvp can be recommended in dnpu , particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections .    3.4904490423633896
there is hardly any other discipline that illustrates the conflict between the freedom of science and research , that is to say , ultimately , what is medically possible , and human dignity and the protection of life or , in other words , what can be justified in ethical or legal terms , so clearly as reproduction medicine .    2.9467973152210827
the topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum , ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective UNK , the many questions raised by assisted fertilization , and especially by anonymous sperm donation , and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation , to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis , some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts .    3.5450854037755315
in a good many of these sectors it is difficult to UNK what doctors can do and what it is UNK for them to do , so that it is hardly surprising that there is often no general consensus .    3.40963752538972
against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important , and the UNK in this paper , which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue , are intended to stimulate such discussion .    3.610045807458828
in mr - imaging , similar to computed tomography , diagnosis of metastatic lymph - node disease is based on lymph - node sizes , and thereby it is non - specific .    4.095634264628575
superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for mr - lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic , interstitial and , in case of very small particles , after intravenous injection .    3.3426259069814797
no accumulation UNK in lymph node metastases .    3.419359685372227
lymph - node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques .    3.658023645457099
it has been shown experimentally , that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes .    3.1909924295607386
the experimental results with endolymphatic , interstitial , and intravenous mr - lymphography as well as first clinical results with intravenous contrast medium injection are presented and discussed .    3.2309874492702364
the purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal UNK due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles .    2.928920777878052
in 1993 , we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty ( tap ) of the thoraco - abdominal aortic segment iii / iv in chronic - expanding type b aortic dissection ( cead ) to achieve 2 primary goals : 1 . reduction of renal / visceral and spinal cord ischemic time ; 2 . safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications , i . e . paraplegia , kidney failure , and intestinal infarction .    3.071738752684761
among 71 UNK aortic reconstructions since 1993 , 5 cead patients ( median age 47 . 8 UNK , mean cead - 6 . 5 cm , 4 with marfan syndrome ) underwent tap .    3.624934727698103
selection criteria are : 1 .    3.744666321711059
tap consists of : 1 . left posterolateral UNK from th 8 - l 2 , 2 . excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane ( s ) 3 . aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension .    3.3706656970778255
all 5 patients survived without any major complications , particularly no paraplegia .    3.4159541998211918
mean cross - clamping was 43 min .    3.249181223237955
after 7 months , 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line .    3.2217380844752563
after mean follow - up of 2 . 4 years , ct - angiography revealed a stable tap segment ( mean aortic - 3 . 2 cm ) in 4 patients and one re - expanded tap segment ( from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm ) without signs of re - dissection .    3.628920659694814
our 4 - year - results ( 1 ) UNK the UNK UNK data .    6.049891834346479
although one re - expanded tap segment is UNK , we found the short - term gains so UNK to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients .    3.219955488418868
all optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric UNK in common which is attached to four ligands , that can have different three dimensional positions .    3.1490842383104014
therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane - polarized light .    2.92207666132249
when the UNK and its corresponding UNK are present in equal proportions , they are called racemic mixture , a mixture that does not rotate polarized light , since the optical activities of the two isomers UNK each other .    3.4934403367817906
although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed UNK .    2.5146077862322893
the human body comprises a UNK environment due to optically active proteins ; thus it is not surprising that UNK drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties , when used as pure optical isomers .    3.0056025057522873
till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers , which are mainly used as racemic mixture ( 1 : 1 mixture ) .    3.5661046559923975
for financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes , but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is UNK feasible due to new production techniques .    2.8931126673030234
the terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug .    3.3054046991131747
the clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable , if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects .    2.8553352774056537
among the modern anaesthetics ketamine , isoflurane , bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon .    2.8039716037733946
for most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects .    2.7892754440164023
for volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered , since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far .    3.2473814686100195
the high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in UNK and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial UNK suggest a genetic disposition of this disease .    3.9064459532073665
our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease .    2.9947177724925846
we included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and UNK in this study .    3.4973995477808306
controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ent clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance ( n = 52 ) .    3.6150914305913155
the application of a tryptophan - free amino acid mixture ( tryptophan depletion test ) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan .    2.903659761476958
consequently , the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased .    2.9425240213903034
this method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the UNK of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities .    4.051283747754355
untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion .    3.08619375578642
in depressed patients during an antidepressant or light - therapy - induced stable remission , a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion .    3.076206261751921
healthy subjects with a genetic risk for affective disorder show worsening of their condition induced by tryptophan depletion .    3.1306330914925664
these findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants .    3.2536376067149306
since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression , it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non - depressed patients .    3.6193139662674154
several common chronic pain syndromes come to the attention of the UNK demanding for differentiation from fibromyalgia ( fm ) , although they are often associated with it .    3.6515473527310838
they may UNK fm by ( 1 ) the occurance of wide spread pain , ( 2 ) the chronicity of complaints , ( 3 ) the preponderance of females in some of these , and ( 4 ) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests .    3.5664977299510383
pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ( " dysfunctional syndromes " , UNK , UNK .    3.7872009779993343
recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper - and UNK syndromes ; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function .    3.8754387750503154
in addition , the skin needs to be examined to detect UNK ( also called " cellulitis " ) , which may be mixed up with fm due to its preferential occurance in peri - or postmenopausal women .    3.384032936935395
it is concluded that the UNK differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding fm and all studies dealing with fm .    3.0946566338090356
in a prospective , randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia ( ldl cholesterol > = 130 < = UNK / dl ) , we compared the effect of an early - initiated , intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events .    3.5579654908464433
patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and / or ptca because of severe / instable angina pectoris .    3.436426075084573
the intensified therapy consisted of UNK 20 - UNK with addition of UNK and / or nicotinic acid , if necessary , to achieve an ldl cholesterol < = UNK / dl .    4.056005606747787
in the control group , antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician .    3.161385688125063
multiple sclerosis is a rare disease in childhood .    3.4596943773319917
a 10 1 / 2 year old girl developed a rapidly ongoing paresis of the right leg accompanied by paresthesia , sphincter incompetence and retrobulbar neuritis .    3.357096415356376
abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty .    3.206942564908381
despite increasing operator experience and improved technology , abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty .    3.288515554257676
intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the gp iib / iiia receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem .    3.0424530926085165
about 50 % of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction , necessity of cabg or death occurring in up to 10 % of acute occlusions .    3.3286567282991584
the purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure .    3.060152389766068
since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the UNK dose , the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build - up region is necessary for high - energy photon beams .    3.1207842669082515
in this study the beam UNK affecting the build - up and skin dose for 6 - and 18 - mv photons are analyzed .    2.6951511843132585
measurements were made with 6 - and 18 - mv photons using a UNK parallel - plate ionization chamber ( UNK - 036 ) and a UNK - UNK UNK .    3.475863586960125
build - up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm UNK phantom with a fixed ssd of 100 cm .    3.0180158297728235
the entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a 45 ° wedge .    2.8592099801492115
exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top , 1 . 0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1 . 0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments .    3.1170154730052895
it was observed that the UNK decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators .    3.40906614252475
for both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size .    3.1197679212831493
it was also noticed that the dose in the build - up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose .    2.8149406673625554
the data show that the tray UNK factor ( tpf ) at surface decreases steadily with tray - surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes .    2.7324852268205304
it was noted that the tpf was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray - surface distances for both energies .    2.588787686339978
at tray - surface distances above 60 cm the tpf almost remained close to unity for 6 - mv photons for all field sizes , whereas the continuous decrease in tpf could be noted for 18 - mv photon beams even after the tpf UNK unity .    2.9603732146704242
the increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron UNK from the UNK materials .    3.368884875706104
the use of wedge filters UNK low - energy scattered electrons UNK and hence , the relative surface dose ( rsd ) is always less than unity .    2.960592931438819
the increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium .    2.7327873834258303
we investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet ( diet i ) adapted to nutritional habits in germany .    2.7695997782255044
data were compared to a low fat diet ( diet ii ) according to the american heart association .    3.1614551476018327
the study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease ( 30 males and 7 females , age 45 - 83 yrs ) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments .    3.283330175941731
daily fat intake was UNK ( 24 % of energy intake of 6 . UNK / d ) in diet i and 60g ( 31 % of 7 . UNK / d ) in diet ii ( p < 0 . 01 ) , respectively .    3.2632126322384565
when compared with UNK , in dieti the intake of cholesterol , saturated and UNK fatty acids , vit .    3.3643075551880885
b12 were all reduced ( p < 0 . 01 ) , whereas the uptake of vit .    3.438201161096329
c was increased p < 0 . 01 .    3.723498644478702
the intake of folic acid was low in both groups .    3.0192142694430557
both diets resulted in a decrease in bmi , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , plasma cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels .    3.3118279733661935
concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dieti but hdl cholesterol levels remained unchanged .    2.9608803851539123
reduction of bmi and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline bmi and cholesterol concentrations , respectively .    2.792468417906525
the cholesterol lowering effect of diet i is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet .    3.387396346261001
taking into account the nutritional habits in germany , very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value .    3.2777056194495118
both diets are effective in lowering body weight , plasma cholesterol and UNK levels without affecting hdl cholesterol .    2.9124718826245903
these effects are most pronounced in overweight and UNK patients .    3.352339900020773
besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro - fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium , no assured clinical evidence of UNK right ventricular dysplasia - cardiomyopathy ( arvd ) exists yet .    2.9867267585413755
criteria for the clinical diagnosis of avrd were complied in 1994 by members of the isfc work group and the european association for cardiology .    3.4156032182874934
these criteria include structural , functional , histological , and electrophysiological abnormalities , which were divided into major and minor criteria .    3.285794311147652
global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients ( 83 % ) using angiography or electrocardiography .    3.6133734358187843
four patients ( 16 % ) exhibited only minor criteria in the UNK UNK or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular .    4.198802203894294
in all patients , the typical UNK replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined .    3.2188704673773705
t - inversion in the right UNK leads were present in 17 patients ( 71 % ) .    3.9498196197127844
a localized qrs - widening of more than UNK in v1 to UNK in 8 patients ( 33 % ) and an UNK wave in 6 patients ( 25 % ) were observed as major criteria .    3.9946813204555722
a late potential analysis using signal averaged ecg was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases ( 50 % ) in the sense of minor criteria .    3.6155469471540718
left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia , which was classified as a minor criterion , was observed in 23 patients ( 96 % ) ; only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure .    3.7997660001849147
a previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients ( 15 % ) .    3.025803650495815
the complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of avrd led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease , whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard .    4.050271121831499
without inclusion of histological data , the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases .    4.247182786150769
the question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible .    2.8190245732607546
subungual keratoacanthomas ( ska ) differ in clinical presentation , biological behaviour and the therapy needed from keratoacanthomas in other localizations .    3.208467232139212
against the backdrop of two personal observations and a review of the literature , the authors describe clinical and histological features and also the differential diagnosis and therapy and this rare benign neoplasm .    3.4459914815728183
patients present with a rapidly growing , painful subungual mass , which causes destruction of the underlying bone and usually does not UNK spontaneously .    3.6784166188621903
histological differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma is essential as the prognosis and treatment are different .    4.038109549160203
however , persistent recurrences after subtotal excision often necessitate amputation of the distal phalanx .    3.199240261346068
UNK and UNK are important mediators of inflammation .    3.439547435163357
while UNK synthesis can be influenced by nsaids therapeutical approaches to the 5 - UNK pathway are rare .    3.570705229624935
UNK extracts of UNK UNK ( h15 , UNK UNK ) , known from traditional UNK medicine , decrease UNK synthesis in vitro .    4.207950431641018
case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug .    3.246234333951099
methods : outpatients with active ra have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial .    2.8259746804034562
patients received 9 tablets of active drug ( 3600 mg ) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy .    3.432290052230585
doses of nsaids could be adjusted on demand .    3.435307617325031
efficacy parameters , UNK index for swelling and pain , esr , crp , pain on vas and nsaid dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation .    3.139466261620348
mean values and UNK were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation .    2.4615239771074204
results : a total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers , the data have been published in UNK .    3.5679142437433735
only 37 patients ( verum 18 , placebo 19 ) , enrolled in ratingen were available for UNK efficacy and safety analysis .    3.193754134782492
all evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator ( g . h . ) .    3.7278107308497983
there was no subjective , clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation .    2.10648677281547
one patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened .    3.644837210711606
the others showed no alteration of their disease .    3.141476896098562
conclusion : treatment with h15 showed no measurable efficacy .    2.9212834947483297
controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results .    3.3391340520145665
a 61 - year - old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light - exposed areas after taking st . john ' s wort - extract for three years .    2.542560481388012
routine UNK did not reveal any relevant reactions and UNK testing was negative .    3.0905003968190328
using a systemic oral UNK test with st . john ' s wort , we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the med - uvb which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication .    2.8237412135891717
due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques .    2.8407184106064967
high flow phases for wash - in or wash - out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short , the difference between the volatile ' s concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small , and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia .    3.3759783687916194
the monitoring , required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients , corresponds to the current UNK technical safety standards .    3.715120593632207
as compound a may accumulate in the breathing system , sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1 . 0 l / min , until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved .    3.310375660194675
low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash - out of trace gases .    3.1124432746925113
the gaseous degradation products are UNK and possibly may be harmful to the patients .    3.3640621490949756
only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and UNK acceptable range of efficiency .    3.5528206755118434
cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction .    3.012754820587237
the typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk .    3.6591133654324812
immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or ptca can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients .    3.3927951056437298
patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic UNK in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion .    3.002812126214429
several non - randomized studies suggest that ptca is superior to thrombolysis in patients with shock and ongoing ischemia .    3.688143943282919
however , aortic counterpulsation may enhance reperfusion rates achieved by thrombolytic therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock .    3.1211382741268956
early surgery is required in patients with shock due to mechanical complications , such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum .    4.0739341937930815
ventricular assist devices can be used in selected patients with refractory shock as a bridge to cardiac transplantation .    3.4227803431361328
right atrial thrombi are rare , but potentially life - threatening complications of UNK UNK .    3.2793594105148185
we report on a 4 . 6 year old girl , presenting with signs of subacute valve malfunction ; in her cerebrospinal fluid UNK - negative staphylococcus could be cultured , and the cf protein was elevated .    3.3889428914066984
UNK echocardiography demonstrated a large thrombus on the distal part of the shunt .    3.618645969848913
the thrombus UNK into the right ventricle during UNK .    3.7832130569248363
the child underwent UNK and thrombectomy .    3.408025300847882
object of this review is to present the physiological principles , diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis .    3.6449397131183883
despite intense research activities in this area , many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear .    3.3547094434735354
beside an impaired regional perfusion also disturbances in the cellular oxygen utilization may be responsible for organ failure in sepsis .    3.339768966869087
until now , it was not shown , whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients .    3.472721105757554
it is also unknown , which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients .    3.4071416990052765
in future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy .    3.5753790244313333
a new nasogastric balloon tube has been developed , which will prevent the reflux of gastric contents by blocking the cardia with a balloon .    2.816960801863607
it was the aim of this initial study to assess the efficiency of the tube in animals , healthy volunteers and patients .    3.4937752499127623
with the approval of the animal ethics committee , a total of 16 anaesthetised pigs were used for the animal experiments .    3.361225971465951
balloon occlusion of the cardia was performed in 10 pigs .    4.2743338759436975
six further pigs with an unblocked cardia served as controls .    2.7898165276886377
vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different UNK while the gastro - oesophageal ( lower oesophageal ) sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope .    2.929718882504565
with local ethics committee approval and informed written consent , ( 1 ) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake , healthy adult volunteers ( 10 females , 6 males , 29 + / - 4 years ) with a fluid - filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia , while intragastric pressure was monitored , and ( 2 ) 30 patients ( 21 - 89 years ) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon .    3.5584722694833704
pigs ( n = 10 ) with a blocked cardia showed no UNK reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation , while 28 of the 36 UNK manipulations induced reflux in pigs ( n = 6 ) with an unblocked cardia .    3.5729271164515612
among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia ( n = 16 ) , reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting .    3.104810614052703
after termination of the occlusion of the cardia , reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers .    3.110192748619119
in 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without UNK any problems .    3.0146126515969254
the average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was 164 + / - 8 s . conclusions .    3.3165074171546642
it is concluded from the present results , with further clinical studies pending , that the gastric balloon probe permits low - risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase .    3.6956695214345574
the article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by UNK and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive - UNK theories and therapeutic techniques .    3.3294617604561023
the basic assumption is : pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals .    3.059295825218831
in psychotherapy , the patient works to UNK pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist .    3.652528704713097
in this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences .    2.7993787587082033
the theory is supported by numerous empirical studies .    3.1502739468892313
treatment with " nootropic drugs " of patients suffering from dementia is often described as arbitrary .    3.423172882118558
to define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs , effects and side effects , economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied .    3.6003070760576135
a summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in UNK the progress of the disease .    3.3231313264450826
the majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects .    3.0300868325760044
there are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects .    3.242708562337559
delayed admission to care units leads to a UNK - ve cost effect of nootropics .    3.944410356770492
better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment .    3.25072677243305
a proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data .    3.220780854410255
purpose : to evaluate the efficacy of high - dose gd - dtpa - UNK ( UNK , UNK ) as a contrast for magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and the use of high - dose dynamic studies for predicting the response to preoperative chemotherapy .    4.0125964008553465
simulation has gained an important role in medical education and continuing education in the field of anaesthesia and emergency medicine .    3.885037982791061
this article gives background information on how full - scale simulators are applied in medical education as well as in continuing education for advanced anesthesia and scientific applications .    3.101863515239069
acceptance of training seems enhanced by inclusion of the human factor aspect , since this has proven to be a major source for the development of critical situations in our specialty .    4.048446677777536
furthermore , drawbacks of the simulators available and the current training availability in germany is described .    3.0069610339391
we evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure ( ptio2 ) and global cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) during cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( dhca ) in ten anesthetized new UNK white rabbits ( body weight 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 5 kg ) .    2.9343959511893964
cbf [ hydrogen desaturation ( clearance ) - technique ) and ptio2 ( UNK - UNK ) right UNK cortex ] were determined .    3.507919415816228
after median sternotomy , the animals were placed on cpb ( standard UNK pump , UNK , - UNK acid - base management , perfusion flow of 180 - 200 ml / kg / min , right atrial and aortic cannulation ) for induction of dhca by cooling to 15 °c rectal temperature ( 1 °c per minute ) .    3.2583281095654626
rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from cpb without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support .    3.1707540704429764
under baseline conditions , ptio2 was 38 + / - 5 mmhg and did not change significantly before dhca .    3.0668411030394465
during dhca the ptio2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 + / - 5 mmhg , after 30 minutes to 5 + / - 1 mmhg and after 40 minutes to zero .    3.239590803232719
neither the ptio2 nor cbf recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion : ptio2 ( 25 + / - 4 mmhg vs . baseline : 38 + / - 5 mmhg , p < 0 . 05 ) and cbf ( 43 + / - 8 vs . baseline : 68 + / - 11 ml / 100 g / min , p < 0 . 05 ) were significantly reduced .    3.065698647173932
arterial and jugular - venous lactate levels increased after rewarming ( p < 0 . 05 ) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism .    2.855873793028431
these data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptio2 ( brain tissue oxygenation ) and cbf ( oxygen supply ) during and after rewarming from dhca .    2.913385642051562
the induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low - flow situation with delayed brain tissue UNK on the cellular / mitochondrial level .    3.4553777605614893
thus , a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the UNK during cpb , resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution , mitochondrial dysfunction and / or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption ( compensation of an oxygen UNK ) is a possible explanation .    3.431475150851827
while initially advocated primarily for UNK visualization ( e . g . , craniotomy ) , interventional mri rapidly evolved into roles in image - guided localization for needle - based procedures , minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures , and thermal ablation of cancer .    2.831343868302622
in this UNK , mri pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles : ( 1 ) speed improvement , ( 2 ) device localization , ( 3 ) anatomy / lesion differentiation and ( 4 ) temperature sensitivity .    3.3477191066979173
a 74 - years old patient is admitted to the hospital with a over a period of 4 years growing , scrotal , UNK tumor .    3.3413552836196354
there is no connection to the testicle or the UNK palpable .    3.2334489582809582
all laboratory findings including the UNK are normal .    3.9457016961109983
the scrotal sonography shows a solid tumor , that is filled with vessels in the doppler sonography .    3.305925779736634
the complete tumor resection with histological examination leads to the diagnosis of a scrotal leiomyoma .    3.727579580367802
this rare , benign tumor is a differential diagnosis to UNK or non - UNK tumors .    4.338814013411307
this review summarizes vascular tumours of skin and soft tissues that have been characterised in recent years .    3.0088562839358204
although most of them are very rare , knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls .    3.330695213517086
these lesions include : UNK angiomatosis , a UNK , UNK infection of immunocompromised patients caused by UNK UNK ; tufted angioma , a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a " UNK - ball " distribution of multiple UNK composed of packed capillaries and UNK ; UNK haemangioma , a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin - walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen ; UNK haemangioma , a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well - differentiated angiosarcoma ; " hobnail haemangioma " ( targetoid UNK haemangioma ) , a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail UNK of the prominent endothelial tumour cells ; retiform haemangioendothelioma , a very recently characterised low - grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by UNK blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail - like prominent endothelial cells ; kaposi - like infantile haemangioendothelioma , a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking kaposi ' s sarcoma histologically ; epithelioid angiosarcoma , a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers ; benign lymph - UNK ( progressive UNK ) , a benign , slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well - differentiated angiosarcoma and kaposi ' s sarcoma ; and UNK of the limbs , a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis .    3.1766102101068525
cardial features of the UNK syndrome of UNK ( ocrl ) are congenital cataract , mental retardation , hypotonia and renal tubular dysfunction .    4.137101560489366
the primary biochemical defect remains unknown .    2.907865618759988
an inborn error of the UNK phosphate metabolism as a result of mutations within the ocrl gene localized on the x - chromosome is discussed .    3.7737229591479062
experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of UNK in man .    4.683292749862084
ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable .    3.0220651843316895
because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory , such as UNK recording of transmembrane action potentials and high - density optical and electrical activation mapping , animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies .    3.533162999541125
studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias .    3.7069555580348026
animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed .    3.193376968150465
the purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation .    2.5671040531830887
some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed .    3.3867378339072416
because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction .    3.5023043042785615
the authors report a rare , recently diagnosed and atypical UNK during one - lung ventilation ( olv ) via a double lumen tube ( dlt ) and left - sided thoracotomy : an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung .    2.961030851110467
this occurred in a 63 - year - old patient with chronic obstructive airway disease who was scheduled for urgent repair of a descending thoracic aortic aneurysm .    3.065685370496388
anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross - clamping release .    3.198291185446394
the common presentation of increased intrathoracic UNK pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation , followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration .    3.1469022330445395
although the above presentation could be seen in this case , the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice .    3.8042590995203067
first , symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head - down tilt and aortic declamping .    3.0322894802114853
second , since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems , complications resulting from the use of a dlt were primarily considered .    3.463753784772672
in particular , since breathing sounds were detectable initially , malposition or torsion of the dlt had to be excluded by fibre - optic bronchoscopy , which involved a further delay .    2.869478430536888
finally , two observations led to the diagnosis of a right - sided tension pneumothorax : ( 1 ) bullae of the contralateral lung , detected during thoracotomy ; ( 2 ) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial ( sao2 ) and mixed venous oxygen saturation ( UNK ) and the circulatory status , but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration .    3.4886116634172186
chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air , thereafter , validated our hypothesis .    3.0019590778338494
the time course of oxygen desaturation during olv and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected ; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration , however , appeared quicker and had more impact than expected .    3.3884671243180176
assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy , we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax .    3.1907537124442698
yet , during thoracotomy , decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in olv obviously results primarily from the UNK of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed - chest patients .    3.2372539957919426
in summary , a tension pneumothorax during one - lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare , but disastrous complication during the use of a dlt , which has not , to our knowledge , been reported previously .    3.2912691386384365
we recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during olv by the use of a dlt , especially in patients with structural lung diseases .    3.5783134574632554
the intramedullary hip screw system classic - nail and the dynamic hip screw ( dhs ) were evaluated in a prospective - randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures .    3.015739547095343
hundred and ten geriatric patients ( mean age 82 years ) were UNK included in the study ( 56 classic nail , 54 dhs ) .    3.9394274119070865
no significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow - up data .    3.725641823322834
with the classic - nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires .    2.8565375004934
in the dhs group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively .    2.986648997133004
at an UNK follow - up of 3 . 7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups .    3.732595475172845
- classic nail and dhs both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures .    2.8725806801389777
the internal fixation of fractures of shaft bones was spread out by a group of surgeons working together with UNK .    3.3516890141816873
the principle of this method is a three point load carrying ( entry point , height of fracture and cancellous bone of the metaphysis of the opposite fracture part ) .    3.035954860239423
from 1996 to 1999 86 children with fractures of the humerus , the fore - arm and the femur were operated in the technique of intramedullary nailing .    3.2305097368386178
the fractures affected the humerus to 3 . 5 % , the fore - arm to 65 . 1 % and the femoral shaft to 31 . 4 % .    3.7960505550740353
the UNK duration of stay in hospital after internal fixation of the fore - arm in the proximal and middle third lasted 7 . 2 days , the duration of immobilisation in a cast took 13 . 7 days .    3.4796929450622613
96 % of the patients showed very good and good results after operation .    4.2603696544620355
the average stay in hospital for patients with femoral shaft fractures was 14 . 4 days .    3.7401406666513495
17 weeks after operation the intramedullary nails were removed .    3.490907081697036
at the time of first full weight bearing the legs showed an average shortening of 1 . 2 cm .    3.498620538212145
the fractures of the humerus healed without any restriction of movements .    3.4714249876336285
internal fixation is a minimal invasive operation technique with low risks and small operating trauma .    3.434393720591071
due to the stability a early mobilisation is possible .    3.017588923655952
the reported results in the literature are all good .    4.560622815113638
the only problem can be caused by too long nails irritating the skin .    3.1041841571948097
objectives relief of pain in therapy - resistant lateral UNK through denervation and indirect decompression of the deep branch of the radial nerve through detachment of the UNK muscle only .    3.7429182321324435
physiology and age dependant changes of human bone marrow are described .    3.2287550818153368
the resulting normal distribution patterns of active and inactive bone marrow including the various UNK on different mr - sequences are discussed .    3.0390253647705157
this report is based upon experience with UNK implantations of UNK UNK spacer between 1978 and 1992 .    3.4167357602597543
the results of 430 cases were followed up in 1995 .    3.2637595046980516
complications were observed in 31 cases and required further surgery .    3.5477594682806592
in 18 cases , the spacer was resected ; in 2 cases a distal amputation was necessary .    3.36264189532968
due to pain , the spacer was changed in 11 cases , in 5 cases from a single - stem to a double - stem version .    4.106127142423527
radiological reactions increase over time following the operation without correlation to pain .    3.2247661272669315
the results in cases of rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis disease are compared .    3.496410246671665
approximately 80 % of the patients are free of pain and more than 90 % are satisfied with the functional results .    3.9645512243572902
the results of the arthrosis group are slightly better .    2.7033232332979344
methods : a total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a UNK blood - brain barrier were studied .    3.6058519850690254
t1 - weighted flash , turbo - flash and conventional spin - echo images were evaluated after controlled 30 - s infusion of 0 . 1 mmol / kg body weight of gd - dtpa .    3.04515391438074
the evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal - and contrast - to - noise ratios , the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts , and the measurement of tumor size .    3.6604534424350894
results : the signal - and contrast - to - noise ratios were significantly ( p < 0 . 05 - 0 . 01 ) lower for flash and turbo - flash than for conventional spin - echo sequences .    2.6997015061405434
however , visual inspection of the contrast - enhancing tumors revealed in 23 and 24 of 25 lesions on flash and UNK - UNK - flash images , respectively , good or very good tumor UNK when compared with conventional spin - echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7 - 8 .    3.688197261166224
flash and turbo - flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts , conventional spin - echo sequences more to UNK artifacts in the posterior fossa .    2.755599566297789
tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques .    3.6100074033442944
conclusion : at present , conventional spin - echo images are superior to fast flash and ultrafast turbo - flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high - precision radiotherapy .    2.6915510932731412
however , fast flash and turbo - flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin - echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device .    2.8703089937960575
despite some limitations , turbo - flash sequences enable fast dynamic mr imaging combined with an acceptable morphology , which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high - precision radiotherapy .    2.8710883975194124
cystic tumors of the neck are usually cysts , UNK masses , lymph nodes , benign and malignant tumors or metastases .    4.159552561867893
ectopic salivary tissue is a rather rare but clinically important malformation .    3.499700852816398
accessory and aberrant tissue can be identified histologically .    3.681542404618097
there may be an association with lymphatic tissue .    3.8811069096675133
possible complications include inflammation as well as the development of benign and in rare cases malignant salivary gland tumors .    3.793311492580033
we report on two patients who underwent surgical treatment under the tentative diagnosis of epidermal cysts which histologically turned out to be ectopic parotid tissue .    2.7992561917958083
nucleotides are low molecular weight biological compounds that play major roles in almost all - biological processes .    3.197307419527563
cell nucleic acids and nucleotides are continuously UNK , degraded and salvaged .    2.901371354367007
the body ' s pools derive from three potential sources : synthesis de novo , salvage ( UNK of preformed bases ) and the diet .    3.1359674192823648
it is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis .    2.42042776267773
when protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis ( after gut injury , after surgical trauma , sepsis , rapid growth : pregnancy or newborn infants , etc . )    3.194672495357894
some tissues with a rapid turnover ( gut and immune system ) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet .    2.9962370949941675
therefore , nucleotides may become UNK essential nutrients .    3.0221236304689465
this article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine ( maturation and recovery ) and gut microflora , lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system .    2.959256252596438
human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide / nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines .    3.3133816474745355
moreover , pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue rna , as compared to purine ones .    3.20902424767369
additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas .    3.638452467981865
this includes : 1 ) to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue rna is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2 ) to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides .    3.335240601520435
in germany more than dm UNK million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms .    2.751644328351992
the aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of pd by assessing direct medical costs .    2.412774492844915
forty patients suffering from idiopathic pd were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study .    3.3182723901736746
the total annual costs reported were dm 14 , 500 , consisting of dm UNK for drug therapy and dm 8000 for other medical services , including hospital inpatient care ( dm UNK ) , outpatient care ( dm 700 ) , medical UNK ( dm 1100 ) and physiotherapy ( dm 600 ) .    3.0560702431015456
the costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease ( UNK and UNK stage ; UNK ) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations / dyskinesias . we found that both drug - therapy expenses and total medical costs UNK from UNK to UNK .    4.1440671880241435
the rarely employed s . c . therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in UNK .    3.3428951453686895
the occurrence of fluctuations / dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two .    2.524010996468059
indirect burden due to increased days off of work , unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in parkinson ' s disease .    2.7705846282023088
this study UNK that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only UNK the situation of patients suffering from pd , but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system .    3.319505661082089
the cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue is essentially intended to maintain fertility and endocrinological function in female cancer patients and female patients at increased risk of early menopause .    3.1981684780243627
after having been frozen and subsequently UNK , the tissue can , ideally , be transplanted to its original site , where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation .    3.3234114314439562
heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or UNK in UNK mice .    3.8774417049036143
in addition to the use of whole tissue , the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation ( ivm ) are discussed .    3.184594829041179
as in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue , pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the UNK oocytes .    4.308315017033219
although considerable progress has already been made in both directions , these are still , at the present time , experimental processes that require further in - depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application .    3.133522625105388
in addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue , ivm of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction .    2.778317812921588
the successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation .    3.7774074213359516
ivm is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of UNK patients , for instance , increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by " UNK " ivf cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes .    3.6616947290788353
background : UNK peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the UNK ; it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia .    3.5115567218579455
the aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques .    2.3925192143549525
the german registry for hearing loss in children ( dzh ) processes nationwide data from audiological centers .    2.7946304180387327
coping with the UNK data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control .    4.00512407555694
to establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states .    3.5277514682630797
use of the dzh as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached .    3.4887695761989326
special issues concerning data collection , transfer , storage and deletion , coding strategies to ensure UNK , checking for UNK UNK , data separation , and automated data analysis and data protection are explained .    3.155264392149179
cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension .    2.964638061230444
this interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure .    3.2790974416443763
as a final result an unscientific era comes about , on which karl UNK UNK in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made national UNK possible .    2.9375368029275233
based on the good statistical results of german obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries , it is shown that our patients ' demands for " gentle " obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics .    3.454535949797306
if the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together , " safe and gentle " obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother .    2.9522427143929715
objectives : due to its unique pharmacokinetics , the new esterase - UNK opioid remifentanil results in rapid post - anaesthesia recovery .    2.782093846373515
the aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane .    2.9611411277065107
dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer .    4.325145218017965
methods : patients ( asa status i - ii ) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial .    2.758918975361136
without premedication in the morning , anaesthesia was induced UNK in both groups : remifentanil bolus ( 1 µg / kg ) , start of remifentanil - infusion ( 0 . 5 µg / kg / min ) , followed immediately by propofol ( ca .    3.5180392353783283
for maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil ( 0 . 25 µg / kg / min ) was combined with either a propofol infusion of 0 . 1 mg / kg / min or 0 . 5 mac isoflurane ( = 0 . 6 vol . % ) in o2 / air .    3.596236044970149
anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded .    3.470007957196042
results : a total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique ( tables 1 and 2 ) .    3.0928288984527765
in both groups emergence was very rapid .    3.083022340117477
recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil - isoflurane than for remifentanil - propofol ( table 3 ) : spontaneous ventilation 5 . 1 vs 8 . 1 min ( p < 0 . 05 ) , extubation 5 . 5 vs . 8 . 6 min ( p < 0 . 02 ) , post - anaesthesia recovery score > = 9 of 10 points 6 . 2 vs 11 . 3 min ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and arrival at UNK 16 . 2 vs 19 . 2 min ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    3.287962498336665
mild to moderate UNK was noted in 40 % of all patients ( 9 cases following isoflurane , 7 following propofol ) .    3.5878065401639048
conclusions : using the manufacturer ' s recommended dosages , emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0 . 5 mac isoflurane than with 0 . 1 mg / kg / min propofol .    3.043793661846032
these results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co - anaesthetics , especially the applied dosages , and to different interactions with remifentanil .    3.612501541193207
present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction , especially for propofol , is possible .    3.6271380267575357
for both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state ( on - off phenomenon ) , which might contribute to post - anaesthesia safety .    3.160034831863468
exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma , with uva possibly UNK an important role .    4.042443116288553
hereditary factors are also relevant .    3.5376771225271533
in the dysplastic nevus syndrome a genetic instability has been shown by different methods .    3.495961600525893
in UNK UNK the dna repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma .    3.619054950614155
frequent and non - random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells .    3.455969204864739
these might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes .    2.840672529571957
especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes .    3.535098619620463
this hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas .    3.300607047670799
changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma , but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known .    3.188777997126018
neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood ' s epilepsy .    3.6091902144646717
in a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing .    2.8990127887858064
as a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing ( more sequential than simultaneous ) has been found .    3.2006561779193783
according to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment .    3.3779030893332678
our data indicate a possible affection of underlying UNK functions .    2.6981189291048175
the aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy .    2.964507232228784
so far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in icd therapy do not exist .    3.018517765438473
the shock energy tested during long - term follow - up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold ( dft ) .    3.435001451745632
a total number of 176 consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of icd patients were evaluated .    3.0109870271197328
the intraoperative defibrillation threshold ( dft ) was evaluated in a step - down protocol ( 15 , 10 , 8 , 5 j ) and hat to be < = 15 j for inclusion into the study .    3.3572338035566043
the lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as dft + augmented defibrillation threshold .    3.620412102001066
the dft + value was tested immediately after successful implantation , at discharge , and after a follow - up period of one year .    3.2992914377246243
prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups .    3.750181108402642
the energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice dft + and in the control group at the maximum energy output ( 34 j ) .    3.8991997250612394
the efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in dft UNK and in spontaneous episodes during long - term follow - up of the study group were compared to those in the control group .    3.4670781149566072
the dft + in the study group was 9 . 6 + / - 3 . 2 ; in control group 10 . 1 + / - . 35 j .    3.673469357227366
the UNK of successful defibrillation at dft + level after one year was 84 % .    3.0265198250294163
the success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) was 99 . 5 % in the study group ( 217 of UNK episodes ) and 99 % in the control group ( 201 of 203 episodes ) .    3.357966467867255
during follow - up of 24 + / - 9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group , 83 / 86 ( 96 . 5 ) monomorphic ventricular tachycardias ( UNK ) and 38 / 40 ( 95 % ) vf - episodes were converted successfully by the 2x dft + shock .    3.41356594166571
in the control group the first shock was successful in 151 / 156 ( 96 . 8 % ) spontaneous UNK and in 30 / 33 ( 91 % ) vf episodes .    3.592418356153781
the efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease , left ventricular function , ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone , or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the dft itself .    3.6702248514617906
at a mean follow - up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death ( 2 . 4 % in the study group vs . 3 . 8 % in the control group ) .    4.212241057682984
in conclusion programming the first shock with the icd lead system used in this study at 2x dft + is as efficient as a shock energy of 34 j in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of vt / vf .    3.468159810911919
thus , the safety of icd - therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x dft + value .    3.0661732178339878
UNK deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete UNK of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage .    3.7802568233316993
in cases of controversy it ' s the physician ' s due to prove the correct preoperative information .    3.2422327617050133
to reduce these liability - risks a computer based information system has been developed .    2.9753694304707126
with its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient .    2.9596440082045996
based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place .    2.9691443877807417
after the patient signed the record the physician keeps it at his disposal for proving the contents of the preoperative information .    2.7482854515624684
the conception ' s use over many years shows that UNK essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached .    3.482472159481363
in vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents UNK wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound UNK .    3.313889653758955
two test models are differentiated : ( 1 ) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and ( 2 ) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants .    3.1995250522503365
considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds : UNK ( 0 . 1 % ) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds , for UNK - UNK irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage ( 0 , 05 % ) .    3.5470693100360324
UNK is UNK effective in long term application ( > 6 h ) , and because of its UNK effect as well as lack of UNK it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage .    4.207738690534636
UNK solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short - term rinsing of deep wounds , including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage .    3.505784523551259
ethanol causes no inhibition of UNK growth and therefore UNK its importance in wound antisepsis .    3.3944178331701282
pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well - being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain .    3.613727328280803
thus , pain makes high demands on the health system .    2.8605572649066384
for the first time in the federal republic of germany the national health interview and examination survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain , its intensity , frequency , duration and localisation .    2.7780186549655888
furthermore , the results enable to differentiate according to age , gender , and social classes .    2.989488761215862
the sf - 36 , used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life , has been employed to demonstrate the UNK significance of pain for the well - being of the population .    3.6851526490600515
in this publication the connection between certain disease syndromes like migraine and arthrosis and the prevalence of different qualities of pain is investigated .    3.0234592143714045
additional more complex evaluation of the epidemiological data on pain are in preparation .    3.789161118923673
in order to get an effective therapy of UNK UNK drug must penetrate into the follicles .    3.354545758104101
this can not be obtained exclusively by local treatment so that a combination with systemic therapy is necessary .    3.400367986448576
UNK is the drug of choice in childhood until now .    3.2770533643092663
death may occur while a UNK or UNK suspect is taken into UNK by the police .    4.008806136703835
we report about this type of acute death in two males .    3.251530603582037
in both cases , a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures ( e . g .    2.9993326646931475
neck compression or " UNK " , chest compression ) .    3.9625706199561157
from the institute ' s autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with UNK by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison .    3.0984702941460456
of the 12 cases 5 were UNK injuries and 4 were classified as suicide .    3.4323492193097174
the analysis suggested an increased UNK to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine .    3.362194096688787
in both cases , cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were UNK of any acute life - threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the UNK to flee or UNK arrest .    3.6735101855375394
it was of interest whether there is a risk of hcv transmission from the UNK .    3.9437419419713313
the presence of hcv - rna indicates UNK in the living but this may be different post - mortem .    3.7850772277241993
to our knowledge no case of UNK infection from a corpse has been reported so far .    3.394828307932211
non - traumatic UNK fistulae are rare , but may be the source of massive UNK bleeding with associated fever and sepsis .    3.605328655840752
these fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen .    2.990653971242793
the outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs .    3.311699917282019
the therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava .    2.7068629879345956
we describe the seventh case with radiogenic duodenal ulcer .    2.7363251396363175
gastrointestinal bleeding occurred 10 years after radical nephrectomy and radiation ( 60 gy ) .    3.176436627650029
the patient survived following partial UNK ( whipple ) .    2.7514073884081642
purpose : branch retinal vein occlusion ( brvo ) induces variable functional deficits depending on the grade of vascular occlusion and its localisation .    3.1150556177713717
however , UNK offers topical mapping of retinal function , allowing precise documentation of the intensity and dimension of retinal functional loss in brvo .    2.9990982739335386
acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) is rare but UNK with a high mortality rate .    3.1006731176361555
in recent years , however , a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed .    3.053647190170819
this had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy .    3.068004094692298
mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ards have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung , prevent oxygen toxicity , UNK the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space .    2.8880589546845545
this new approach consists of various forms of pressure - controlled mechanical ventilation with peep and permissive hypercapnia , body position changes , and inhalation of nitric oxide .    3.086337654185739
should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option .    2.78889595523332
none of these therapeutic procedures , however , has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial .    3.6750975346062416
the following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology , diagnosis , and treatment of ards .    3.473183878324848
femoral neck fractures are frequent fractures of the elderly .    4.893570162916317
they can be treated by the use of dynamic hip screws , lag screws , bipolar UNK or total hip replacement .    3.4210725767979944
the results are markedly influenced by the timing of the operation and the choice of the implant .    3.3901081909039656
using the garden classification of femoral neck fracture we demonstrate a different therapeutic approach according to garden stadium i - iv .    2.9291807077809193
stool frequency after ileal pouch - anal anastomosis ( ipaa ) is about 5 / day after adaptation during the first year .    2.9678030021040582
it depends on stool volume and pouch capacity , not on the design of the pouch .    3.397713555893126
in most cases evacuation is spontaneous and as complete as in healthy rectum .    2.859446432312428
67 % of patients are perfectly continent , while 19 % have to wear UNK due to intermittent leakage .    3.952127376299706
complete incontinence is reported in 0 - 4 % of the patients .    3.442367235122312
preservation of the anal transitional zone by the double - stapling technique does not improve functional results when compared to UNK UNK or intersphincteric resection .    3.6322161820688503
impairment of continence is caused by damage of the internal sphincter with consecutive decrease of the pouch - anal pressure gradient .    4.256477725137362
the loss of colonic water and electrolyte absorption is compensated by decreased renal excretion .    3.1945014317538094
alterations in bile acid metabolism are lower after ipaa than after ileostomy .    3.185442540968735
bacterial overgrowth may lead to deterioration of the functional results .    3.890350979347819
background : methods from the area of virtual reality are used in oral and maxillofacial surgery for the planning and three - dimensional individual simulation of surgeries .    3.4620781643425995
thirty - seven patients with chronic sinus UNK were treated after total excision by UNK flap .    3.61012074536999
we saw seroma complications in three and wound infections in two cases .    3.1761532792791796
patients stayed in hospital 6 . 3 days on an average and were able to work after 2 . 5 weeks .    4.370732034462651
the method is easy to use .    2.6517369899181698
we have not seen a return to sinus problems in any of this cases .    3.237321255876917
we describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of 6 months .    2.8413261373713583
diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency .    3.4394577242196527
glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of UNK bodies .    3.105318666727835
it is characterized by supranormal increase of glucose and lactate in blood after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test .    2.8070020144211343
diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue , and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the UNK gene ( UNK - gene ) .    3.5523901650823038
hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein - rich UNK during the day and a late evening meal with UNK UNK starch .    3.5742941597570894
although most subacromial UNK are performed arthroscopically , rotator cuff repair is still performed using an open or mini - open procedure .    2.9101855732758795
arthroscopic techniques have improved in the last decade , however , so that rotator cuff repair can also be performed arthroscopically .    4.3050695493337505
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) has become a well - established method for the diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the great vessels .    3.6704893425875382
almost 20 % of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography .    3.49729434224526
in this patient group , mri can be used as a second line technique to provide important diagnostic information not UNK by echocardiography .    3.4137491111118043
mri is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique , especially in patients with coronary artery disease .    3.1397291289449023
in the last 7 years we have performed 220 infrainguinal vein bypasses associated with critical limb ischemia .    2.883593171528517
all patients were prospectively controlled in a follow - up program 3 - 72 months postoperatively .    3.3743725938297167
there was no difference in sex , age or localization of distal anastomosis ( supra - or UNK ) between the two groups .    2.692728168189915
the primary and the primary - assisted patency rates were not statistically different after 60 months .    2.9868609738681204
there was a significant difference in limb salvage .    2.925189538678788
the limb salvage of group 1 was 75 % after 60 months , while the limb salvage of group 2 was 95 % ( p = 0 . 0045 ) .    3.1364273011086827
the rate of major amputations was significantly higher in group 1 ( 15 . 6 % ) than in group 2 ( 4 . 9 % , p = 0 . UNK ) .    3.8215179647750364
the indication for amputation was persistent foot infection .    2.8252568045122723
a 24 - year - old woman with lymph vessel dysplasia had experienced a progressive edema of her legs since her second year of life and progressive facial edema for the past year .    3.068286178962989
she also had UNK and papules on the background of a diffuse erythema as well as marked seborrhea on her face .    3.6784302672982303
histopathological examination of a representative facial lesion revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with UNK distribution mainly consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes .    2.8700069264334718
in addition , there was a moderate fibrosis of the dermis with numerous mast cells .    2.8151384777157986
by duplex ultrasound , a diagnosis of a massive edema of the legs without evidence for chronic venous insufficiency was made .    3.904018284966683
the clinical and histopathological findings were consistent with solid persistent erythema and edema of the face associated with rosacea and lymph vessel dysplasia .    3.0127014107965353
the chronic course , absence of serological abnormalities and nonspecific histopathological features as well as resistance to therapy are the most important diagnostic UNK of this disease also known as morbihan ' s disease .    3.937857895592741
the cervical spine is an extremely complex functional unit and has always been the subject of UNK discussions among surgeons , orthopedic specialists and neurologists .    3.0975467842034132
in fact , in view of the clinical and technical neurophysiological options available to neurologists , it would be desirable for them to be involved as early as possible .    3.208574582208838
in this paper the relative value of neurology , compared with orthopedics and surgery , in the diagnosis and treatment of whiplash injury to the cervical spine is discussed .    3.4878614516233277
the newer options available - particularly in neurophysiology - are highlighted , as are the differential diagnosis and problems concerned with official expert assessments , which also involve other specialties .    2.9960251413640777
a 19 - year - old male patient with chronic cutaneous UNK was treated UNK with paromomycin sulphate ( 15 % ) and UNK chloride ( 12 % ) in UNK UNK .    3.731783053637718
after application twice daily for two periods of 32 and 44 days the lesions were completely healed .    3.048516803968107
previous treatment for 9 months with ketoconazole ( 400 mg / day ) together with the topical application of UNK ( 2 . 5 % ) in base had been unsuccessful .    4.072237331184848
no major side effects were observed after paromomycin sulphate application .    3.2590494429696175
eight patients with spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhages are presented .    2.9803694676400236
in seven cases , progressive neurological deficits had developed , some of which led to complete paraplegia .    3.1886723559312418
on all eight patients operations were performed .    3.4136814856874835
after an average of 11 weeks ' follow - up , full recovery from the preoperative pain and neurological deficits could be seen in 6 of the patients .    3.3880571859017756
the confusion of scientific , economic , UNK and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture .    3.8695350517543265
the author UNK for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession UNK against powerful UNK by other contexts .    2.8877715098388195
the debate about UNK ( " empirically supported therapy " ) is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted .    3.271219127339959
scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields , as well - known researchers meanwhile fear .    3.7715347748937287
in economic contexts the aim is efficiency , in professional contexts it is quality .    3.2288042298103177
to develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization .    3.163824176025719
this could help to rise professionals ' self - confidence .    2.7761650362663235
procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity .    2.779054756673516
normally , procalcitonin is produced in the c - cells of the thyroid gland .    2.0405771150209007
in healthy humans procalcitonin levels are UNK ( < 0 . 1 ng / ml ) .    3.6234380878612007
during severe generalized infections ( bacterial , parasitic and fungal ) with systemic manifestations , procalcitonin levels may rise up to 100 ng / ml .    3.103199515264274
in contrast , severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non - infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels .    3.129348373696044
the exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity .    2.97910707055517
in this retrospective study , oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages c and d are reported .    3.0526162770086
the surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid - transcervical approach , which was modified according to individual tumor growth .    3.3267287528588017
as needed , this was combined with a UNK or UNK approach .    4.57412085406466
complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100 % .    3.074248691575547
surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38 % of the patients .    3.207493379792309
in 54 % of cases it was possible to UNK middle ear function .    4.144620419187817
seven patients had incomplete tumor removal requiring postoperative irradiation , with tumor progression occurring in 2 patients .    3.09524316526688
radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections .    3.316981202067337
these results show that individually tailored and combined UNK surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity .    3.211609275015741
electron beam ct , which does not require mechanical movement of an x - ray tube , has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten .    3.2819653085325267
axial images of the heart can be acquired within 50 to 100 ms with a spatial resolution below 0 . 5 mm2 and permit precise visualization of all cardiac structures .    3.2602770211267917
ecg - triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images ( 3 mm slice thickness ) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3 - dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart .    3.2474132561251197
overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds .    3.2222126474499615
while electron beam ct in general permits a complete cardiac investigation , including morphology , function , and perfusion , the method ' s most important application is non - invasive imaging of the coronary arteries .    3.062722155871778
UNK injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses .    3.2373512246980414
this method is especially well suited in the follow - up of coronary interventions and coronary bypass grafting .    3.3146369955915174
breathhold and movement artifacts , superposition of coronary arteries and veins , as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method ' s main problems .    3.2987929247579006
in spite of these limitations , electron beam ct has been shown to permit clinically valuable non - invasive investigations of the coronary arteries , which may be further refined as technology progresses .    3.504495873304787
despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography , computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30 % of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death .    3.494133889435565
a novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection .    3.400486080403824
the immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease .    3.7407820450650684
in both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory , electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination .    2.9560548974105862
in the first patient both dilation of the UNK and long - standing arterial hypertension were known ; however , it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral - ct was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection .    3.5753813987152405
at this time ( 48 h after onset of symptoms ) the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal .    3.0278630050496873
in the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection .    2.8169322260519425
widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type b dissection .    4.000528295604782
the serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated ( diagnostic ) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains .    2.896901117766835
recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10 - 25 % of school - aged children , thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood .    3.616097495503912
despite that , our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete .    3.688502541689226
following oral surgery , there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing .    3.4552916584108058
it was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing .    2.69318659368607
resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients ( 19 to 53 years of age ) prior to oral surgery .    3.6692357926108263
flow rate , ph , standard bicarbonate , total buffer bases , peroxidase , lysozyme , thiocyanate , secretory immunoglobulin a , lactoferrin , total protein , tissue type plasminogen activator , and plasminogen activator inhibitor were determined .    2.669024440306108
the salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing .    4.006742280176781
patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva .    2.8284874360601724
not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy , but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator , peroxidase , plus secretory immunoglobulin a measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible .    3.3426803099784714
a discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups .    3.268009685120271
nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive UNK of myocardial function , perfusion , and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology .    3.295310612242096
advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations .    3.451839706983527
the improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making .    3.202819555954334
information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required .    3.0917595117478145
nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease .    4.421487581888969
the prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy , thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost - effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease .    3.4566462721329434
extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques .    3.185843745695235
furthermore , ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new UNK will pave the way for disease - specific , molecular - targeted cardiac imaging in the future .    3.363162578590506
epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia .    3.196200071095791
the anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics .    3.506281397138431
however , despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively , intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone , necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [ 21 ] .    2.966090096580712
addition of epidural fentanyl has been shown to improve onset and quality of perioperative analgesia without evident side effects for mother or newborn [ 24 ] .    3.300610909860092
nevertheless , administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still UNK debated , some UNK maternal and or neonatal depression [ 6 , 26 ] .    2.8897975521403234
the aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia , associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0 . 1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone .    3.1024281397800038
the quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection .    2.9684390536767116
even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible , the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a UNK - UNK fashion subsequent to formalin - fixation and serial cross - sectioning of the coronary arteries , with decalcification in addition if necessary .    3.2598655994964907
the distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis , the longitudinal , circumferential and transmural extent of infarction , its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by UNK the heart chambers according to the flow of blood .    3.5475967840534834
cross - sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing , plaque hemorrhage , parietal and UNK thrombi and the effects and complications of UNK procedures or bypass surgery .    3.404100020920586
transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short - term territorial ischemia .    3.7915570893139408
total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery .    3.219429974654379
in germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation .    2.93492517658524
we reviewed the different principles , with particular reference to long - term clinical outcome , and discuss the most popular systems available in germany .    3.519292804268812
despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement , cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the " gold standard " until prospective long - term data ( > 15 years ) of cementless systems become available .    3.4729480573271236
to summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( crohn ' s disease , ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis ) .    3.2988141078150965
procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin .    3.0710958173199323
it is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial , parasitic or fungal infection .    3.2588335506799693
in contrast , procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non - infectious systemic inflammatory states .    2.970354358925997
because of these properties , procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis .    3.172305593062055
increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity .    3.936879421761228
normally , procalcitonin is produced in the c - cells of the thyroid gland .    2.0405771150209007
although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections , a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis .    3.2022387852877015
more studies are needed to UNK the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule .    4.057415903582177
fractures of the hand UNK are common injuries .    4.020007260457726
these are or are associated with phalangeal fractures .    3.343176079976523
we found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing kirschner wire diameter .    3.548308901495477
because of these findings kirschner wires of 1 . 0 or 1 . 25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures .    3.235388503066761
UNK , a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of - l - fucosidase , was diagnosed in two unrelated male german patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation , dysostosis multiplex , UNK of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3 . 2 and 4 years , respectively .    3.3698923597468875
in both cases , activity of - l - fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible .    2.5740119960975907
dna analysis revealed a UNK mutation ( g401x ) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene ; this leads to a premature stop UNK and c - terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein .    3.109958805235445
discussion : on account of the mutation a unique UNK restriction site is obliterated ; this UNK molecular diagnosis of the g401x mutation .    3.0988406788603475
so far , the mutation g401x has not been found in any other population .    3.087752851496208
the main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia .    2.768479402034448
both , severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not .    3.086847813606229
to minimize misleading false negative sjo2 , the ct - approach for the side of UNK and calculation of arterial - jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended .    3.491477471934737
targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory .    3.6775109876912504
primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional cbf .    3.303842296973956
within the autoregulatory range decreasing cpp causes vasodilation and increasing cpp vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively .    2.7842598569005
initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires cpp 70 mmhg .    3.601968315061803
targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing cpp .    2.7303276083000125
in the early UNK phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia UNK on management of cbf by means of cpp and cerebral vascular resistance .    3.294795086467017
thereafter targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension caused by cerebral edema and UNK are increasingly important .    3.363657332081586
today , orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end - stage of various liver diseases , and a 1 - year survival rate of 80 % and a 5 - year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys .    3.799907615320852
the liver transplant programme of the inselspital in bern is small compared with international centres , which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme .    3.2110320182938037
over a period of 66 months , 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the inselspital .    3.1735916760332796
the hospital mortality was 3 . 3 % , and the 2 . 5 - year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor .    3.756794040531287
after a median follow - up of 30 months , 68 % of all patients were re - integrated in UNK or full - or part - time in their profession , and 83 % were independent from the help of others .    3.499706929418301
we conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards .    2.8586262809258853
accidental hypothermia ( ah ) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35 °c during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic UNK dysfunction .    2.7351530587647144
pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co - morbid factors such as trauma , UNK , intoxication and underlying diseases .    3.887138318363347
in trauma victims stratified according to the injury severity score , the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival .    3.696962054452044
in these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible .    3.2452376125325184
in the UNK university hospital , adult patients with ah are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions .    3.235440026102708
patients with UNK cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmhg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming ( cavr ) .    2.7771204141046986
arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) .    2.834196798324064
in a 3 - year period , 22 patients with ah were admitted to the emergency department .    3.3404600769836477
fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia .    4.524055129779842
twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm ( cavr n = 18 , cpb n = 2 ) and two patients were alternatively managed .    3.6910870765976354
mortality in the cavr group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 % .    3.1979041720322092
complications of cavr are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation .    3.5565686019072644
cavr permits a good access to the ( trauma - ) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries .    3.512080881284457
the grading of long - tubular - bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non - unions .    3.7323351284834776
hypertrophic and UNK pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non - unions , whereas non - reacting non - unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non - unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance .    2.773127022023747
pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing , which consists of UNK , UNK and stabilization .    3.6545689239720445
the causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost , cortical substance and medullary space .    3.008047350890064
this can occur from trauma , but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone - healing into account .    3.430570198077375
surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue , cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture - healing and fracture union .    3.2532521159071437
background : clonidine , an 2 - receptor agonist , has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics .    3.4490125925058686
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of UNK injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics .    2.8074380533283514
differentiation of an elevated , repeatedly determined platelet count ( > = UNK / l ) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic UNK - UNK disorder ( cmpd ) .    3.523283490734548
in addition to clinical findings , the evolution of laboratory data during follow - up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact .    3.371194291517649
characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis , but also by the myeloid stromal compartment .    3.737716274413202
while the megakaryocyte - rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) and the UNK - syndrome ( mds ) are dominated by abnormal UNK , in polycythemia vera ( pv ) this cell lineage reveals a UNK appearance .    3.1570810775666707
in essential thrombocythemia ( et ) , a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated ( UNK - like ) nuclei may be encountered .    3.7130156071221916
a clear - cut discrimination of et from early ( UNK ) stages of idiopathic ( primary ) myelofibrosis ( imf ) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible , provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis UNK the latter entity are taken into account .    2.9044709596638367
moreover , cml displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas pv shows a UNK or UNK proliferation , involving erythropoiesis , in particular .    3.209121807182548
in contrast , erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in cml and to a lesser degree also in imf .    2.8960275051420985
in cmpds extreme values of iron deposits may be found , ranging from a total lack ( pv ) to minor amounts ( cml ) and a normal staining reaction ( et ) .    3.3870106370381134
similar results are exhibited regarding UNK fibrosis , which is usually not present in et , rarely observed in pv and detectable to a variable degree in cml and imf .    3.208831981388634
nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon .    3.625611355578834
this benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia .    3.0784122800770417
we report the case of a 56 - year - old patient who underwent breast biopsy , followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy .    2.83921726532733
histological examination revealed solid cell aggregates as foreign tissue in the capsule of 1 of 11 identified lymph nodes devoid of any keratin UNK .    2.797205209823338
strong immunohistological staining for the s - 100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates .    3.629176319236235
we report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation .    2.677995372485938
UNK - like abdominal pain and a UNK were the first symptoms .    4.50139001290425
UNK did not relieve the symptoms , and the following UNK with UNK catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities .    3.9615146097218106
two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed .    3.5069735994584526
further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella - zoster virus was isolated from their fluid .    2.7467383964355654
despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella - zoster immune UNK further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy .    2.7080839013658187
the patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure .    2.7932702833905982
the unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit .    2.7527986265952396
patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously .    3.31472771306186
after checking vital signs , deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation , an intravenous line must be established , blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given .    2.991325412633963
the physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points : best reaction to loud UNK , best motor reaction to noxious stimuli , respiratory pattern , size and reactions of pupils , eye movements , corneal and UNK reflex , UNK , muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes .    3.220598419989657
with this approach it is possible to UNK a working diagnosis , and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed .    3.9511895327796878
a severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28 % of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system ( cns ) diseases .    3.84422329820633
in any atypical alcoholic delirium , especially with focal neurological signs , partial seizures , or decreased level of consciousness , cns diseases like meningoencephalitis , intracranial hemorrhage , or central pontine UNK must be diagnosed by computed tomography ( ct ) scan and cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) tap .    3.0498733779350533
the diagnostic and prognostic value of ct scan and csf analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens .    3.184638269858835
blood - csf barrier permeability is increased in 70 % of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course .    3.5243762054338386
cerebral atrophy as shown in ct scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course .    3.099416101966758
in our experience , ct examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium .    2.9283104329881713
recently , an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed .    2.6980764844328324
one component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall .    3.3756685471219785
the membrane of the microphone can be covered by skin , cartilage , or fascia , avoiding reduction in sound transmission at the same time .    2.930829779147202
in the study presented here , the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone .    3.1351332736852457
localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve .    3.986068581033891
the microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78 % of the temporal bones after total UNK .    3.5901365144050206
in the final version of the microphone , the size was 4 . 5 mm and total weight 400 mg .    3.4450636406677493
collagen vascular diseases , representing systemic soft tissue disorders , may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract .    3.5517369400188445
the type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities .    3.169943379147308
this survey describes the chest radiographic and , in particular , high - resolution computed tomographic ( hrct ) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract .    3.531354894584322
it includes UNK alveolitis ( alveolitis , interstitial pneumonia , pulmonary fibrosis ) and bronchial ( UNK / bronchiolitis , UNK ) , pleural and vascular manifestations , as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy .    3.574354281539866
we present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis ( pss , scleroderma ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , mixed connective tissue disease ( UNK , sharp syndrome ) , sjögren syndrome , overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) .    2.8348988905957646
furthermore , we describe findings which are specific for individual entities such as esophageal involvement in pss , acute UNK and pulmonary hemorrhage in sle , lymphoproliferative disease in sjögren syndrome and necrobiotic nodules in ra .    2.7906336755291625
the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders , eating disorders , or " hysterical " symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence .    3.097438239893737
dissociation with induced depersonalisation , derealisation , and UNK of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience .    3.6615028588229546
UNK UNK of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders , substance abuse , self - UNK behaviour , or social acting - out .    3.096540008142198
against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma - therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of guided affective imagery .    3.063703042458533
in the UNK phase a secure inner space and contact to inner UNK are established in the imagination using a resource - oriented approach .    3.1514416074255203
the actual trauma - therapy consists of a gradual leading - up to the traumatic scenes through consistent , minimally retraumatizing confrontation , followed by UNK and the ability to UNK go .    3.7975817460984365
in the final phase there is a return to resource - oriented UNK and concrete life planning .    3.1483905085733563
all patients of the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the UNK hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years , from 1987 to 1997 .    3.4782835698339545
this included questions concerning frequency , seriousness and treatment of these infections , social changes in the UNK prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course .    4.04994905431725
odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections .    3.375241880667097
aerobic agents such as hemolytic UNK and UNK as well as anaerobic bacteria and fungi can be involved .    3.8553402748681314
cephalosporine , UNK in combination with - UNK inhibitor , UNK and UNK are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with UNK as a reserve antibiotic .    4.12848374504752
hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector .    3.0472817375672006
comparison of hospitals is legally required ( bpflv § 5 ) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals UNK , while also UNK it .    3.007596731668536
if comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance UNK or efficiency , and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality , it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation UNK performance and calculation and the hospital statistics ( no .    3.270107571440016
of cases , days of care , length of stay , case lump sums and special fees ) .    3.5742372859624223
documentation of particular features of the patient population , the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level .    4.250434354390913
with rising costs , the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service .    3.4776638067302272
hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital ' s own situation with regard to performance , quality , efficiency and patient satisfaction , but can also provide a basis for structural planning .    3.496965456043408
the fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures , processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients , the doctors who refer them and the UNK .    3.778388753199504
if hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the UNK data , it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level .    3.6892419770313865
this would be bad for the patient and , in view of the consequent costs , also for the overall costs in the health care sector .    3.6136521546815885
against the backdrop of a future performance - related system of UNK instead of the principle of covering one ' s own costs that has been in place hitherto , openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals .    2.990969288270196
laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy .    3.3307588185658195
on average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient , and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1 - 9 lymph nodes .    3.6064301068899742
after an initial learning curve , mean operative time was reduced significantly , allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one - stage procedure .    3.178836361444404
postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only .    3.575720468452051
this minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy , as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy .    3.7274552150692033
the combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus UNK both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence .    2.9657088631278095
taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example , three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to UNK are presented and discussed : the localizing , the metaphorical and the modelling relation .    3.1989972961769606
the need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early ; at the same time it is argued that - after the UNK of the old UNK - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK .    3.5653052857611907
following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus , special post - operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results .    3.8539331517769035
proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon , physical therapists and nurses .    3.2212320351437227
only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve .    3.4910837108686503
we describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer , arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint , biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer , UNK UNK and augmentation of UNK / extensors muscles in the hand .    3.1651911808224944
the prevalence of type i allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire , prick tests and the determination of specific ige antibodies .    3.103022696842462
positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 ( 8 . 7 % ) of 206 students , with clinical relevance in 11 cases .    3.965293377342848
when the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2 % in the second semester to 10 . 4 % in the tenth semester was seen .    3.9595194217480576
a history of UNK intolerance presenting as a UNK - and - flare reaction was associated with a type i allergy against latex in only 50 % of the affected subjects .    4.515308291891767
atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy , respectively .    3.383567219004847
a high - ammonia accelerator - free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific ige antibodies to latex .    3.2891652513824936
gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients .    3.361167855708763
in addition to tumor relapse , the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading , and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages ( radiogenic stenosis , adhesions ) may also be the cause for the obstruction .    3.310963995724238
the main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery .    3.4538411416483488
if this is not possible because of advanced intra - abdominal tumor expansion , several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods , and drugs are available , that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient ' s condition .    3.176984786133834
the case of a 60 - year - old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma ( UNK ) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented .    3.5056655260599987
on one side , the sacculus opened atypically into the left vestibular fold .    2.8346017916494066
the sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of UNK ' s ventricle , the size of which can vary greatly .    4.282692281538655
these canal - like structures can be the point of origin of cysts , UNK , UNK , and UNK .    3.4272286605203695
adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed - chest cardiac UNK are common , and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used .    3.639731518181505
nevertheless , thrombolytic therapy of a myocardial infarction can become necessary even after cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) .    2.8863861889063958
in these patients , the risk of thrombolytic therapy - induced bleeding is immanent .    4.224980717317765
implantable cardioverter / defibrillators ( icd ) have led to a reduction in cardiac mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias .    3.9742409357806174
a considerable number of patients experience repeated shocks which may have an impact on the quality of life .    2.966526140166259
an overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the orthopedic university hospital heidelberg is presented .    2.8779797723690383
since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described : first UNK of medical doctors , establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes , strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services .    3.120196574911456
planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the UNK and concepts of the university clinics of the state of UNK - UNK .    4.574614533319576
the treatment success of ncpap therapy ( nasal continuous positive airway pressure ) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long - term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications . nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and , together with problems of mask application , are among the primary factors causing an ncpap - therapy to be prematurely discontinued .    3.4119004209828643
the foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals , but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum .    3.331314213774235
right - to - left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises , for example , as a result of pulmonary embolism .    3.511792379798398
in the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented 20 days after UNK treatment of a femoral fracture with word - finding deficits .    3.397991213779307
cerebral mrt revealed a fresh ischemic insult .    3.2681351357197834
transesophageal contrast echocardiography trapped a hemodynamically spontaneous , open foramen ovale .    2.810384056506171
duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries detected no pathological findings .    3.329527194408425
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be clinically UNK and become manifest by cerebral deficits resulting from UNK embolism and cerebral ischemia .    3.020172141684151
the diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life - threatening injuries , recognition of serious organ lesions , and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact , as well as the resulting host reaction .    3.322555313873724
besides improvements in the structure and organization , major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room .    3.9724602247580685
systematic diagnostic work - up , integrated multidisciplinary approach , and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management .    3.1459470911088308
pheochromocytomas are functionally active , catecholamine - secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue .    3.086956583327929
the mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine .    3.0006435288531423
this drug irreversibly UNK alpha - 1 - adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them UNK , thereby causing vasodilatation .    2.893193897376504
UNK , a short - acting , competitive alpha - 1 blocker , has been used preoperatively , but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes .    3.2912532542208632
case report : case presentation of a 59 - year old female patient , who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with UNK acid .    3.1244317074530277
for this therapy to be successful - according to the physician - all drugs especially the analgetics had to be stopped .    4.116637497545657
we present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus .    2.9623869887437886
occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia .    3.470046132242245
therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy .    3.487007546529614
this type of lung - conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before .    3.3706117294275773
UNK male patients with a tentative diagnosis " UNK " were examined between november 1984 and december 1994 in the department of dermatology and UNK of the military hospital in ulm .    4.078762737023945
the patients , aged from 18 to 58 years ( mean age 24 . 1 years ) , were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure : .    3.806638178847597
the use of the UNK - assessment battery for children ( k - abc ) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range , as there exist no special tests for this group of patients .    3.4082266287658265
UNK - and factor analyses , and correlations with the german adaptation of the UNK adult intelligence scale ( UNK - r ) proved the use of the k - abc to be valid .    4.426603093919378
as an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2 - 6 to 12 - 5 years is more adequate to the capability of UNK impaired adults , the k - abc delivers results on individual UNK and weaknesses , based on a neuropsychological theory .    3.1843100459233273
thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation , and that gives an important base for intervention , partial UNK , and placement .    3.6736155947517597
subject : using multi - slice computed tomography ( msct ) large body areas can scanned with high spatial resolution .    2.6730444939445808
in this study , msct was employed for virtual colonoscopy in various pathologies of the colon .    2.732961389313622
in a regional quality assurance project for screening mammography ( german mammography study ) , 27 UNK women were screened in 40 participating , office - based mammography units from 1990 - 1992 .    2.8527767845245644
screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0 . 33 .    3.541546111270197
all biopsy documentation available to the mammography physicians was analysed with a view towards biopsy interval and completeness of information fed back to the mx physicians .    3.0424091312945403
biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29 % of cases within 2 weeks .    3.4919769497792466
with the exception of the dignity mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results .    2.4010622413728515
the surgical procedure was known in the doctors ' offices in 62 % of the cases .    2.9051989288556306
specimen UNK were not done regularly .    3.996238563325923
a pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases , respectively .    2.878402149905953
with the exception of the histological diagnosis itself , no variable mentioned in the reports was documented completely .    2.9292231888264997
only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely .    3.544445954316571
fail - safe information are requested by mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations .    3.112613574246324
a ( regional ) quality assurance center should be made responsible to analyse the flow of information in mammography screening , to fill in gaps and to speed up professional cooperation .    3.067544350004683
the high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment .    3.498950696456713
in a 13 - year period , 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively .    3.2379463054450346
the was being left in situ on an average of 6 . 6 days .    3.669919702745305
after an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients ( 3 . 9 % ; causes : volvulus after 6 months / fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day ) .    3.5009651857748456
amongst the 43 ' non - splinted ' patients , recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases ( 18 . 6 % ; causes : adhesions after 0 . 3 - 136 . 9 months ) .    3.3496912941168464
in the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted .    3.3327352302116355
complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur .    2.803405011737679
the rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups .    2.787472268745406
minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision .    3.513447294704912
in this study , we report the results of minimally avr compared to the conventional method performed in the same period .    4.148372476658806
from may 1996 to january 1998 , 86 patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy ( group 1 ) .    3.013815383903264
as a control group ( group 2 ) , 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period .    3.3608819069603153
av - synchrony and rate - responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence .    3.8624223094691046
however , their importance throughout low - levels of exercise is poorly evaluated .    2.9492750076245935
we studied 11 patients with implanted dual - chamber pacemakers ( UNK , meta UNK ) concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of 35 w ( UNK protocol ) .    3.142763178045797
each patient was tested in vvir - , ddd - , and dddr - mode .    3.3845101432893685
all av delays were constant at UNK .    3.2083139516410437
the oxygen deficit ( o2d ) , mean response time ( mrt ) for oxygen uptake , and a oxygen deficit index ( o2di ) were determined .    3.5177394741547374
results : significant differences ( p < 0 . 01 ) were observed in hr and o2d when comparing both ddd - to vvir - and ddd - to dddr - modes .    2.965696718403255
comparing the randomly synchronous vvir - to the dddr - mode , only the mrt of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the dddr - mode ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.6484895340430694
there were also significant decreases in o2di and mrt in the dddr - mode , as compared to the non - rate responsive ddd - mode ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.8515045206181964
stress testing in pm patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise UNK that av synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate - adaptive pacing .    3.061896103876219
purpose : this paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work - up of crohn ' s disease ( cd ) .    3.45591460489564
introduction : results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non - cemented prostheses can , at the very least temporarily , be impaired by the application of non - steroidal antiphlogistic agents ( such as diclofenac ) .    3.5489581253319025
it is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages ( 3 times 50 mg daily ) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses .    3.315110070739107
methods : to investigate this , cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications .    2.9554877958756847
our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines .    3.1727769260900778
the measurable maximal plasma concentration UNK after the application of one tablet UNK 50 reached 1 . UNK / ml .    3.822802856687392
this correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments .    3.225330163349766
the detected values were correlated to the control group ( 0 µg / ml diclofenac ) .    3.6005881269703472
results : the drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells .    2.836321824134033
the proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells , compared to untreated cells , was found to be decreased .    3.5310935781743606
we observed a decrease to 82 % at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg / ml , osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97 , 5 % at the same concentration .    3.683250719144428
the dna synthesis increased to 118 % in stromal bone marrow cells , in osteoblasts to 144 % .    2.567244798133237
in contrast , we detected a UNK decrease to 92 % in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells .    3.087416090629325
the synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119 % .    2.7888806962366095
the alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88 % in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111 % .    2.9713729314624096
conclusion : temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non - cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism , exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression .    3.363612422156435
osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the UNK is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition .    3.9886788934306634
recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ( arteriosclerosis ) .    2.8802227586919584
atherosclerosis can apparently be the result of UNK , persistent infection by chlamydia pneumoniae and not the result of heterogenous risk factors .    4.128229272488588
the main arguments for chlamydial genesis are : correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against chlamydia pneumoniae .    2.9585580042949227
( 2 ) chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques ( pcr , icc , UNK , UNK , culture ) in a high percentage of UNK from different sites .    4.004437361775009
( 3 ) according to three successful international studies with UNK in coronary heart disease .    3.3753517216667928
( 4 ) target cells of atherosclerosis ( UNK , macrophages , muscle cells ) can be infected by chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro .    3.826059912305341
( 5 ) provocation of UNK in animal experiments .    4.118405445967979
( 6 ) the reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s , probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment .    3.3612677429079794
( 7 ) elevated levels of acute - phase proteins and other inflammatory signs ( crp , UNK count , UNK ) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs .    3.689166726198708
there are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis .    3.0641163699899128
the relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe .    3.3865031559754466
meticulous protocols and long - term monitoring of patients should be developed .    3.8811914631156674
the pre - and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow - up study to prepare a classification proposal .    3.5330639203205703
a differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal .    3.4199252330960817
the aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve .    3.5089626933976326
a total of 52 patients were examined .    2.9802345145820612
after the operation ( on average after 3 . 5 days following the trauma ) they were followed - up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule .    3.6136902637331008
preoperatively , 49 patients reported disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve .    2.6752577950657654
other symptoms , such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic UNK , were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients , respectively .    3.82470808590393
all fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically .    2.8485619016056773
the aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases .    3.187435449983672
six months postoperatively 41 patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve .    2.9589556184061743
in only five patients ( 10 . 2 % ) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow - up period .    3.676238418582603
patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative UNK in the following period .    3.3885081634512395
it can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which UNK aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim .    3.2013334498674086
an additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the UNK crista is not necessary .    3.327850033401792
a routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia .    3.7905919732532336
a zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic - / orbital floor fracture .    2.9697664938134536
chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life .    3.011376323619754
to date , this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life .    2.9515535050306263
headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the german language .    4.2406185087420765
in america , a headache specific questionnaire , the " headache disability inventory " ( UNK ) , has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a german version , the " UNK zur UNK UNK UNK " ( ibk ) .    4.363144959280842
94 consecutive patients with a primary headache disorder ( 59 female , 35 male ; mean age 40 + / - 12 years ) were examined .    4.2851075655868405
cronbach ' s alpha was a = 0 . 90 , the test - retest - reliability after three months was r = 0 . 87 .    3.4991296723792127
an analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test - retest - reliability of these subscales .    2.77130794765832
the scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly .    3.8037925742613075
in post - hoc - analyses , however , cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales .    3.7049138052014516
the total score of the ibk was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month ( r = 0 . 41 ; p < 0 . 0003 ) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters .    3.3927575306961835
the ibk is the first german headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients .    3.9511634435337
it can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies .    4.538119146706924
age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast .    3.5241081625619772
the aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and mr mammography .    2.9314811302340114
therefore , own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic mr mammography .    2.9576674948862376
literature data are used to correlate mammography and mr imaging findings with these influences .    3.9482294095573107
the changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and mr mammography .    2.897670405778164
the knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods .    3.251182181588945
finally , the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo .    3.0131801366547255
as part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on 128 . 225 dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism .    2.7689180600857215
appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures .    3.6858005417106536
accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non - specific appendicitis , however , suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be UNK by many other abdominal diseases .    4.699928057200335
the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis , therefore , can only be definitely confirmed by UNK analysis , the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper .    3.7132315225909873
special emphasis is given to distinct variants of acute appendicitis and the significance of UNK .    3.175223879751772
extra - articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint ( genu varum or valgum ) are treatments proven over many years .    3.1390483665783866
the middle and long term results shows many patients are very satisfied .    3.6021817671779237
unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores .    3.021905382306102
the good results by infra - and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first .    3.4539604656019134
the important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning , the miss load , and the instability of the joint ; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency .    3.6410007726098614
therefore , indication of infra - or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient .    3.01284785263293
the most important fact is the condition of the joint , especially the quality of bone , the instability of the joint , and the loss of bone .    4.6715764824348724
given the right indication , the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint .    3.334037847588191
also , there are still chances to do another operation , such a prothesis .    3.5109938415066817
a prothesis can be implanted if the osteotomy has no chance to preserve the joint .    3.1647516192175122
psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject , which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation .    3.469044437345213
differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations ( pes ) is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to UNK .    3.587822299692673
this article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine .    2.8711136485460056
a definition is offered to outline pes that require immediate medical intervention and crises due to psycho - social reasons .    2.8114382611374573
for the most important disturbances and syndromes the differential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies are presented .    3.915209339235312
acute pancreatitis is a UNK entity with rather diverse clinical courses .    3.7058908387103537
whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1 % , nowadays ; still approximately 20 % of all patients with the necrotizing form UNK to the disease .    3.8309629010636455
to further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used .    3.264338819754743
for effective treatment the differentiation between edematous and necrotizing pancreatitis is crucial .    3.399443721842644
all patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a ct - scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease .    3.1730570032035947
primarily all patients are treated conservatively .    3.9147021569029605
main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis .    3.4215117981653322
in cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence .    3.4851114666999163
objective : diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease .    3.0489707480612975
usually , characteristic x - ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease .    3.686270124095542
a 73 - year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ( hocm ) since 1989 .    3.493135896661357
after a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical UNK of the anterior wall , a previously measured gradient of 11 mm hg in the UNK is no longer detected .    4.328626410033347
as a consequence of this UNK , " pseudo - UNK " caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of hocm .    3.355968047983278
aim : intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes type i .    3.5330025830960734
intensified insulin therapy includes an basis - bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion , several times daily blood glucose self - monitoring , self - adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far - reaching UNK of nutrition .    3.054019848570226
the patients learn UNK of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program .    3.2636316169442283
the effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care .    3.738640810596923
the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40 ° ( cobb ) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment .    2.963491929121448
curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity , vertebral rotation , rigidity of the curve , the skeletal age , the age and sex of the patient , the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve .    3.549449649888405
in scoliosis over 40 ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period .    3.002481150430115
progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major UNK , especially in young patients ( UNK sign 0 and 1 ) .    4.109766332793527
the purpose of this study was to evaluate low - field magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist .    3.224141283747136
between august 1995 and may 1997 , 75 patients at the UNK UNK , mainz , germany , with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination , x - ray and mri imaging .    4.462617352938986
mri analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying mri experience without knowledge of the patient ' s history .    3.6457753663415504
the sensitivity and specifity of the more [ u1 ] and the less experienced [ u2 ] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100 % ( u1 ) and from 61 to 100 % ( u2 ) .    2.492259531207455
positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100 % ( u1 ) and from 58 to 100 % ( u2 ) ; accuracy ranged from 92 to 100 % ( u1 ) and from 77 to 100 % ( u1 ) .    2.243765610410231
in intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the ldl - cholesterol and an increase in hdl - cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death , angina or heart failure .    3.8091923342418323
changes of lifestyle can be effective , but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate .    3.209443770849362
dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years .    3.183187382568111
in departments of dermatology german - speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58 % from 1984 to 1991 .    3.1920082561022207
the increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked .    3.1596573247036206
out - patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties .    3.152848115273831
from 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40 . 6 % in the number of operative procedures they performed .    4.507781283129747
the importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future ; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin .    3.498221687758715
there is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance .    2.9982370885972913
intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) enables doppler measurement of mitral UNK pattern ( e / a ratio ) .    2.7258291719064895
the e / a ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation .    3.0668348178754883
in the present study we compared the time course of the e / a ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation ( ) assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) .    2.76034606228177
after ethical approval , 12 patients undergoing cabg surgery were studied .    3.341715461019098
measurements of the e / a ratio and were performed after induction of anesthesia ( i ) , immediately prior to cpb with the pericardium open ( ii ) , 5 min after cpb ( iii ) , and after sternal closure ( iv ) .    3.554423711272628
time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dp / UNK and left ventricular pressure UNK .    3.556680730097999
the e / a ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery ( iv ) .    2.876875842854429
in contrast , was increased immediately after cpb , but decreased after sternal closure ( iv ) .    2.3946639421776412
cardiac index and heart rate both increased after cpb .    3.367990636791624
the results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after cpb , as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation .    3.1675756695556596
however , improved rapidly to pre - cpb values .    3.196119237983985
the e / a ratio alone failed to detect the initial post - cpb alteration in left ventricular relaxation .    2.6944705192191236
acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells , mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol .    3.161174465587142
nk - cells react the most intensive , they can increase UNK after intensive exercise .    3.4543973012611495
additionally a weak acute - phase reaction occurs .    3.302855290283355
most of these changes normalize during twenty - four hours .    2.99270560027935
parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre - exercise levels up to seventy - two hours .    3.5050511716645145
repeated physical exercise , which is typical for sports , is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest .    3.536399312707152
epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j - shaped curve .    3.4285068443621323
moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection .    3.5481495733695008
for this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important .    3.304570945149334
especially after UNK exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue , which remove destructed tissue .    3.6092434991248146
not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues .    3.442159437546054
to achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of UNK a straight and solid septum , even in cases of marked deviations or severe post - traumatic deformities , we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a " compound graft " .    3.5503613581752616
for this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed , and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are UNK to each other to form a straight and solid plate .    3.2513681709646427
as connecting material we use a polydioxanon ( pds ) foil .    2.7939736939880073
the sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with pds suture material .    2.950938895268691
the compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose .    3.1564585439117283
during the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients .    3.447322284477116
the surgical goal was attained in every case , and no immediate or long - term complications occurred .    3.703505414690899
this method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better , significant correction of even severe septal deviations .    3.1584978668213193
two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical ( hpa ) axis .    2.4987175576042246
these glucocorticoid hormone binding receptors are the UNK receptor ( mr ) and the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) .    3.3877715919080273
UNK , a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges .    3.230464998595097
here , we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid UNK in mr density in the hippocampus ( a limbic structure highly involved in hpa axis regulation ) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge .    2.928091399312439
this rise in mr is accompanied by a stronger mr - mediated inhibitory control of the hpa axis .    3.507790535390795
thus , an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the hpa axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal mr .    3.1647971957778096
this novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress - related disorders .    3.8073757388498324
the wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain .    3.853203659419963
until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency ; in spite of this fact , neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency .    3.497251319111446
a metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed .    3.440972193452828
thirty - four , the majority of the studies , are case reports , retrospective analyses or non - randomised cohort studies .    3.5127191117462346
most of these reports UNK to a positive effect .    3.560776384348226
however , only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect .    2.9682039483497893
none of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used .    3.6133997418136508
the metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics .    3.178180976363292
studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset .    3.27769277109862
for most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy .    3.7292145858356984
many factors are responsible for this time delay : signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients , relatives and UNK and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff .    3.4514221382417185
although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window , this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education .    3.1988450939045356
for the future , we hope that emergency medical services ( ems ) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke .    3.1034725467926143
standard of care by the ems personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation , treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia .    3.7667558118434195
early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission , thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients .    3.1734097406636343
a decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or " wrapping " may lead to a partial loss of the arterial UNK - function .    3.641960000340089
the following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance .    3.1852871756565726
in 8 pigs , the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis .    3.384895241114543
this approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta , like extracorporal circulation , cardioplegia or blood loss .    3.030091820588076
flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention , and following fourier transformation , the aortic input impedance was calculated .    3.426143603094327
mean pressure , mean flow , and total peripheral resistance were unaltered , while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the " wrapping " procedure .    3.3021827563675443
thus , it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load .    3.6155393994767566
cervical UNK are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology .    3.6837874006071916
there are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists .    3.3858068799485714
if there is no reliable result , it is necessary to remove a lymph node .    3.529472820265969
we report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis x in lymph nodes .    2.875322882272008
a 63 - year - old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously .    3.3411616124821903
the preliminary examinations ( fnp / blood examinations ) revealed no pathological findings .    2.7336420266577495
only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis x .    3.958377610974683
systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations .    3.1697150980032904
the report demonstrates how to diagnose and treat this rare disease .    2.9446876852197805
we report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract .    3.6050867571542575
using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium UNK UNK UNK - acetic acid ( dtpa ) , we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography .    3.553526269144645
the major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization , the excretion of gadolinium - dtpa can be studied simultaneously .    2.7906994123731907
we demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases .    3.1105523105305743
histologically , these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local UNK parts of the trabeculae .    2.9133456570286427
using a preparation technique that allows combined two - and UNK analysis , 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus .    3.296980411146808
microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age .    2.991609007629284
they are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males .    3.2726422806016515
the number of microcallus formations depends more on the UNK of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters .    3.4210226581623124
in about 33 % of cases UNK are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation .    3.529248076951114
in noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus .    2.9744571087583807
it stabilizes and UNK the bone tissue .    4.112570872079622
furthermore , complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae .    2.607219656444152
osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus .    3.4937486136844162
dna cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis .    3.187658596844351
the detection of a dna - aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high - grade malignant bone neoplasm , even in small biopsies .    3.8443553195473528
solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have dna - diploid cell populations .    3.311085695596336
low - grade central osteosarcomas may show single - cell UNK of varying extent as well as a dna - diploid stemline .    3.5958271358206644
their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a dna - aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation .    3.0211077526168633
although noise in general can induce hearing loss , environmental noise represents an important risk for children , teenagers and young adults .    3.3525599540938726
epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups .    3.454946898724994
major causes of hearing loss are toys ( UNK ) , UNK and UNK amplified music delivered by head sets or UNK in UNK and open air UNK .    3.96564875297636
the development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint .    3.1972270770616356
one of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and UNK joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability .    3.726336105290012
state of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations .    3.6412741598517964
the arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools .    3.713504361573648
UNK lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery .    3.596896317142376
wernicke ' s encephalopathy ( we ) is a consequence of vitamin b1 ( thiamine ) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism .    3.8491618507391547
we report here the case of a 26 - year - old male alcoholic who had stayed UNK at home for 4 days until hospital admission .    3.054648720705797
clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness .    3.19937199837105
mri showed an increase in signal intensity ( t2 - , flair - weighted ) around the third ventricle , the UNK bodies , the UNK , the UNK bodies , the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the UNK .    3.699602332645859
these findings were indicative of we although of unusual extent .    2.6407437319942586
in this case mri correlated well with clinical symptomatology .    2.9865985830995663
therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as mri findings resolved partially .    3.6750732463684237
the presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of mri in we especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited .    3.2356767234563106
background : UNK UNK examination after the extraction of choroidal UNK membranes ( cnv ) in age - related macular degeneration ( UNK ) shows absolute UNK in the area of pigment epithelial loss .    3.5948056856063073
laser treatment also causes complete functional loss .    2.939174013643978
the functional results of these two methods should be compared before the surgical procedure is expanded .    3.7944850007290647
three case reports of a UNK and an UNK vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented .    3.9083135951889476
neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination , laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques .    3.4324733597554284
arthroscopy of the knee joint permits both diagnostic evaluation and low - risk surgical treatment .    3.6307531801692794
strabismus surgery in children is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( ponv ) .    3.4705510840195135
we report on a case of a 23 years old man who was polytraumatized in a car accident .    2.874476496070061
he survived with excellent clinical outcome , but after 113 days after the accident he collapsed , massive bleeding out of the UNK started and the patient died within a few minutes .    4.334949097211924
a gastric ulcer bleeding was assumed , but autopsy showed the UNK - in of a posttraumatic aortic aneurysm into the esophagus .    3.4406159535060725
the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia ( ol ) in hiv - positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of candida hyphae and viral infections ( hsv 1 , 2 , hpv , ebv and cmv ) by immunocytochemical methods using mono - or polyclonal antibodies .    2.9643941177685056
a total of 269 hiv - seropositive patients , ( 222 men , median age 36 . 7 years and 47 women , median age 32 years ) were registered .    3.3357360362013018
ol occurred in 20 / 269 ( 7 . 4 % ) patients ( men , smokers , median age 38 years ) ; the non - homogeneous form was observed in 11 % .    3.995396368079999
a lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8 / 20 patients .    3.319908986850232
specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia .    3.8456545983658246
candida hyphae were evident in 2 / 8 cases .    3.6824682504245834
two patients tested positive for hpv and cmv ; antibodies against ebv , UNK and 2 were negative .    3.3715467585446577
in conclusion , the prevalence of ol is comparatively high in this group of hiv - seropositive patients ( 7 . 4 % vs . 0 . 9 - 2 . 2 % ) .    3.7055515433864405
moreover , the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for ol was lower ( 38 years vs . 60 years ) .    3.6132225365598525
damage / dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) in sepsis and sirs .    3.356077361275834
this acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance , although about 10 % of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure .    3.3009492532420124
this potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure , not primarily ischemic , with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced ; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance .    3.218990372649253
damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ards .    3.674683103804327
sirs - cardiomyopathy in non - infectious mods has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy .    3.558081099944668
the pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and sirs is multifactorial , the endotoxin / tnf / no / cgmp - cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis .    2.874725316619836
therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and sirs - cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic ( volume substitution , inotropic / vasoactive agents ) ; causal therapeutic principles are , however , put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment .    3.2283447182538287
fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle .    3.399282789033038
intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation , with good ultimate functional outcome .    3.5330525338518957
between january 1993 and december 1995 , a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed .    3.396597082150881
all the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis , and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures .    3.300082280187523
there were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46 . 4 + / - 12 . 7 years ( range 21 - 90 ) .    3.672253258899697
in most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate .    3.626205602008332
therefore a new classification according to robinson et al .    2.8252005966081133
this fracture type was defined as type ii d for use in this study .    3.50297322355709
the severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the gustilo system in case of open ( n = 19 ) and the UNK system in case of closed fractures ( n = 30 ) .    4.4713499659949365
in 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula , which was first UNK using a plate .    3.751700164350938
for reconstruction of the distal articular surface , covered screw osteosynthesis was done .    4.054628306215944
at the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally .    2.9399869042747073
from january 1993 to february 1994 , the reamed ao standard nail was used .    2.654385313657924
after introduction of the unreamed tibial nail ( utn ) all fractures were treated by this implant .    3.3808234645290356
full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks .    3.3906890081518664
union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria .    4.561206128312176
UNK was defined as more than 5 ° of angular rotation .    3.6342039240274087
further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases .    4.292229692729088
there were no deep infections .    2.920295451729351
a leg shortening was found in 4 cases , but it was less than 1 cm in every case .    4.207779783269229
therefore , surgical correction was not done .    3.274869407996288
patients were reviewed at intervals of 2 , 6 , and 12 weeks , and after 6 , and at least 12 months .    4.124940516582503
all 49 patients were finally reviewed after an average time of 15 . 7 months ( range 12 - 38 ) .    3.768971325268161
bone fusion was reached 12 . 8 weeks ( range 9 - 21 ) after the operative treatment .    3.592654447389755
a specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of olerud and molander ( 1984 ) .    3.417490008133392
in 29 patients excellent results were recorded .    3.202042886842977
a satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory .    3.254705455336896
although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis , closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation .    2.9141522618179936
the major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques .    2.92697672933729
therefore , closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture .    2.6578120352040284
the lesion shows UNK hyperplasia or acanthosis and , given its rarity , may be confused with cancer .    3.187290499115973
in the present paper we report on a 56 - year - old male patient who presented with UNK .    2.80028368073877
physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords .    3.354179470292412
the clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient ( ten UNK of UNK and 40 UNK per day ) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer .    4.431376460963969
the histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma ; however , it could not provide a clear diagnosis .    3.7976058428465795
as the lesion progressed , further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis .    3.500983002582035
systemic antimycotic treatment with UNK and amphotericin caused a complete remission .    3.982065761665757
lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum , irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor .    3.4482733520194477
metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions , but this is unpredictable .    3.27013301045785
the number of lymph nodes in each position varies .    2.912056439361353
therefore , systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum .    2.8399474577169688
it is also possible to reach contralateral sites .    3.125957372536567
in right - sided UNK the lymph node dissection is standardized .    3.664004930705095
UNK the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left - sided approach .    3.0113030754094403
the surgical technique is described .    3.0103789636300475
perioperative morbidity does not increase .    3.3037175701743724
systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pn stage .    3.1444250022396885
the stage - related survival rate is significantly improved .    3.315694399303233
therefore , it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma .    3.5069528372038192
in the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and UNK - orchitis .    4.027950322250958
a special case of a thirty - eight - year - old male UNK from UNK was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain .    3.6766573825836577
to exclude testicular torsion , a diagnostic exploration of the UNK was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation .    4.101745740847287
under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared .    3.102970662453108
the diagnosis of UNK funiculitis was made after identifying the UNK in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood UNK .    3.8903690736155063
a UNK medication with UNK UNK was administered with good symptomatic relief .    3.814361718139752
we studied 10 patients with parkinson ' s disease and 12 patients with parkinson - plus - syndrome , trying to improve patients ' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli , including metronome stimulation ( 96 beats per minute = middle UNK ) .    3.086559520169036
the test course of the patients was UNK meters and 3 u - turns .    3.925470524636878
the patients ' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk ( velocity , number of steps , number of freezing episodes ) .    3.1221424540445306
metronome stimulation significantly reduced the time and number of steps needed for the test course and also diminished the number of freezing episodes .    3.77790076788327
march music stimulation was less effective and UNK stimulation ( UNK UNK on the patient ' s shoulder ) even produced negative results .    4.0228708092780705
the positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found , when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building , but outside in the hospital UNK .    3.2698961351413143
metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub - groups examined in this study ( m . parkinson , parkinson - plus - syndrome ) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients .    3.5074587088502147
UNK UNK are not expensive , easy in handling , and portable .    3.297958825539916
a theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with parkinson ' s disease still needs to be elucidated .    3.649846186444526
the occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy .    3.111969298765928
chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion .    3.4825413610174314
the important criteria for differential diagnosis are neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells or their UNK morphology without UNK .    3.503440737901627
objectives repair of acute rupture of the achilles tendon through a percutaneous technique under general , regional , or local anesthesia .    3.2098062267659224
deciduosis of the appendix is a rare cause of acute appendicitis in pregnancy .    3.759917388953641
ectopic decidual cells localized in the submesothelial stroma may represent a physiologic reaction of the pluripotent stromal cells to UNK hormonal stimulation .    3.138709050417953
less frequently , deciduosis is based on a preexisting extragenital UNK , visible in a localization other than strictly submesothelial , in residuals of cyclic proliferation and bleeding , and in endometrial glandular formations embedded in the decidual cells .    3.0224856434290923
in 14 patients with acute lbp the effect of manual therapy was examined .    3.53109695563956
the examination was conducted with the triflexometer , which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine .    3.5920939006067396
this instrument makes possible the measurement of the spine in resting as well as in moving positions , and it is also suitable for recording local disturbances of the movement .    3.8598668556326103
in our study we measured the spine from c7 to UNK in the sagittal and frontal planes .    3.2791021255547603
our study shows that the triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute lbp .    3.086300523511725
the proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute lbp or perhaps of chronic lbp , and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms .    3.4105267840421085
diagnostic imaging after renal transplantation is of high importance in the differential diagnosis of peri - and postoperative complications .    3.3334954044140868
sonography with color duplex imaging is the method of choice in the diagnosis of acute transplant rejection .    3.5252321285708
mri is an additional method in the diagnosis of transplant dysfunction especially in diagnosis of UNK fluid UNK .    4.233513857294626
mr angiography and mr urography are noninvasive diagnostic modalities with the potential to replace angiography and UNK .    3.12090120234091
angiography , complemented by carbon dioxide angiography , still is the gold standard in the diagnosis of transplant artery stenosis .    3.475185714404662
nutrients and trophic factors independent of nutritional substrates influence the proliferation and the differentiation of the cells that make up the intestinal wall .    3.4811184974871074
the resorptive mucosa must be differentiated from immunologically active cells of the " gut - associated lymphatic tissue " ( UNK ) .    3.4164553730756224
UNK is the main oxidative substrate of UNK and an important nitrogen donor ; its importance becomes apparent in very sick patients .    3.418012081124745
the amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of no and UNK synthesis .    2.8680537985394268
complex UNK are fermented in the lower gut UNK to short - chain fatty acids , mainly acetic , UNK and UNK acid .    3.806925966902655
the trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow .    3.634811201814359
among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones UNK and UNK and various growth factors , contributing to the maintenance of a UNK gut mucosa .    3.959430383863874
we investigated 88 patients with a total of 102 angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded duplex sonography ( tccd ) during a time period of 15 months .    3.279199939429227
both the size and teh localization of teh UNK were determined .    2.976996660781116
seventy aneurysms ( 77 % ) with a diameter of 16 + / - 8 mm ( 6 - UNK ) were detectable , with excellent visualization in 36 ( 42 % ) , moderate visualization in 34 ( 40 % ) , and no sufficient visualization in 16 ( 16 % ) aneurysms , respectively .    4.132778237812742
in another 16 cases ( 16 % ) there was no sufficient UNK window .    3.579671570269091
thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16 / 20 cases ( 75 % ) , visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12 / 25 patients ( 48 % ) .    3.38416147098054
tccd allows the follow up of cerebral aneurysms , with the detection of thrombosis and treatment effects after embolization .    4.474881496929
the method is not valid for the detection of intracranial aneurysms    3.9571285065231177
the authors report the case of a young patient suffering from plasmacellular osteomyelitis of the thoracic spine , a unusual localisation of this type of chronic osteomyelitis .    3.2787524643789574
they discuss the role of imaging diagnostic modalities in this disease , focussing on mri .    3.8966318832140434
the heidelberg retina tomograph ( hrt ) is a new instrument to analyze the three - dimensional structure of the retina .    3.926420311287124
it is based on confocal laser scanning technology .    3.3728751845428904
scientific interest has so far focused on the follow - up of glaucomatous optic nerve head damage .    3.4956247715108835
as parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be UNK with a high degree of accuracy , this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk .    3.6219010491517065
evaluation of three patients , aged between three months and five years because of failure to thrive and persistent diarrhea revealed the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth .    3.5024737167874553
a combination of a typical history , endoscopy , laboratory , radiological and histological methods as well as the breath hydrogen test were used .    3.4563870146006157
the third patient was suffering from UNK UNK ' s disease .    3.2728817392001024
all patients gained weight and reported less complaints after antibiotic treatment with metronidazole .    2.9315120525691034
discussion : small bowel bacterial overgrowth has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive , especially in cases with preexisting intestinal disease .    3.374409771728665
the diagnosis may be substantiated by a combination of indirect methods .    3.5222113603864416
direct UNK analysis is difficult .    3.5179742705551362
usually , antibiotic treatment leads to a good weight gain after a short period of time .    3.1141891581014383
in contrast to carotid endarterectomy , the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized .    3.4152471849490533
the diagnostic procedures included dsa , cct , mri , 24 h ecg , otoneurological , and neurological examination , and ultrasonic flow measurement .    2.8868128220808296
we compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients .    3.5159316916288086
two different surgical procedures were used : transposition of the vertebral artery to the cca or graft implantation between cca and atlas loop .    3.083088085548352
the validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement .    2.8282169891341042
in our opinion , exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery .    2.776689569327633
it has long been a goal to develop a means to measure UNK angles in three dimensions simultaneously .    3.1642976036744312
a three - dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility .    2.995309388879751
in situations of depressed myocardial function , the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently .    3.8369936997000416
in different pathophysiological situations , such as chronic heart failure , open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation , cardiac transplantation , myocardial infarction and angina pectoris , patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor - , interleukin - 1 , interleukin - 6 , and reversible myocardial dysfunction , which may represent a final common pathway .    3.8688546723002926
the available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function , i . e . , contractility , preload , afterload , and heart rate , by cytokines .    2.9953218862646476
potential mechanisms include the - adrenoceptor - and nitric oxide pathway , as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis .    3.341135886465883
interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge .    3.3005466401390553
a total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups .    2.610520210659352
the first group was permitted to UNK postoperatively , allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water , the second group was UNK to keep the incision dry .    3.143561151895007
water contact , wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed .    3.690048833230193
there was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection .    3.0526439324106907
in children and adolescents motor / vocal tics and obsessive - compulsive behavior are known to be closely related .    2.6887233687841454
thereby , a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics / UNK / obsessive - compulsive traits to clinically relevant UNK and UNK could be described .    3.320619371664472
as neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding UNK - UNK - thalamo - cortical circuits ( sensorimotor circuit in UNK symptomatology , orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive - compulsive behavior ) were postulated .    2.8933665835145184
for both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to UNK tics and obsessive - compulsive behavior , respectively , and psychopharmacological agents can be UNK to compensate UNK in neurotransmitter systems .    3.1819967982668533
in case of a mixed UNK picture it is necessary to include interventions for both UNK of the symptom - continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient .    3.8315974694776216
as laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established , interest in legal aspects increases .    3.0913298156135376
the legal cases dealt with in germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications .    3.3908322312270864
of 40 cases , 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice , whereas 24 were not .    2.869486072595151
the most common cause was injury of the common bile duct ( 26 cases ) .    3.0855867458994144
seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice , 2 of these as grave errors .    2.887961926431204
the main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy , delayed revision , laparoscopic revisions and not UNK to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations .    3.0712046822522385
purpose of this review is , to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation .    3.071877569930041
there is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation , brain death concept , donor consent and organ allocation .    3.3446629084811996
transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability .    3.639206148603415
organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy .    2.8650257901843386
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year , my be sufficient , to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases .    3.232455846097677
this frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing " split techniques " , where one liver is used for two recipients .    3.3383977740511814
one year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 % , one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 % .    2.98816087756038
the risk of organ failure is highest in the first year , long term results are dependent on incidence of chronic rejection , comorbidity of the patient and original disease .    3.852711026441638
patient - and / or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 % .    4.453458410094963
whole organ transplantation for kidneys , hearts and UNK are considered routine procedures , lung transplantation is reaching standard phase , pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically , but its indication is still controversial .    3.1775505588396586
laser - induced interstitial thermotherapy ( litt ) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors .    3.0756048303561845
to increase the effectiveness of litt , a new thermo - controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed .    3.8462365027567147
this laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter , insertion equipment and an UNK : yag laser source .    3.694711968187653
the power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by UNK in a water - cooling system of the laser applicator .    3.764476616810392
in in vivo experiments in five pigs , within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter .    3.4538265083803834
however , due to perifocal edema , the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound .    2.9297794848084293
macroscopically and microscopically , the coagulation zones showed well - demarcated borders of the coagulation lesions , and the surrounding tissue appeared vital .    3.6981669645625495
the reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis .    3.100690897817569
in the course of 4 weeks , the surrounding scar capsule , containing fibrocytes , biliary UNK and collagen fibers enlarged .    3.073799501640072
as a result , the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed .    2.8626775021216653
the absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo - controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable .    3.6102514238645127
attachment theory , originally developed by john UNK , becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy ( research ) .    3.1570476540917447
this review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment , mainly from research in developmental UNK .    3.2109064430402148
related to adults , attachment theory has to be UNK which is done in another part of this paper .    4.3544102738673445
finally , some common methods for the assessment of adult attachment are described which play an important role in clinical studies ( these will be the content of the part 2 of this review ) .    3.570449616382885
inflammation - mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation .    3.3320120935344755
we found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process , in addition cytokines are increased .    3.500497461309451
treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation .    3.3327544035094046
UNK with drugs and UNK are both recognised methods of preoperative preparation .    3.615123025798007
the beneficial effects of UNK , however , appear to be difficult to prove .    5.349409456486837
in this study a comparison was made of heart rate ( hr ) , blood pressure ( bp ) , and norepinephrine , epinephrine , and cortisol levels .    3.296507771181904
in group i 19 children recieved only psychological treatment , while in group ii 21 children received 0 . 2 mg / kg midazolam orally .    3.360851425504285
measuring points were directly before medication , 30 min UNK , and at induction of anaesthesia .    3.8815876026498906
during the observation period the patients ( 5 - 10 years old ) remained UNK .    4.267476713952481
at the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range ; 30 min after premedication the hr and bp were significantly higher in group i than in group ii .    3.837244715829588
in contrast to group i , epinephrine levels in group ii were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication .    3.6195922800554987
in both groups , norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication .    2.996261925832056
cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam .    4.69850986849435
hr , bp , as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children .    3.6887109516902314
a case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented .    2.909172741649873
the diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging .    3.1571606318930043
the diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of UNK UNK in the pericardial fluid .    3.893050732108818
this is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy .    3.184130742098258
myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of UNK masses visualized at echocardiography .    2.996108337859843
the incidence of hepatitis a infections has decreased due to improved UNK conditions in germany .    3.117796646564958
currently , more than the half of all registered hepatitis a infections are acquired in foreign countries .    3.0655124472910225
according to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people ( age below 50 years ) are not UNK and , subsequently , this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries .    3.2886662413881838
therefore , a hepatitis a vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis a ( southern europe , africa , south america , and asia ) .    2.8620494697690515
lactic acid bacteria ( lab ) are a group of gram - positive organism , which have in common a UNK metabolism with lactic acid as the major end - product .    3.3475946685552467
except for bifidobacteria , the lab are UNK closely related .    2.95592404873114
they directly contribute to human well - being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented UNK which constitute one fourth of our diet .    3.553154190200261
they are , furthermore , an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora .    3.3808272053536474
the intestinal flora contains such species of the genus UNK that are also important in food UNK and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore , can be found exclusively in this ecological niche .    3.4441675864956247
a special status UNK bifidobacteria and enterococci .    2.990691921371895
the former are located in a separate phylogenetic branch and also occur virtually exclusively in the intestines .    3.092526833329344
enterococci are rather ubiquitous , participate in UNK food fermentations , are found in the mucosal flora and are UNK as opportunistic pathogens .    3.2594433321865535
to influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects lab are isolated from the intestinal flora , grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or UNK to food ( usually fermented milk ) .    2.975608186543146
these bacteria are termed " probiotics " .    3.1303285575065662
the exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health .    2.9416168449844418
in this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion .    3.362221811623897
in front of this background , lab in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe , nevertheless some restrictions have to be made .    3.6128189631958834
in addition they should not produce UNK UNK ( e . g .    3.190904583002525
histamine , tyrosine or UNK ) and should not UNK UNK .    4.490709153487676
these examinations may be required as certain lab have been identified in clinical isolates .    3.4501408064404466
the isolates were , however , obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients .    4.229512983628383
the germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment , organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated .    3.4356146432859913
dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon .    3.581326747778863
due to the nonspecific symptomatology , as well as the UNK etiology , clinical diagnosis may be difficult .    3.4632664137065285
in these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat .    2.972168827326396
the aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical ct in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis .    2.6720142861513487
in 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis ct angiography was performed .    3.202411081857996
in 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed .    3.1736734001189872
in order to acquire also arterial vessels , a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected .    3.5794681815712655
by this method we found an occlusion of the mca in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis .    3.6359148870582567
in all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an " empty delta " sign .    2.7460893840858795
with irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus .    3.597634514896105
the mip reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage .    3.7031549566191773
in three patients mr angiograms were available for comparison .    3.1317685931503805
the smaller veins , such as the v . UNK inferior , were less clearly depicted than in ct angiography .    3.4536407233074686
ct angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis .    2.9717347469481603
it can be performed immediately after non - enhanced ct .    3.593480485958855
according to our present experience ct angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis .    3.2628349347713383
coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease .    3.634488238687645
only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries , however .    3.098868948845111
with intravascular ultrasound , on the other hand , pathological changes in the vascular wall can be recorded .    3.533159691078418
despite typical symptoms , an UNK image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries .    3.6121813178197493
in such cases , intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings .    2.7652460391393037
two cases are used to illustrate this .    3.4465004062312627
in those , angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms , yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes .    3.0199586363546405
purpose : the pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex , but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear .    2.8158771805749314
the cerebral cortex is involved in UNK micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions .    3.08731179335791
the present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by eeg power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned .    2.9837070369654954
we also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation ( UNK ) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity .    3.984196707089281
background : indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe , potential vision - threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment .    2.94381826508976
in general , any therapy has been dis - UNK controversially in the literature .    2.876594415123181
based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma , high - dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma .    3.242317120631754
the usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle .    3.823416426818836
in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock - like syndrome ( tsls ) in otherwise healthy adults .    2.8085564451261686
it is characterized by fever , rash , hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 % .    3.1439358360414063
this paper describes the history of two patients with severe streptococcal tsls .    3.7778703498128445
various aspects of the pathophysiology , diagnosis and therapy are discussed .    3.8637526813165035
only early , aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating UNK and thereby , in combination with antibiotic therapy , decrease the high mortality of this entity .    3.5470105324334766
purpose : to test , whether axial , coronal and sagittal mip and UNK reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1 - mm collimation msct data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology .    3.406069305631566
the risk to health UNK by a UNK lifestyle is a problem of our times .    3.808061302166587
in contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high - intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health - related benefits , recent studies have shown that even everyday UNK ( UNK UNK , UNK walking and cycling ) can have a UNK effects on health , particularly in those who take little exercise .    3.436091915428104
so now the recommendation is : exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week , corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 UNK / day or 1000 UNK / week .    2.9907509594321424
the results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the UNK of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle .    3.292686900492267
for one thing , it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis : for another , sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass , UNK delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life .    3.226808940957925
the new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health - giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement .    3.0125454142428945
a model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes , and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling ( UNK model ) , can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy .    3.5852091339909156
depending on whether an individual is inactive , or sporadically or regularly active , each one UNK his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle .    2.9256482662496293
assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity , the patient ' s attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically .    3.667195351457647
background : UNK keratectomy ( prk ) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide .    3.15662774201676
the central corneal thickness is reduced due to removal of the anterior stroma , including UNK ' s layer , with a laser beam .    4.424160466670116
this procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure .    3.1815387444425145
what does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea ?    3.618473764172439
beginning in the UNK UNK reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body - oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis .    3.7475213869775232
he started from considerations of UNK , sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns .    3.9239692990392445
UNK and bodily attitudes were understood as defence - patterns against emotions , which function not only psychologically but also bodily .    2.7093131737273484
thus he began to UNK repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions .    2.8795712438284737
that way their meaning in the person ' s history could be understood and a self - healing process UNK .    3.4038214631300274
this approach to release constrained energy is still valid for UNK schools such as bioenergetics , UNK , UNK and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy .    3.2284406982042624
bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and UNK of therapies .    4.364994516954374
besides there are impulses in modern body UNK to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts .    3.1802329278760877
recurrent UNK in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes .    3.062353387579158
the most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin iii , protein c , and protein s , and activated protein c resistance ( mutations of factor v ) .    2.927646572286679
less frequently , UNK , increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels , or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor ii may be found .    3.2469004217130046
klinefelter ' s syndrome and UNK are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals .    3.4719598164293144
early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment , preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members .    3.508590568643716
epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct UNK of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning .    3.7774745619490626
there is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected .    3.386057179928543
results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens , epiduroscopy , and conventional and computed tomographic ( ct ) epidurography are sometimes contradictory .    3.18491290988896
we have performed ct epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date .    2.979427103905565
insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features , such as the " UNK - road - track phenomenon " or the plica mediana dorsalis .    3.4606147376140415
patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied .    3.1755465692192537
catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation .    3.2080890808119498
conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile x - ray apparatus , usually in the recovery room , using 5 ml iopamidol ( UNK 250 m ) .    3.198918414986389
selected patients ( good mental state and stable psychic condition ) , after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee , were investigated with ct epidurography using the same contrast medium ( partly UNK ) .    3.2798050362150106
from among the ct scans performed until now , five characteristic images are presented and compared to conventional epidurographies .    3.8647529386965727
when small volumes ( 5 ml ) of iopamidol were injected slowly , we regularly observed a railroad - track phenomenon in the ap images of conventional epidurographies .    2.9154842350375403
after rapid injection of larger volumes ( 10 - 15 ml ) , the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a UNK zone of contrast distribution in the midline .    3.651565778079297
ct epidurography in these cases ( 5 out of 30 patients ) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis .    3.332932092997306
in the majority of the ct scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior ( ventral ) compartment was UNK by contrast medium .    3.240573981837825
according to the findings of several investigators , dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together , so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal .    3.037637964145238
in lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate , and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium .    3.2814593289084386
in other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled , but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths , as if these structures , together with the connective tissue strands between them , formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane .    3.0616354271100077
a railroad - track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the x - ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space , indicating an incorrect catheter position .    3.3988906214966166
according to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by ct scans , this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position .    3.4364226188907985
small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral UNK , whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the UNK and UNK , allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space .    3.762508864467192
this rhythmic widening and narrowing of the epidural space is the explanation of the " railroad track " in ap contrast epidurographies .    3.305023902930871
ct epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid ( contrast medium , local anaesthetics ) , UNK findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens .    3.245000153862995
it stands to reason that this time - and cost - expensive method can never replace conventional epidurographies , but can help to interpret them properly .    3.2878899721693675
a 71 - year - old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft x - ray therapy ( total dose 28 gy , half dose depth 10 . 5 - 11 . 5 mm ) .    3.487145654387274
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed .    3.6670811488013753
this unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy , presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens .    3.4004159047208278
in this case it is UNK that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy , as has been reported on several occasions in the literature .    3.178610244402005
however , this possibility cannot be entirely excluded .    2.687693347494851
a vascular etiology of parkinson ' s disease ( pd ) has been long debated .    3.1694791138072884
in order to search for an ischemic basis of pd we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 pd patients and UNK their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors , carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age - matched groups of stroke patients and normals .    3.162537123490828
the frequencies of carotid stenoses , ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with " pure " pd and normals .    3.4874048251852714
only one ( 1 . 6 % ) individual with pd presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism .    3.298190960475385
these findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with pd , but seldomly is causally related .    3.2239686794614735
neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis .    3.955214463076171
the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis .    3.1112858710966393
the mri brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed , along with the clinical information provided in the request form .    3.172826402967226
all patients had signs and symptoms UNK to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement .    3.8780394510161864
cranial ( facial ) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients .    3.664606513224454
a wide spectrum of mr findings was noted : UNK and white matter lesions on t2 w spin echo images , mimicking multiple sclerosis ( 46 % ) ; multiple supratentorial and UNK brain lesions , mimicking metastases ( 36 % ) ; solitary intraaxial mass , mimicking high - grade astrocytoma ( 9 % ) ; solitary UNK mass , mimicking UNK ( 5 % ) ; leptomeningeal enhancement ( 36 % ) .    3.333662494948282
the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult , particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis .    3.185328405233675
mri shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis .    3.1030996617880904
in selected cases with isolated brain involvement , meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required .    3.1490426349766127
in 1990 , we first described the papular - purpuric " gloves and socks " syndrome ( ppgss ) .    2.282136025030614
it is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever .    2.7895134475862378
the skin lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days .    2.8447739632659736
in more than half of the patients , an acute parvovirus b 19 infection has been proven .    3.342823857369133
in a few cases of ppgss , other viral infections have been found , for example hepatitis b and measles .    3.5247475472719754
we report on a patient with ppgss and review the literature .    2.550110523773357
fungus - UNK in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe candida albicans infection .    3.8170849493007344
a newborn infant with UNK - association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after candida albicans sepsis , and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure .    3.0204406552319516
following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin b and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin b via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly .    3.25114441571666
discussion : since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of UNK should include fungus balls .    3.5879581787729773
interactional understanding in psychoanalysis , especially the concept of the ' third point ' , suggests that the development of insight , UNK and relationship are dimensions of one and the same UNK process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding .    4.087505879483238
the formula ' interpretation on the basis of countertransference ' describes a form of psychoanalytic interpretation that takes up this context intentionally and can thus also be used for crisis intervention in the case of neurotic conflicts .    3.5497026509518235
this is exemplified by a case history .    3.4207207078885467
the UNK supreme court ruled that in exceptional instances , physician - assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness .    2.8754394136664465
some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described .    2.8734382446504374
psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician - assisted suicide is relatively rare .    3.0761872681032196
pemphigus is a rare UNK autoimmune bullous disease .    4.298193087562821
two major variants , pemphigus vulgaris ( pv ) and pemphigus UNK ( pf ) , are distinguished .    3.1240318818190445
the aim of this study was to document the clinical and UNK findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the department of dermatology at the university of würzburg over the past 10 years .    3.434828595248474
post - dural puncture headache ( pdph ) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia .    3.6640324050513873
diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient ' s age have been proven to be important determinants .    4.169934008022064
the question of whether post - operative recumbency can reduce the risk of pdph has not been answered uniformly .    3.575844287930507
and besides , some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures , for example , as to clear definition and exact documentation of post - operative immobilization .    3.2388267760116403
furthermore , fine - gauge needles ( UNK or more ) have not been investigated yet .    3.1643356629693886
the first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of pdph under controlled conditions using thin needles .    3.477820591928344
secondly , we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified , atraumatic tip ( UNK and UNK ) by comparing them to quincke needles of identical diameter .    3.296452784362258
most of the former investigators compared quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on pdph .    3.4007582263462317
three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion : .    3.2903560023729153
background : neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system .    3.2037552304024706
the pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain ( smp ) .    2.5741017109237334
typical disorders with a smp component are complex regional pain syndromes ( reflex sympathetic dystrophy and UNK ) , traumatic UNK and herpes zoster .    3.4527730485621304
the tendency towards sphincter - preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a UNK of the technique of coloanal anastomosis ( caa ) in recent years .    3.4101045191882533
in order to improve functional results , creation of a colonic j - pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis ( cpa ) was proposed .    2.708185417156034
two different operation techniques exist : i ) double - stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii ) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line .    3.0035671459650315
a long rectal remnant after double - stapling leads to UNK in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the UNK remnant .    3.9492558813660597
no UNK motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is UNK UNK by upper colonic UNK .    3.2328441886304957
therefore colonic pouches should be UNK of descending colon and should not exceed a length of 6 cm in order to prevent stool fragmentation .    3.6566510892350643
under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2 - 6 / d after caa to 1 - 3 / d after cpa .    3.2994048102266516
this effect is maximal during the first postoperative months , but is still significant after 3 years .    3.301468761708857
colonic pouch construction also leads , due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas , to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10 , 0 % after caa to 5 , 4 % after cpa .    3.7688605653164378
therefore creation of a colonic j - pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter - preserving procedure .    2.6708962129876577
background : workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co - carcinogenic agents .    3.073078006474258
these latter substances include asbestos , tar products , metal dust , wood dust , cement dust and UNK .    2.7019898611010436
presently , there are no well - defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies .    3.59964962599129
nevertheless , standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication , both essential for quality management in echocardiography .    3.2942753161103497
embolia cutis medicamentosa ( UNK syndrom ) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area .    3.57053453842052
intra - arterial and / or para - arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms .    3.52417210709117
we describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra - articular injections into the knee .    3.0606329704573145
in a 30 - beds - unit of the orthopedic university clinic in bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period .    3.357155010875868
there have been done 191 injections into UNK joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine .    3.056456383312892
on the other side there have been done 122 UNK maneuvers at cervical , thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine .    2.677234047061307
the injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain , the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas .    3.8143666461046846
the growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well , but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy .    3.7300859797334103
after birth , they developed a withdrawal syndrome ( neonatal abstinence syndrome ) .    3.0433685699963178
fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards .    3.1467588180018984
the group of opiate - exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment ( n = 48 ) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program ( n = 51 ) .    3.2642226072456664
the methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight ( UNK g ) than children in the group without methadone ( UNK g ) .    3.556427029477066
the abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group ( convulsions 47 . 1 % ) than in heroin - exposed babies without methadone treatment ( convulsions 27 . 1 % ) .    3.086986620815305
women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate - addicted women without methadone substitution .    2.876834941798934
moreover , they cared significantly better for their babies : 81 . 3 % of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90 . 9 % cared adequately .    3.3974888613268557
the data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate - exposed babies .    3.3952545868653057
neurofibromatosis type 1 ( nf1 ) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high UNK and variable expression .    3.6471774745360768
epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking .    2.900643889674361
up until now 74 patients with nf1 have been treated at the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of the university of hamburg .    3.0878331788376365
forty - two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site .    4.01926083932726
surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction , frequently combined with face - lifting .    2.852471199812619
in our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo - encapsulated , facilitating the preparation of the tumour .    3.1037458304149146
on the other hand , identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected .    2.6215458896212636
objective : the revised UNK - UNK valve was introduced onto the market in june 1990 .    3.4211587955721208
in september 1993 , the UNK changed the name of the valve to UNK , which is a low profile , UNK , mechanical prosthesis with a self - irrigating UNK mechanism .    4.554042671729465
the results of a prospective follow - up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented .    3.3008200316020893
a granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus .    4.076273095508624
we present the case of a 65 - year - old male patient , who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy .    2.7789937450077176
in the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found .    3.3197537257808682
repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis , although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded .    3.329462238612553
after indicating the operative therapy , the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach .    3.4508004887652928
the histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus ( tumor of abrikossoff ) .    3.1205948266787953
since the tumor grade was unknown , our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures .    3.425733440022732
there has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject , including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime , with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment .    3.8337428055279683
the case is discussed with a review of the literature .    2.8796911543444645
this review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients .    3.2055907025040598
acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease .    3.272435167652033
typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated .    3.479490250346943
the appropriate ancillary tests are presented .    2.9321071146929607
psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years , but for severely ill patients , often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care , the situation remains unsatisfactory .    3.4099080878945793
community - based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care .    3.267648130911988
the quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined , and many patients end up in UNK or homeless UNK unable to provide for their psychiatric needs .    2.900959381383923
neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet .    3.2726732112551744
a diagnostic scoring system , recently published by UNK et al .    2.9916636642847965
in this journal , was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2 , 359 patients , admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis .    2.9427169360715792
the results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior ( provisional ) and senior surgeons ( final clinical diagnosis ) .    3.137073851116516
to assess the diagnostic ability of the score , the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters ; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters .    3.766050716106028
of 2 , 359 patients admitted for suspected acute appendicitis , UNK were proven to have acute appendicitis by histology , for a prevalence of 28 % .    3.5159836221138745
the overall sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0 . 50 , 0 . 94 , 0 . 77 , 0 . 83 , and 0 . 82 ; 0 . 93 , for the score 0 . 63 , 0 . 93 , 0 . 77 , 0 . 86 and 0 . 84 , and for the final clinical diagnosis 0 . 90 , 0 . 94 , 0 . 85 , 0 . 96 , and 0 . 93 , respectively .    3.562163980113766
the score yielded a rate of negative UNK and laparotomies of 14 . 3 and 12 . 3 % .    3.408501931193668
with respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute UNK , the score demonstrated a superior performance , with only 6 cases missed ( 0 . 9 % ) .    3.927060503653132
however , the number of patients with acute appendicitis , including those with perforated disease , who were not identified by the score , was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis ( 245 vs 63 ) .    3.484670862650489
with regard to the main procedural performance parameter , the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator ( p < 0 . 05 , 2 test ) .    3.062391923420416
the results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available .    3.2025386332066903
it may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines .    3.3773326811401665
purpose : the standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of mri are compiled .    3.322284244842774
resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated .    3.4434922363981846
replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem .    3.4552593110092715
the microporous material expanded UNK ( eptfe ) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction .    3.2406140729696116
in so UNK eptfe prostheses were reinforced with ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene ( UNK ) rings and implanted into the neck muscle of UNK pigs .    3.127327018799496
one of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect .    2.871684791096261
results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy .    2.8866057946002064
the shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability .    3.4704460137600712
the reinforcement elements did not impair UNK or the ability to UNK .    3.354651692419756
in vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation .    2.814734206465253
the improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses UNK and the reproducible formation of UNK are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects .    3.7140318186065984
primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 ( hhv - 6 and hhv - 7 ) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection , usually without any ill effects ; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem UNK .    2.956976203547299
like other herpesviruses , hhv - 6 and hhv - 7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective ( e . g .    2.514633066208317
in transplant recipients , aids , tumour patients ) .    3.164874194624144
hhv - 6 can be reactivated under such conditions and cause a variety of clinical problems , such as exanthems along with interstitial pneumonia or hepatitis for example .    3.6038323520432054
in addition , the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and hodgkin ' s disease .    2.8955928638926007
while , hhv - 7 may be associated with similar disorders , more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses .    3.267439393364896
pulmonary artery catheterization ( pac ) is widely used for monitoring and optimization of hemodynamic therapy in critically ill patients .    2.8248979089879067
despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach .    3.6830697098358876
in contrast , it has been suggested that pac might increase mortality .    2.8529587691482168
available data do not allow the definitive omission of pac in medical intensive care , nor do they justify its widespread use .    3.1245224634834163
open questions on the influence of pac on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials .    3.840365415906146
beforehand , knowledge about pac has to be improved .    3.9474570940043177
as a consequence , pac should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means .    3.0389794582547482
it is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients .    2.593469693660209
a long - term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high - dose stimulation with UNK in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment .    4.224202423468499
the in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular UNK and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives .    3.264487728361247
both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level , but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine .    3.4231164425491447
the exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro - and microcirculation of the penis [ 6 ] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery .    3.3689722636264015
adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [ 5 ] are necessary to UNK conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra .    4.029720992273746
UNK description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship .    3.549011730187429
the arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction .    3.2888445997396194
the dual arterial and venous UNK of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment .    4.292451728532378
the purpose of this article is , to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery .    2.5690279237395495
in this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas , the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint , is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium - term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy .    3.338540776597058
the criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis .    3.2648242642737633
the stages on mri follow the morphology of the interface , i . e . , the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone , on t1 - and t2 - weighted images .    2.609882254373686
after 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on mri between the two different treatment groups .    3.6049252821090265
in fact , in the majority of cases ( > 60 % ) the mri result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out .    3.9312807167632178
arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a UNK in the sense of UNK on the mri ( 36 % to 30 % ) ; nevertheless , a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases ( 4 % ) .    4.716340949505055
in both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis , juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms .    3.16304126661622
unfortunately , there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients .    3.2415185458351936
most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral UNK , especially low - estrogen combination or progestin - only preparations , with the exception of those , who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications ( especially in cyanosis , pulmonary hypertension , eisenmenger reaction , rhythm disturbances ) , fluid retention ( especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure ) , arterial hypertension ( important in coarctation ) , infectious complications ( endocarditis ) or hyperlipidemia .    3.0756429948620942
oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events .    3.848399102461971
intrauterine devices are very effective , have no metabolic side effects and merely UNK a small risk of endocarditis .    3.4063545425538773
newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk .    3.137352412375285
UNK UNK implants ( e . g .    2.7024986229857912
UNK ) are used with good results in the united states for patients with contraindications to estrogen - containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in germany in the coming years .    3.6621195455341864
barrier methods can be used , but have a higher failure rate , which may be inacceptable in patients at risk ( e . g .    3.576039226137824
especially in eisenmenger ' s , permanent sterilisation should be advised .    2.7874419793998713
we studied the levels of d - dimer , thrombin - antithrombin iii complex ( tat ) , prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 ( ptf ) , and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time ( pt ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( ptt ) , thrombin time ( tt ) and platelet count , plasminogen activation ( pa ) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups .    2.951936769203981
tt and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder .    3.9753474162561937
pt , ptt , platelet count progressively pa , d - dimer , tat , and ptf normalised progressively after heparinisation .    2.574286612180539
d - dimer , tat , and ptf levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations , and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies .    3.1690564556959293
in patients with acute or chronic myocarditis , arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease .    2.9463845185157593
the potentially malignant UNK - and UNK are of particular significance in the differential diagnosis of sudden cardiac death in myocarditis .    4.142843523195115
factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes , parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes .    3.2686161978217623
on the one hand , inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential .    2.9000042308750493
fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers , late potentials and UNK as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction .    3.6608881278941503
furthermore , parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension , increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias .    3.0778896361499064
lastly , vascular factors can further increase the UNK of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro - and UNK perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia .    4.010661329069826
non - invasive UNK evaluation by 24 h holter ecg , measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for UNK risk stratification of the at - risk patient with myocarditis .    3.543661372604464
programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias .    3.5747233288522606
it should be emphasized that , at the present time , optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist .    3.067836529955118
in a selected patient population , immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias .    3.3480338982514883
nevertheless , in the interim , further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment , vt ablation and UNK implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias .    3.3865389004777744
right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology .    3.7686526686367383
material and methods : autografts ( 4 mm ) of the left common carotid artery in 20 wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery .    3.5405643565513834
results : the demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture .    3.3024506839527987
in the intima , the organisation and amount of collagen iv was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments .    3.234039056215504
the media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for UNK the continuity break .    3.266183753013325
the adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis , in which collagen iii and iv - positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion .    3.078216677299607
conclusions : our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery .    2.9855811110509447
the identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery .    3.0019820927882925
we treated UNK patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995 .    3.4423313143335483
UNK had invasive melanomas with less than 0 . 75 mm breslow thickness ; of these , 45 developed metastases .    3.5261639254877664
three had second primary tumors with greater thickness .    3.2714003707875214
one case showed metastasis from another tumor .    2.8287793021372543
in two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically .    2.957278073207278
the remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities : a greater proportion of late and of internal ( as contrasted to regional ) metastases .    2.8825004317187437
most of these primary tumors had a breslow thickness of more than 0 . 5 mm and were clark level iii or even iv .    3.08955775278305
male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over - represented .    3.921737815126406
in this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient ' s and analyst ' s perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased .    3.413825068583317
successful interpretation enables the patient to feel , enact and UNK animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue .    3.124521054232867
the concept of primary aggression developed in freud ' s UNK on death UNK is discussed in its clinical function of relief .    3.3222948132876127
the UNK concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship .    2.948025672520108
freud ' s and subsequently UNK ' s examination of the UNK of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical UNK to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against UNK ' s vulnerability in the face of mortality .    4.129751499829498
the concept of primary aggression is obviously of greater relevance than UNK / aggression models since the former does not view the patient as mere victim of his biography , but as a subject with the potential to enact his own destructiveness .    2.753441145292409
since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed UNK , interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain ; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the UNK .    2.911036580602904
sudden and UNK feelings of UNK towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient ' s irritation .    4.009865462876451
interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance ; interpretation in transference , however , is viewed as UNK .    3.1037334143930755
finally , those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed , which UNK the analyst to protect the setting .    3.3896633689178817
background : respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world .    2.9166994564341686
highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life .    3.9924585449484575
young infants , especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity , UNK dysplasia ( bpd ) , chronic lung disease ( cld ) , congenital heart disease , cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency , are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe rsv disease .    3.0441779718794484
specific therapeutic options for rsv are limited .    3.2926291813313022
in this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal - epidural technique in trauma patients .    3.421455764100893
background : in denmark , france , germany , great britain and italy , the UNK project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine , an institute for medical UNK and health services research , a publishing company and different industrial UNK in the UNK market .    3.3600902121893896
purpose : a prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial ct with the long - term follow - up mri in children with severe head injury .    3.5687203174580513
a differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis , patient information on avoidance of known dangers , and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected .    3.4315711802360065
if no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient ' s condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about , this is considered to be a treatment error , and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm .    3.9415457698784606
information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time , which generally means on the day before the operation .    3.0338125400540976
an exception is made to this rule for day surgery .    3.07748598248825
the patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind .    3.4611516426380313
such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions .    3.52780358775511
in the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [ and making decisions ] .    2.843585573805841
in the case of unconscious patients UNK depends on " presumable consent to the operation " .    2.9851965174241313
if a patient later UNK lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be UNK to refuse an operation , she must elaborate plausible UNK for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information .    2.7579948339037945
within the last few years the use of point - of - care analyzers increased .    3.945983173696278
these testing is primarily performed in the emergency room , intensive care units , and in the operating room using small portable analyzers .    4.064638859048513
the fact of being UNK and working with UNK or UNK batteries and UNK cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting .    3.3145294095440256
patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability , which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to UNK , blood and UNK losses .    3.4064038572995763
this leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained .    3.351623375214283
the case of a 57 year old patient is reported , who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum ck and UNK values of 821 and 84 u / l , respectively .    3.4891312214321983
the patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 w steps every 2 min starting with 50 w . the ergometry was interrupted at 125 w because of st segment depression of 0 . 28 mv in v6 .    3.048751829464466
systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm hg , combined with severe angina and shock .    3.6659926438328654
volume substitution and catecholamines did not UNK blood pressure .    3.0745532111819713
immediate m - mode and doppler echo revealed a " UNK " - shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency .    3.362398695678548
the transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium , diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture .    3.1161701412045493
despite of shock , mitral valve replacement was performed successfully .    3.091171409620439
to our knowledge , this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction .    2.2695343724081187
the flow directed balloon - tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by UNK and UNK 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms , in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units .    3.2402972630747247
the rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent .    3.5259775422333566
main symptoms are cough , hemoptysis , dyspnea and cardiac shock .    2.908252221191882
complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon - tipped catheters are not strictly followed : excessive catheter manipulation , advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the UNK balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided .    2.986384255812503
patients with pulmonary hypertension as well as elderly and anticoagulated patients are at greater risk .    3.9393319591162985
on 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998 , in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed .    3.3625446647685675
the diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining UNK base .    3.1467242686492427
after partial corporectomy and discectomy , a tricortical bone graft has been inserted .    2.8928301534577567
an additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system .    3.3551363479536884
the incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal UNK .    3.1785284565131673
controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by x - ray and ct - scan .    3.412154334020413
there was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection .    3.1005097496799037
splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures .    3.560698524155463
this is a report of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of stroke , combining a stroke unit and rehabilitation in one clinic .    3.2293317680918676
this series contains unselected patients from a narrow surrounding .    3.2729614014383266
mean age of UNK patients was 68 . 7 years ( median 70 years ) .    3.8375017614178417
25 % of patients had an initial barthel index of < 30 , 20 % presented with UNK ' s and UNK ' s .    4.253710916781632
9 % suffered from cerebral hemorrhage .    3.131668535419013
the UNK chain of care allowed a relative short length of stay in the acute care ( 9 . 4 days ) without prolonging the rehabilitation phase .    3.5260104237416603
the one month mortality was 6 . 7 % , one year mortality 18 . 3 % .    3.6840090561585384
discharge to a nursing home was necessary in 5 . 4 % .    3.7926439749489713
overall more than 90 % of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic .    4.04122943389941
combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous .    3.256541722369425
about 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually .    3.132217357162215
this is a routine procedure for the instrument staff .    3.04424680510755
practice has shown , however , that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments , implants , operating room staff , and surgical planning causes problems .    3.4423215729831376
as a result of this , a prophylactic search for sources of error began ( risk management ) .    2.7959748981721484
cooperation and communication among manufacturer , surgeon , and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks .    3.3809717898830898
the obligate intracellular bacterium chlamydia pneumoniae has been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis since viable pathogen has been recovered from plaques .    2.7188026136414054
UNK are epithelial pathogens UNK for causing persistent infection .    2.8470726828521036
atherosclerosis , however , is a chronic inflammatory disease involving mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall .    3.713216198052568
a bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the UNK mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously .    2.8958254462086446
the study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy .    3.843756230857071
besides medical and sociodemographic data , two personality factors - self - efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain .    3.3749869039578244
self - efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully UNK the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes .    3.0940627413626327
locus of control , in the extreme case , is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action , versus an external orientation , in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate .    3.114727430072561
we postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them .    3.34844466496594
at present there is neither an completely UNK biomaterial available , nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility .    2.7227181362379342
one reason is the individuality of the host , especially with regard to the inflammatory response .    3.513092156238197
inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto - oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation .    3.123035528205563
the present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen - UNK UNK prosthesis ( dacron ) in UNK / c mice on experimental days 1 , 18 , 38 , and 322 .    3.3222139280846124
serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target .    3.485984494529229
specific polymer antibodies , enhanced by repeated implantations , could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322 .    3.0330847549882507
these antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating .    3.362268699549354
the antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete UNK ' s adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1 .    3.704417574325205
results suggest that specific polymer antibodies , reflecting an inflammatory response , might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses .    3.34134560003944
twenty - nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the trauma center " bergmannsheil " , university of bochum , germany , between 1981 and 1994 .    3.2253226080787396
all patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma .    2.8932002018094565
there were 16 lateral condylar fractures , 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ( " UNK - type " ) fractures .    3.3369686009840818
twenty - eight closed injuries and 1 grade iiib open fracture were included .    3.026223160777869
eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton .    3.275320632165197
all fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission .    2.8537610383064926
postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight - bearing for 6 - 8 weeks , progressing to full weight - bearing .    3.1216622036725403
the mean follow - up was 68 months ( 18 - 120 ) .    3.036439329683181
the therapeutic outcome ( clinical result , radiographs ) was rated by the neer score .    2.8979771258681906
twenty - seven patients were available for follow - up examination .    3.3395585445068328
of these , 23 were rated as excellent .    2.992118559881796
3 achieved satisfactory results , and 1 had an unsatisfactory result .    3.80613289545093
all patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries .    2.9132122436595087
open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long - term results .    2.762795872891611
the therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton .    3.1840331924344447
the realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients , but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients .    3.373458977183334
the global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems ; stepwise UNK of these problems may help to maintain or restore an UNK high quality of life according to the who guidelines for palliative medicine .    3.478370580970397
in light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group , palliative psycho - oncology must offer patient - centered UNK care in which the psycho - oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians , nurses , religious workers , psychologists , UNK , physiotherapists , social workers , and especially family members .    3.1293871608124832
together , this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed .    3.262578884473295
UNK - chiari syndrome ( bcs ) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation .    3.0130771127199627
in 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy .    3.5218193226776324
one patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia ; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis .    2.992235990444519
the actuarial 5 - year survival rate is 87 . 5 % compared to 85 . 3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from september 1988 to december 1995 at our institution .    3.4978203260279175
anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin .    3.2077389125303695
three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis , one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation .    3.101235210959791
two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy .    3.1560846122264796
two patients had to be UNK , one for thrombosis of the hepatic artery and portal vein after discontinuation of dicoumarin due to gi bleeding and one for hepatic vein thrombosis after insufficient dicoumarin intake .    3.0857981739802374
terminal bcs represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation ; however , life - long , closely monitored anticoagulation is essential .    3.3156022775958487
postmenopausal estrogen - replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture .    2.9724201281876645
there is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non - optimal dietary intake of calcium .    3.23886717061955
discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later .    3.8650930422637333
it is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis , with a diagnosis based on who criteria .    3.6280659003876106
UNK , a selective estrogen receptor modulator , and UNK , a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic , UNK and UNK properties , may constitute alternatives to estrogen - replacement therapy .    3.7616704672188703
UNK maintains bone density in and reduces UNK fractures by some 50 % in women with prevalent osteoporosis .    3.434451709591769
artificial insemination from donor ( heterologous insemination ) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility .    3.3271815011525083
in this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors , the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized .    2.9524215175947104
although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy , most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not - identifiable information on biological and social characteristics .    2.924890387701884
semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population .    3.672309800280624
the decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples .    2.724822563956337
retrospectively , however , the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership .    3.9105114901967504
the most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children .    2.650324704618073
the course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural UNK .    3.467327663797278
they receive more love and care than " usual " children .    2.86774905217074
their rights concerning the insemination , however , are poorly considered .    3.5548290228014356
if we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights , non - disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems .    3.127314397073406
the extended field of view imaging procedure named " UNK " provides , for the first time , a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length .    3.240640365733302
this allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view , without having to assemble several pictures .    3.4751620580126437
furthermore , pathological find - UNK can be shown in full size in their UNK .    3.3930993290404277
this method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding , for instance a tumor , during therapy .    3.1625509768166213
heart rate variability ( hrv ) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial UNK .    3.2636496784765945
recently , analysis of hrv - particularly of the standard deviation of UNK intervals ( sdnn ) - from short term ecg recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour holter UNK .    2.954179209190071
the present study is the first to compare sdnn from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction .    3.0497644671230653
in 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital , sdnn from holter monitoring averaged 93 + / - 30 ms compared to 39 + / - 18 determined from short term recordings .    3.53905576563494
patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age , left ventricular ejection fraction , mean rr interval from holter recording ( UNK + / - 153 vs UNK + / - 132 ms ) , mean rr from short term recording ( UNK + / - 153 vs UNK + / - 163 ms ) , and sdnn from the holter recording ( 71 + / - 27 vs 97 + / - 29 ms ; p < 0 . 001 ) however , patients with and without clinical event could not be UNK by means of sdnn measured from short term ecg UNK ( 35 + / - 22 vs 41 + / - 19 ms ; p = UNK ) .    3.651368348725546
thus , sdnn measured from short term ecg recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction .    2.837912665630868
analysis of hrv should be performed using 24 hour holter monitoring , which provides more information and reflects circadian UNK in autonomic tone .    3.299033849642504
glomus tumors ( glomangiomata ) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells .    3.2323949196261252
multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant , which is usually located UNK .    3.5278177688280152
nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort .    3.0888296200473806
treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors .    4.078401794520679
sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and UNK therapy .    4.034967764439633
we report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors .    2.8870614220926982
conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass ( lvm ) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning .    3.098395452188476
three - dimensional ( 3d ) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of lvm .    2.9021308728279096
determination of functional residual capacity ( frc ) can be performed through washout methods , indicator gas dilution or UNK .    3.204211519465316
some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated .    3.620625273196189
however , most measurement UNK are bulky , UNK to use and their running costs are high .    3.1554228975870684
hence frc measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated patients such as the determination of " best peep " , the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation .    3.6567287655865237
up to now most efforts to improve and simplify frc measurement were made at the expense of accuracy .    2.7747138406278355
an ideal method ought to be accurate , easy to handle and cost - effective .    3.030788907315228
it should supply not only frc data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space .    2.786924844791878
these demands can be met using modern data acquisition software .    3.0737590337003757
the pros and cons of all methods available for frc measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients .    3.571236350436418
the measurement error can be lowered under 5 % by special corrections for flow and nitrogen signal ( delay and rise times , changes of gas viscosity ) .    2.814614696626995
for flow measurement a normal UNK can be used .    4.370907951191394
using a UNK computer for data acquisition the bed - side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care .    3.2402942957264704
it is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as alveolar mixing efficiency and lung clearance index .    2.8224015541269845
three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly : securing the material needs of those requiring care , creating appropriate care structures , and providing an effective counselling back - up to alleviate interface problems .    3.1352251953608765
UNK latter , process - oriented aids , have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade .    3.676777530556622
the aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into UNK care , to stop the UNK door syndrome , to ensure that older people can stay in their homes , to support family members acting as care providers , to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers .    3.1786031256150995
in the context of case managment , these diverse tasks are performed by three basic UNK functions : the UNK , UNK , and advocacy functions .    3.6048005244174988
each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting ( care management , community care , managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help ) .    3.0741540348299563
bullous pemphigoid ( bp ) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly ; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin .    3.9008677707807107
several clinical variants of bp have been described , and we now add our observations of two bp cases mimicking subacute prurigo .    2.967420521161354
both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic UNK papules for several months before presentation .    3.0474544008011217
histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis .    3.292140526097027
in the serum of both patients , indirect immunofluorescence on nacl - separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters .    3.282524174609903
UNK skin biopsies showed linear igg or c3 deposits in the basement membran zone .    3.035130606507285
UNK of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230 - kd protein , which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen .    2.96478387767779
these cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid .    3.9998205550852117
the distal metatarsal osteotomy according to magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation .    3.1482265642300455
the length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy .    3.197325836440812
if necessary , soft tissue release and / or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to UNK the UNK under the head of the first metatarsal .    4.522628443251769
a review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 % .    2.895495144001105
radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head .    2.9886484496196726
evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation , the results were less satisfying .    4.701242302787
the metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by 14 ° and the UNK angles by 7 ° on average .    3.6377598640503583
the sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure .    3.918701741042327
the present historical review is intended to show that virchow ' s UNK and the terminology created by him are still alive .    3.40116367363985
the report encompasses a short biography , including virchow ' s UNK activities .    3.025037029226571
it starts with early experimental publications , which laid to the foundation for his UNK , and with dermatological studies of his early period .    3.5174838978714407
this is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work , " UNK " .    2.735955309775768
finally , his historical studies , his latter small publications on topics in dermatology , his pupils and scientific UNK , and the social - political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed .    3.041859126979504
thus , a UNK picture is UNK of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways .    3.4711293776101946
starter ' s pistols are often UNK for self - defense , but can also be used for criminal activities ( e . g .    3.1907830299626028
assaults , etc . ) .    3.0480244213653256
when a starter ' s UNK is loaded with blank cartridges and is UNK , a powerful shooting noise results .    3.568151981225803
the level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma .    3.05813054723289
for legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise .    3.131791548802671
we examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions .    2.702090568924333
in all , 15 different models of starter ' s pistols of 8 different UNK were examined .    2.695546852110722
in addition to blank cartridges , 8 mm tear gas cartridges were also examined .    2.781834910483822
four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle : 0 ° ( shooting direction ) , 45 ° , 90 ° , and 180 ° ( towards the firer ) .    2.929413433217359
the distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm , 50 cm , 100 cm , and 200 cm .    3.096311736502176
at a distance of 1 m and in the 0 ° shooting direction the peak sound pressure levels of nearly all UNK tested exceeded 160 db .    3.2464622495446065
at a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 db .    2.8625019552712865
owing to their rare incidence , foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit , skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in the literature by means of case reports .    4.100639987805081
here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years .    3.579312235393838
in seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone , whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved .    3.1585095525237388
except for one case , the foreign material could be removed completely .    3.559461544303134
three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a UNK during the follow - up period , but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases .    3.61130248311661
before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident , however , we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits , preferably by means of photography .    3.7383020697359095
ct is the method of choice for UNK the foreign body , except for the depiction of wood particles .    3.565495518047404
here , sonography and mr should be performed .    3.0683904644404194
as the therapeutic approach , the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of UNK , neuro - and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory .    3.712116253755307
to avoid inflammation , the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions : post - operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided .    3.794563600747652
treatment is completed by high - dose antibiotics , using csf - soluble substances and , if necessary , anti - UNK .    3.239199411386962
rocuronium is a new UNK muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described .    3.906949660360467
the goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery .    2.619713919278189
these operations , which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to " share " the patient ' s airway , require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments .    3.220176723881045
in addition , the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed .    3.5340101604738243
patients and methods : in order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis ( lasik ) , we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes .    3.258070137574051
treatment of UNK atrial fibrillation ( af ) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects ( beta - blockers , calcium channel antagonists ) may depress ventricular contractility and / or decrease arterial blood pressure .    3.3452513929939833
we have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior ( svc ) and inferior vena cava ( ivc ) where parasympathetic nerves , which UNK the atrioventricular node , can be stimulated electrically .    3.1438964842432124
in 8 dogs , a 7 - f catheter with an expandable electrode UNK at its tip was non - UNK positioned in the svc and in the proximal ivc ( time for positioning : 3 - 5 minutes ) .    3.6264908186438007
high - frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation ( ps ) with 20 hz at an impulse duration of 0 . 1 ms was performed during pacing induced af .    3.115121985875316
results : with increasing stimulus strength , a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during ps in the svc and ivc ( p < 0 . 01 , anova ) .    2.728835460176346
the negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of ps and UNK immediately after termination of ps .    3.388116342357824
during ventricular pacing at a constant rate , no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during ps .    3.8686727633018245
ps in the ivc yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the svc .    3.747815616314073
conclusions : transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during af can easily be achieved in the svc and ivc in dogs .    2.877017893155696
this procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of ps in humans .    2.9769124392016297
if the results translate to patients , ps may be very beneficial in the treatment of af in patients with congestive heart failure .    3.338951745101117
a total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months ( 12 - 98 ) .    3.4140730152073875
according to the ao / asif classification , 66 % of the operated group were fractures of type a , 29 % of type b , and 5 % of type c . all patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with UNK fixation and , apart from six patients , with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting .    4.072756914333509
the conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of UNK with closed reduction , plaster cast , and rehabilitation program .    3.3583874360246435
all fractures in the conservative group were of type a .    3.883296665505316
charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy ( hmsn ) which is known as charcot - marie - tooth disease since UNK .    3.0821972129079844
this entity , which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups , predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly .    3.2326620177898056
the first symptom , often unnoticed by the patient for a long period , is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer - toe formation and mobile pes cavus .    3.505713861113301
UNK atrophy of the peroneal , extensor , tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus UNK with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot , secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment .    3.1509583457613344
permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive UNK ( stage 5 of hmsn ) .    3.61931647798961
the alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal UNK is UNK by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells .    4.039400843797134
the first description , based on six cases , was published in 1986 by UNK and UNK .    3.313996178575229
from their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type ii pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells .    3.170651085927981
we investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung UNK by means of antibodies against UNK b and c of human surfactant .    3.4920772614979887
both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar - like spaces were stained .    3.265331611757674
the septal connection tissue cells did not react .    2.9832929808598183
breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women , whereas it is rare in men .    3.9374126822008826
in our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1 .    3.166479741069147
the present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area .    3.1194651627943553
we should like to focus on the following observations :    3.741229163347369
patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and UNK .    3.2005283463642704
an overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder , called UNK syndrome .    3.660149768839383
it is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome x , with consecutive monosomy UNK . 3 .    3.7072124724632958
the rapid development of recombinant dna technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities , termed gene therapy .    3.2695156461943267
gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes , correct defective genes , or induce UNK activity in the tumor - bearing host .    3.396936973401272
currently , an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials .    3.440628824833786
despite substantial progress , a number of technical and logistical UNK must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient .    3.5738540693945597
since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly , simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use .    3.2693492285304133
this report reviews various gene therapy UNK and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation .    2.905018857183412
special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene - modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment .    2.671391549807948
using the ptb simulator , which UNK real signals from patients , we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the dinamap 1846 ( critikon ) and the hp m - 1008b ( hewlett packard ) .    2.5138315430224636
for this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial UNK , cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator .    2.931762835317536
the invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation .    3.291051908832186
the invasive system showed a cut - off frequency of 35 hz ; the UNK constant was 0 . 21 .    3.1400842223163714
with 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each .    3.1353319772974557
from a total of 49 bio - signals from patients the dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the hp m - 1008b 47 signals .    2.8702913537714507
the mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic , diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to - 2 . 50 mmhg , 3 . 35 mmhg ( p < 0 . 05 ) and 1 . 51 mmhg with the dinamap 1846 and to - 8 . 5 mmhg ( p < 0 . 001 ) , - 5 . 15 mmhg ( p < 0 . 001 ) and - 5 . 58 mmhg ( p < 0 . 001 ) for the hp m - 1008b .    3.0807594383619987
the 95 % confidence limit for the systolic , diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmhg , 30 mmhg and 35 mmhg for the dinamap 1846 and 50 mmhg , 38 mmhg and 35 mmhg for the hp m - 1008b .    2.602223459035222
the differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different UNK detection and elimination techniques .    3.325186456519571
the results of the performance tests we achieved with the ptb simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations .    3.273769933325974
the american association for the UNK of medical instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 + / - 8 mmhg .    3.933856564761455
none of the examined instruments lay within these limits .    3.015931894368752
due to the systematic and UNK errors , we think that the dinamap 1846 ( critikon ) and the hp m - 1008b ( hewlett packard ) do not achieve performance levels that are adequate for measuring critically ill patients .    2.3542607168420675
many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations .    2.7293484633023155
however , emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry .    3.1227635382928525
therefore , psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only UNK accepted or UNK treated by these services .    3.0653404556645207
our present contribution aims at improving this situation .    3.0744785439948803
it gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned , their symptomatology and psychopathology , and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations .    3.1732295138983653
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined : type i means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury , type ii is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion , typ iii stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma .    3.147597861493588
overlapping of different types occurs .    3.8103401201391325
type i : the incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2 , 5 % .    3.434467890328532
multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior .    4.323047162970764
with a UNK analysis the segments to be fused are determined .    3.521221166279979
typ ii : the leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to 50 % of the cases .    3.092209704228582
a ct scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended .    3.737415649808754
early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at .    3.0829391132752715
during the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated .    2.9359067313759586
abdominal injuries are to be found in 3 - 4 % of all spinal injuries .    4.6104062811409205
all organs could be affected .    3.3535631747334986
a typical UNK is the " seat - UNK syndrome " with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a UNK injury of the upper lumbar spine .    4.996777820145285
the main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially .    3.646964215174065
the prognosis of this combination is favorable .    2.9813772074512324
typ iii : in 17 - 18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed .    4.340852849971631
from these only one third need surgical care .    3.1634630731433857
from 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6 , 2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above .    3.894737382668234
surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase ( day - 1 - surgery ) .    4.09321474666388
additional injuries , potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach .    3.571517536589828
non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures .    3.3123062052040644
in the early phase of treatment on the c - spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco - lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied .    3.2676141116007886
experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome .    3.317130066655706
the question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation .    2.54980271864952
two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here .    2.7894065396864827
the first case report clearly shows the life - saving and injury - reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km / h .    2.9548296900399977
hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the UNK vein .    4.213910943127802
analysis of the presented cases shows that , besides the well - known benefits , there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of UNK .    3.841177833940841
these have not been described before .    3.3788908600287653
it is concluded that patients who were involved in traffic accidents with airbag deployment have to be hospitalized and followed up carefully over time , even though they are initially stable , as potentially fatal sequelae of UNK trauma can occur later .    3.179929659188887
a questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis ( as ) sufferers in germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the german as society ; UNK patients ( 54 % ) responded .    3.420666749163177
the age distribution of these patients roughly UNK with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the german population .    4.659109748195293
the group of patients more than 65 years old is , however , under - represented .    3.768843099632873
introduction : headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the UNK , followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem .    3.4970407223425752
the noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown .    2.946351730272132
a preparation was developed in the barbiturate - anesthetized rat , in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed .    3.2563266527247645
atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall , dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors .    3.611035433440118
there are probably several candidate genes , that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis .    3.1606109591151315
in recent years , a growing number of gene polymorphisms , associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction , has been identified .    3.537120342369783
these genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism , regulation of blood pressure and clotting .    3.145699170789279
in contrast to rare UNK diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms ( e . g .    2.86201159275647
familial hypercholesterolemia ) , genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent .    3.1780701747895406
due to their frequency , there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease .    3.1671050665521623
genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle , environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders .    2.902103082751199
UNK - nine patients with 50 complex acetabular fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation from august 1993 to february 1996 in a prospectively documented study .    2.998453414142996
the fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach ( maryland approach ) .    2.549117354654066
thirty - seven patients were polytraumatized with an iss of 20 pts .    2.9002660857735396
in 10 patients the iss was > 25 pts .    2.8736012447315855
good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment UNK k 2 mm could be achieved in 48 UNK ( 96 % ) .    2.9819892167249553
in 28 fractures ( 76 % ) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d ' aubigne and harris scores .    3.6387370476078003
radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures ( 57 % ) and satisfactory in 12 fractures ( UNK score ) .    3.7590927092931246
in 7 cases ( 14 % ) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically .    3.141048596332971
no wound infections , however , were observed .    4.369670602598418
further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in 4 cases ( 11 % ) , relevant heterotopic ossifications ( brooker iii / iv ) in 5 cases ( 14 % ) , and aseptic femoral head necrosis in 2 cases ( 5 % ) .    3.5987147590453223
in two cases a total hip replacement ( thr ) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed .    3.022340108065858
two more cases are scheduled for thr due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis .    2.7815485038023926
a good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach ( maryland ) in complex fractures of the acetabulum .    3.004550320120975
however , the approach related morbidity seems to be UNK .    3.218054530069084
in complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved .    3.0467549435352606
the discussion on the results of open spinal surgery , in particular , on complications as a result of open surgery , e . g . , the so - called post - UNK syndrome , has led to the development of less invasive methods , especially for treatment of lumbar disc UNK .    4.375989414443077
percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods , such as UNK , retroperitoneal spinal disc UNK or UNK .    4.045688814679557
since the 1970 s , various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy , automated percutaneous nucleotomy , intradiscal laser procedures and , in part , endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically .    3.2047046595988564
the clinical results vary from 30 % good / very good results to almost 100 % good / very good results , depending on the author and study .    2.9250833798509404
it is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted .    2.8663964596581937
the results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method , which often have large case numbers , but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design .    2.96083104653813
to UNK good results , percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria .    3.5064449731066776
at the present time it can be concluded that , in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods , percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases .    3.133965463841828
a 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus c ( hcv ) infection had a secondary polyclonal igg - igm cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course .    2.9679980416360245
UNK the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura ( ppp ) .    3.2110112315360877
histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis .    3.2591162389196873
food containing UNK UNK - UNK UNK of the ppp , as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing .    4.416197017043228
in most of the previously described cases of hcv and type iii cryoglobulinemia , the typical UNK finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis .    3.015285061330319
normal aging is associated with changes in body composition , UNK perception , renal function , and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance .    3.767501171029065
the presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired UNK systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms , morbidity , and mortality .    3.1462247403398655
these disorders , which include dehydration , UNK , UNK , urinary frequency , and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for UNK water and sodium balance .    3.296284908827041
although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring UNK pressure UNK with doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization , these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation .    3.1852261633769783
the purpose of this overview is to evaluate " established " diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease .    3.2829893154220713
solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in germany .    3.05599465929799
for compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven .    4.008757045619237
for differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non - organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration .    3.3993260731181403
the UNK between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable .    2.762450839809416
to evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed .    3.0916164990897186
in this context scientific criteria regarding UNK of the solvent , duration of exposure , individual aspects of non - occupational influences , time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation .    3.5209083998886697
possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as UNK , neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed .    3.1539696432018927
the prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped .    2.830107899363734
additionally , adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis .    3.0892261543204786
standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine .    3.4530846398876935
UNK UNK , osteochondrosis and UNK arthrosis are well depicted by such images .    3.1701105945150645
whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms .    3.7586815768938435
special projections ( anteroposterior oblique radiographs , lateral radiographs in flexion and extension ) may be the next step .    3.328573135403357
for many abnormalities , mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon , mr imaging has become the standard procedure , largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution .    3.3232381900587686
ct can be used instead of mr imaging if the latter method is not available , and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities .    3.914056530832655
scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for mr imaging or ct . UNK and myelo - ct can no longer be considered routine imaging methods .    3.6922811278043506
a number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context .    4.000288020666335
we report on three years of experience with a new method of a simultaneous endoscopically assisted anterior release in the prone position , combined with transpedicular posterior scoliosis correction and fixation .    3.011845985734765
in 60 cases this simultaneous approach yielded substantial advantages .    2.9206903990943407
true derotation of the UNK - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved .    4.630523543661257
in cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system .    3.2817779684134023
the intraoperatively UNK lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube .    3.0196745761982813
beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated .    3.2226611033549704
a prospective , randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses .    2.709975760968242
magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines .    3.036476782417853
however , the patient is exposed to static as well as to time - dependent magnetic fields and radio - frequency electromagnetic fields .    3.5564125375188387
in 1997 the UNK , the german radiological protection commission , passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics .    4.076167532062647
in this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given .    2.719460662078794
in the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed , as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields , the gradient fields and the radio - frequency fields .    3.046886398350209
additionally , advice is given for the protection of high - risk patients , personnel , and the general public , together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers .    3.9184662023436534
granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat .    4.177450573511241
cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin .    3.752733451871362
it should be considered as an alternative to dapsone .    3.9466318702089986
the results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of ao osteosynthesis in a group ( n = 32 ) of the injuried , were compared with b group ( n = 187 ) of injuried , treated definitely with external fixator .    3.688565891290654
there were statistical evaluations and x - ray observations of healing in both groups , as well as the appearances of the most frequent complications such as : UNK infection , osteitis , pseudoarthrosis and reoperation .    3.7410174734851593
statistically less significant appearance of complications in a group during 2th and 6th month ( p < 0 . 001 ) was observed .    3.274604759194663
healing observed by x - ray in 2th , 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups .    3.040979897282256
since 1993 , 30 patients with acute intraarticular distal radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance .    2.5424840940525066
in 12 patients ( 40 % ) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed .    3.6312583787968036
according to UNK we found grade i - tear in one patient , grade ii in three , grade iii in six and grade iv in two patients .    3.3803666504166063
the eight individuals with grade iii - and iv - lesions additionally revealed marked UNK intraoperatively .    3.217168372435093
therefore , operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and UNK arthrodesis .    2.8385061742681383
seven patients out of this group ( 87 . 5 % ) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively , on average .    3.763377624958213
clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability .    2.907118828987938
objective grip strength was measured using a jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist .    3.387491521877273
radiological evaluation consisted of the UNK and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation .    3.9795415220857495
data were evaluated by the jakim and cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by gartland and werley as modified by sarmiento et al .    2.1132723843513053
according to gartland , 100 % of our patients showed an excellent result ; these rates were 86 % using the jakim score and 60 % using the cooney scoring system .    3.0327962623015794
according to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result .    3.6010407504647755
open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard .    3.4185042710315248
but arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results .    3.2437204016479786
arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases .    3.4003664269569205
therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization .    3.05462227365058
this prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization .    3.656074958173621
in 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with doppler sonography was accepted by the medical council of the UNK as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death .    3.7443000880170505
a survey was undertaken to determine how frequently doppler sonography has been used since that time in UNK brain death .    3.2874620088547837
a total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological ( UNK ) and neurosurgical ( 128 ) departments in germany .    3.0717480640112145
in all , 226 questionnaires were returned .    2.7474371588839066
in 71 departments , doppler sonography has been used to UNK brain death , mostly combined with other methods .    3.467235017597795
the question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the UNK .    3.2293997908220358
the background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls .    3.3484629405517894
in order to indicate pitfalls , the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites .    2.850050707252171
in none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data .    4.162623565529999
doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in germany as an additional UNK test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period .    3.7060915720492114
we report on a 64 - year - old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency .    2.9769527514623135
autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase - negative staphylococci - induced left - sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve .    3.3191713301652515
infective endocarditis by coagulase - negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event .    3.4176598736706367
the macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed .    3.146713813759444
thrombolysis therapy in childhood and adolescence has brought about numerous case reports , but no controlled studies over dosage and duration of therapy have been published to date .    3.6897024887919856
UNK are suitable for low - pain outpatient surgery of otitis media with effusion ( UNK ) under topical anesthesia .    3.638886755441958
the myringotomy perforations should have a diameter greater than 2 mm to ventilate the middle ear for approximately 3 weeks .    2.9787330735934194
comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound UNK naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics .    2.953985766177373
the following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions : UNK radial UNK , greyish - blue reticular patterns , opaque UNK UNK UNK , brown / black UNK on a blue / greyish background , UNK at the periphery and blue - in - pink areas .    3.3043485099321193
nevertheless , specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown .    2.7261074972597807
therefore , diagnostic evaluation of malignancy is based mainly on microscopic assessment of combined details of morphology and colour of melanocytic tumours .    3.032906688484057
the present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables ( including anxiety , depression , locus of control , expectations of pain intensity and social support ) and postoperative pain , analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients .    3.1909803024812433
clinical experience of 11 patients with charge association is reviewed .    2.9450005555771006
the study comprised six girls and five boys .    2.951404322657172
all presented with congenital heart disease .    3.1611658460136804
eight had bilateral choanal atresia .    3.142750997910564
UNK affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children .    3.4926427636318516
nine patients suffered abnormal UNK or deafness .    3.1614793377626365
in addition to major abnormalities , further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients .    3.118425931512923
all children exhibited UNK UNK and swallowing problems often resulting in recurrent aspiration pneumonia .    3.186517949183058
three patients had cleft lip and palate .    2.6130359696942955
both UNK and high - UNK palate were present in two patients .    4.195001909530371
facial palsy was observed in six patients .    3.9227542987976936
optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate UNK .    3.37447033413195
the anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible .    2.953201225036834
in our experience , the UNK approach is far more satisfactory than the UNK .    3.648574073944561
it gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair .    3.1557809441110294
after the child has grown stronger , a long - term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training .    3.2028964635088166
UNK are especially those situations , when people have to make ethical decisions .    3.038540475795296
issues of medical ethics UNK up not only in hospital series , but often in UNK where this subject is hardly to be supposed : UNK , UNK , love stories and UNK UNK .    3.7820428702462556
UNK these conflicts means offering a solution , and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as UNK for the social relevance of UNK topics .    3.5273773663018027
but it is possible that ethical principles of good decision - making fall victims to the UNK of the UNK .    3.461820093807635
analysis of the UNK conflict is similar to a case discussion in UNK and represents a helpful adjunct to the UNK of analytical and communicative UNK .    4.259380719083726
several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy .    2.9576774041740426
proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon .    3.4577553296226577
important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment .    2.883209010958137
possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed .    3.5835867426258465
inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy , by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation , or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation .    2.9025636581828045
at present , the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time , e . g . by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps .    3.026353531166275
technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and high - resolution sonography ( us ) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases .    2.9070332666883663
for mri , improvements in surface coils , dedicated low - field systems ( 0 . 2 t ) , and software improvements ( shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques ) must be mentioned .    3.344834813477335
clinical evaluations have shown that mri and us are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease , diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis , making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases , investigating vascularization , and quantifying pannus formation .    3.2821251422264544
in order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of mri and us in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be UNK .    3.6958244678764087
in addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism ( UNK ; splenic and hepatic UNK ) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues , especially in the UNK system ( res ) .    3.209030757501437
this tissue storage is limited in time ( weeks to months ) , is influenced by the employed solution and other factors ( UNK ) and has usually no clinical importance ( no res blockade ) .    3.6948096020377075
we report here a case study of a patient with sepsis ( lung , liver and kidney failure ) who had an overload of the res with UNK while being treated with dextran ( molecular weight UNK and UNK daltons ) and hydroxyethyl starch ( mw UNK daltons , molar substitution 0 , 7 ) .    3.184527279020788
in the late seventies and early UNK the toxic shock syndrome ( tss ) became epidemic among young UNK women .    2.909122505623092
a strong correlation was found between tss and the rising popularity of UNK UNK .    3.1905681091854423
exotoxin - producing staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of tss in controlled clinical trials .    3.289765089177431
menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of tss are differentiated .    3.2989763688344276
the nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate .    3.8563734576077224
several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual tss is approximately 1 - 3 cases per 100 000 persons .    3.2880073370264307
the leading symptoms are fever , hypotension , mucous membrane hyperemia , diffuse rashes , UNK , vomiting and diarrhea .    3.4991611075219544
the severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction .    3.4580766101329727
the streptococcal tss ( UNK ) caused by group a streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal tss .    3.853912478342482
both staphylococcus aureus and streptococci produce the exotoxin tsst - 1 .    2.909361426719161
new methods allow the detection of tsst - 1 production .    3.171592424041689
however , due to the low incidence of tss , this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures .    3.7011459690830084
this report focusses on the emergence and spread of s . aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance .    2.9455325565220933
results from typing mrsa originating from different clinical sources in all germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the UNK gene to clonal groups of s . aureus which have been until now sensitive .    3.450338914550442
these newly emerging mrsa are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics .    3.4436100942612926
this results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated mrsa .    2.696412934015983
worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by s . aureus UNK UNK and not UNK .    3.9302427253722376
background : for cataract surgery in this country retro - and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method .    3.2131521843446995
it totally UNK eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain .    4.0435594470432425
especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications , but the potential risks can be severe .    3.829044709731355
in the past UNK anesthesia could not be used on patients with difficult cataract surgery due to the insufficient anesthetic effect .    3.6561432011177675
a modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery .    3.135383990909088
in patients with coronary artery disease , it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia .    3.2488202731002787
the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia .    2.640528644570641
the UNK of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated .    3.124973974467376
therefore , the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area .    3.207608001993965
we report the case of an 8 year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy ( with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies ) and clinical signs of rigid - spine - syndrome .    2.8559919481314924
during treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during rem - sleep , hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found .    2.8275582930190946
this complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features ( like pulmonary hypertension , daytime - sleepiness , growth failure or further UNK of the muscle disease ) .    3.619667117990277
diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown .    3.5303519328722532
aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall ( imh ) .    3.199351578563343
analysis of the literature revealed UNK cases of in vivo diagnosed imh reflecting 17 % of all dissections , whereas in UNK studies this condition is found in 4 - 13 % .    4.174226360523138
transesophageal echocardiography , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging and aortography ( to rule out dissection ) have been applied for diagnosing imh in 57 , 49 , 43 and 38 % of the cases , respectively .    3.2137418479377624
however , diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date .    3.480497460393219
in 34 % , imh involves the ascending aorta ( type a ) .    3.168111089390327
the average age of patients with imh ranges between 55 and 65 years ; 65 % are males .    3.333501950285942
in 12 % , imh was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm .    3.630444975450278
with 87 % , arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for imh irrespective of its location .    3.5125109001485932
as suggested by the term " mediastinal apoplexy " imh may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media .    3.141201136590524
with 97 % , the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection .    3.6408799375372385
in 18 % , imh progresses to dissection and in another 15 % to rupture .    3.540316041627796
in 25 % and 28 % , respectively , dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12 % and 9 % , respectively , in the descending thoracic aorta .    4.296250111238146
the 30 - day mortality of imh is 24 % ( 36 % with type a and 12 % with type b imh ; p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.1366097208401293
with surgical repair , mortality of type a imh is lowered to 18 % compared to 60 % with medical treatment ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    3.310172393830501
in contrast , with 8 % mortality associated with medical treatment , prognosis of type b imh is more favorable without surgical intervention , the latter associated with a 30 - day mortality of 33 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.1211191490826957
thus , imh is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type a imh and with medical treatment in type b imh .    3.823751560523044
we report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic , and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele .    4.2404172570711145
our case reports are in accordance to previous publications ; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable x - ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult .    3.199906773588568
fractures often occur without pain or trauma .    3.2296657797171875
background : since the end of the UNK , accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries .    3.700442591750279
in contrast to traffic - related accidents in older children and adolescents , which were consequently registered and documented , no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in germany .    3.3994605862861533
this report presents data on accident - related UNK in a cohort of UNK infants , who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in germany from 1991 to 1994 .    3.6408274954401447
one - hundred - thirty patients underwent 53 electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and 96 atrial overdrive UNK on an outpatient basis .    2.772457984646131
the indications for electrophysiological study were disabling UNK , syncope , or UNK , intracardiac conduction disturbance , and UNK .    3.2451063297919993
in one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study .    3.6237721520823656
atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia .    4.2361906168263435
on the basis of the result of electrophysiological testing , 25 patients were believed not to require any treatment , 16 patients received new drug therapy , 7 patients underwent catheter ablation in a second session , 2 patients had either a pacemaker or an icd implanted , and 1 patient continued to receive the drug therapy that had been tested .    3.417172391520075
atrial overdrive stimulation resulted in a regular sinus rhythm in 66 patients ( 69 % ) .    3.0739963700055903
except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated , atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients .    3.8181277559489306
after the procedure , patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation , and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed .    3.58078336399388
severe complications were not observed .    2.9996729540318934
in 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae .    2.774415726958731
- outpatients electrophysiological study as well as atrial overdrive stimulation are feasible and safe in a selected group of patients .    3.8124209957914528
endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects .    3.8240100877834506
a retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long - term results .    3.1051231200014606
a total of 128 implants were inserted , 110 implants in the periorbital , 12 implants in the mastoid , and six implants in the paranasal region ; 113 implants were short craniofacial brånemark implants , and 15 implants were dental implants .    3.005207594205899
the success rate for implant survival was 94 . 5 % .    3.35526043080075
the term " ecstasy " includes a group of different UNK which produce hallucinogenic activity , stimulation and the so - called ' entactogenic ' effects .    3.2779358173999293
UNK have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences .    3.33731392466797
the " entactogenic " effect is the most typical of the UNK effects n 3 , 4 - UNK ( mdma ) .    4.358134418552937
mdma induces euphoria and acts stimulating , but the most common effect of mdma is a heightened sense of " UNK " with other people .    3.7928909495760363
ecstasy is not a novel substance .    4.4696228080648845
however , the rapid spread connected with the arising UNK - scene and the increasing prevalence of ecstasy - use world - wide is UNK .    3.0278013927249163
cisatracurium - one of the ten UNK of atracurium - is an intermediate long - acting non - depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent .    3.2158581787761467
cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients .    3.620675140777409
after approval by our institutional review board , 62 patients ( asa i - ii ) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xed95 or 5xed95 of cisatracurium or 3xed90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus .    2.110389100808854
after oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental ( 4 - 12 mg / kg ) and maintained with o2 / n2o and isoflurane ( 1 . 5 % - 2 % ) .    2.292045616208158
six minutes after administration of thiopental , patients received the muscle relaxant .    3.3718425757579547
six minutes later 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated .    2.637622985277835
heart rate ( hr ) and blood pressure ( bp ) were monitored every minute .    2.046411830913669
changes of heart rate or blood pressure > 20 % compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant .    3.6195331602829333
after application of the study drug , median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable .    3.8716882214643684
for each muscle relaxant , there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes .    3.6714463206149173
after 3xed95 cisatracurium , 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes > 20 % ( 2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia ) , while in the high - dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was UNK to be statistically but not clinically significant .    3.626714659093891
in the vecuronium group , 2 of 20 patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and 1 patient had statistically significant tachycardia .    3.393831602706558
the frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose - dependent .    3.284891134031988
after the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses ( 3xed95 and 5xed95 ) or vecuronium ( 3xed90 ) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed .    3.060044829321005
both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients asa i - ii .    3.0978470284226485
with regard to its cardiovascular effects , cisatracurium UNK with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant .    3.092688808135181
between june 1993 and september 1995 , 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail .    3.2647781130137923
there were 8 type a fractures and 10 type c fractures ( ao classification ) .    2.823431507146673
the operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch .    2.6650815142179867
follow - up was available on all patients and averaged 18 . 3 months ( range 6 - 32 months ) .    3.782961810162903
all fractures healed with an average time to union of 12 . 4 weeks ( range 8 - 16 weeks ) .    3.8864797872630885
bone grafting was not necessary in any case .    3.15225370248263
sixteen patients achieved almost the same rom as they had had before the injury .    3.053143062053922
one patient developed a varus UNK and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma .    2.7879112486173767
there were no infections or nonunions .    2.814623450382088
the retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of UNK - and supracondylar femoral fractures .    3.9220001198833714
it has been clinically applied for years .    2.88507306668631
in an experimental study in rabbits , we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with aaa bone .    3.434655079151521
two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits .    3.350729294714133
a cell - excluding ptfe membrane was wrapped UNK around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum .    3.4053106312120955
the posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane .    3.0113820249006458
thus , two compartments were created selectively , preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants .    3.058862568481989
for each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative ct ( UNK ) scans .    3.669041321691784
implantation of aaa bone led to new bone formation in both compartments .    3.31381868728907
contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost UNK increase in bone volume .    3.572267315243635
although bone formation showed interindividual variations , the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the student ' s t - test for paired samples ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.773047240371198
the data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized .    3.0093468309028037
in osseous augmentations with aaa bone , the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant .    3.476903295850726
shielding from the periosteum , e . g . , by cell - excluding membranes , leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of aaa bone and should therefore be avoided .    3.1431392227304538
computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in europe .    3.2568012444424674
reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern ct scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes .    2.999637873012818
the lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low - dose ct owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma .    3.2832978325481617
undernutrition , particularly protein undernutrition , contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture , by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength .    3.336511961208215
furthermore , the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency .    3.775239923977256
the igf - i system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications .    3.605475085759282
in the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin d supplies , protein supplements increasing the UNK from low to normal , raises igf - i levels , improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture , and UNK the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture .    3.4053742867524353
this nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital .    3.874626097159859
this underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures .    3.167696861402917
the article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised .    3.713291095794417
the chances for a UNK of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the UNK of public law .    3.828928550582728
with the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects .    2.658978022305822
simultaneously it gains normative significance .    3.2860517454551523
this is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions , and further in the context of the discussion concerning the UNK of local social policy for the elderly .    3.810468053292284
precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the UNK may be UNK from their responsibility to form , preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly .    3.257620775560567
a comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens ( p53 , pcna , ki67 ) , dna flow - cytometry and UNK of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers .    2.9331655648555524
clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority ( t3 , 43 % ; t4 , 18 % ) .    3.436937156319509
a 5 - grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei .    3.752164113369538
positive staining was obtained in 70 % for p53 , 57 % for ki67 and 80 % for pcna .    3.2164037913601016
sixty - two percent of the cases were dna - diploid and 38 % dna - aneuploid .    3.6695544398970497
the dna - diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei , preservation of wide margins of nuclear UNK , UNK of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei .    3.795030453329135
in the aneuploid - UNK cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism , with large UNK nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope .    2.825843884846746
a frequent finding was UNK of chromatin .    3.34661624741736
dense chromatin appeared in the form of small UNK spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei .    3.499788818214359
enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found .    3.162528241625684
the antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds .    3.093066544231064
during the last decades , this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2 - UNK acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation .    3.7995238302795658
some of them ( e . g .    2.168643115599993
ibuprofen , ketoprofen and naproxen ) have been given over - the - counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses .    3.525908818306371
nevertheless , pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions .    3.219794355930685
a 38 - year - old man presented with an intracranial extra - axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma .    3.0198070809621576
meningeal melanocytoma is a rare , benign melanotic tumour of the UNK occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults .    4.004380212270237
it usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate , necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies .    2.764864527487759
its immunohistological profile with s - 100 protein - , vimentin - and hmb - 45 - positive tumour cells is similar to that of ( primary or metastatic ) malignant melanoma .    3.0764257274626075
this differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications .    4.1133357281622045
therefore , UNK dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare , but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma .    2.861630410251796
a 54 - year old , obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face , especially of the upper and lower eyelids .    3.60064685736962
initially the swelling occured intermittently , but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields .    2.9145658206794733
neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac , renal or endocrinological disease .    2.916357269124258
there was no suggestion of a storage disease .    2.8270313588258293
skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation , so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a UNK UNK - UNK syndrome .    3.7831827121945154
eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields .    3.8411468437951166
treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated .    3.0086647096746915
regular follow - up visits over 7 months revealed no evidence of recurrence .    3.5407302017039832
the patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later .    3.0777707862230175
the relatives refused an autopsy .    3.284171843554834
the definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities .    3.4026715307635382
an 81 - year - old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train - of - four ratios of 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 , respectively , after two successive anaesthesia procedures ( enflurane - n2o / o2 ; vecuronium - succinylcholine - sequence ) for transurethral prostate resection .    3.3192858877448588
although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first , 65 - min period of anaesthesia ( 1 . 5 mg vecuronium for precurarization , 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation , 3 mg vecuronium ) , repetitive and UNK staggered administration of neostigmine after the second , 30 - min period of anaesthesia ( 1 mg vecuronium for precurarization , 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation ) had hardly any effect , so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4 . 5 h . laboratory analysis revealed homozygous , atypical , plasma cholinesterase ( UNK u / l ; UNK number 23 ; genotype e < ! [ cdata [ | lefbop | a < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | opnbop | 1 < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | e < ! [ cdata [ | lefbop | a < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | opnbop | 1 < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | ) .    2.295599755335933
this retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine - induced phase ii block in both instances , as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure .    2.9505388980383844
the degree of block transformation , and thus the available time , are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here .    3.314990462136411
it must be assumed that a complete phase ii block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia ; the purely competitive component ( train - of - four ratio 0 . 1 ) was easily antagonized by neostigmine .    3.2576764228097006
at the time of the attempted antagonism after the second , shorter period of anaesthesia , however , block transformation was still incomplete ( train - of - four ratio 0 . 5 ) .    3.237167795804949
the administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block , so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation .    2.946559472888696
the UNK - negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases ( cmpd ) are described , and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given .    3.1759144674747324
these are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2 , 331 patients with cmpds among a total of 34 , 160 patients referred between 1 january 1989 and 30 june 1994 to the bone marrow registry .    3.468168557136126
histological progress in each group is characterized by ( 1 ) increasing number and UNK of megakaryocytes , ( 2 ) increasing fibrosis , and ( 3 ) excess of UNK .    4.3230753436825715
these three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy .    3.5159675916064423
therefore , it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively .    2.7078136446740695
a staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced .    3.5961961589906437
its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic UNK - UNK .    3.8787776169556585
chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone UNK of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus .    4.558797589534514
for diagnosis , operative management and follow up , magnetic resonance imaging was useful , which can be further improved by application of intravenous or UNK contrast enhancement ( gadolinium ) .    3.776246828251966
in adults operative therapy is favored .    3.230851147262578
due to new techniques , arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy .    3.191168565609554
according to the stage of the disease , drilling or curettage , removal or fixation of the fragment , autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed .    3.199791802850041
all procedures can be managed arthroscopically .    3.885040957244696
general psychotherapy UNK ' t a new type of therapy , but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically - oriented psychotherapists .    3.787120876859227
the contents of this model are defined .    3.660680592247775
arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods .    2.8976586551736316
the procedure rules should be UNK together by a theoretical conception of psychological functioning , from which their relative significance and prescription conditions can be derived .    3.076551023815744
a consistency - theory based model of psychological functioning is UNK , from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other .    3.257808699203168
the advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed .    3.7257750803381864
in the federal republic of germany , no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms .    3.095887412067527
all randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage iii and iv disease .    3.637894605915777
in our opinion , this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials ( maximum 18 % ) .    3.15384794490523
to date , such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been UNK in resectable t2 - t3 , n0 - n2 disease .    2.7395338499078647
therefore , we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages .    3.1237774653593253
patients ( pts ) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin / 5 - fu prior to surgery and radiotherapy ( arm a , 70 pts ) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy ( arm b , 74 pts ) .    3.0950036896483875
patients were classified according to primary tumour site and neck disease .    2.961169271904164
the observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer ( cr : 43 % , pr : 37 % , UNK : 15 % , pd : 5 % ) .    3.343877235267633
after a follow - up of 12 - 96 months overall survival was 58 % in arm a and 45 % in arm b ( n . s . ) .    2.961177423795304
disease - free survival in arm a ( 61 % ) is statistically significantly better than in arm b ( 43 % , p = 0 . 03 ) .    3.4439953458256003
minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery ( UNK ) bypass surgery to the lad .    3.7466142639939095
this novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery .    2.898800815180735
applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis , this approach is gaining widespread acceptance .    3.342556849534209
a steadily growing number of patients with proximal lad lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates , now approaching 98 % short term patency .    3.588173340825782
in a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized ; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem .    3.056363002315807
our experience and the treatment results ( debridement , drainage and external fixation ) are presented .    3.365174501503057
the methodology , complications and final results are also given for 15 patients .    3.211900738278515
consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as UNK or internal fixation conversion methods .    3.8878389678951306
the time to consolidation without complications was 28 . 6 weeks ( 24 - 36 ) and with complications ( deep infections , chronic osteomyelitis ) 40 . 8 weeks ( 28 - 68 ) .    3.504564524254734
in total , there was one poor result with angulation , shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent UNK .    3.3376769676568925
the average follow - up was 22 . 7 months ( 1 - 34 months ) .    3.419868236016988
our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation .    3.6091930218273713
under war conditions , primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results .    2.8496248972620037
minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly .    3.3295885222878585
introduction of the computed tomography index ctdi and the multiple scan average dose ( msad ) has led to standardization of the dose description in ct examinations .    3.12329647002625
despite the use of these dose parameters , many different dosages are reported in the literature for different ct methods .    3.449834151691891
in addition , there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional ct , helical ct , and hrct used in chest examinations .    3.0362675145649125
the variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose , i . e . beam geometry , beam quality , scanner geometry ( " generation " ) , and operating parameters .    3.349482046543074
in addition , ct dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages .    2.718339416439647
recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and ct dosimetry and using similar operating parameters , show similar results in ct dosimetry for conventional and helical ct . on the other hand , dosages for hrct were greatly reduced .    2.8056195630134337
this was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing .    2.9385736942016667
central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients .    3.3972520609734183
in most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli .    3.2780813329759035
despite the introduction of UNK drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients .    3.5458225030980097
estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too .    3.5646229517344215
in UNK symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated , mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature .    3.8721701293047497
after introduction of the heart - and lung - machine in the surgical concept of therapy , survival rates have increased significantly .    3.728966044588244
we report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after cpr .    2.6791556721213654
in a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed .    3.758944505682608
imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making .    3.737914824907868
first of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial .    3.24257304132135
later on , accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention .    3.338132525304197
if histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed , different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor .    3.465121046089867
finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or UNK intervention .    3.502743233164233
a rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear - cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case .    2.9160136844280404
thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas .    3.5679213694550977
in spite of the importance of skin diseases in africa south of the UNK , dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems .    3.3968842078974983
aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses .    2.963398228160584
magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow , the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes .    3.293958751136312
however , the interpretation of mri in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult .    4.069889469426967
the aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age - and sex - dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients .    2.83529702617993
we report a case of a 26 - year - old patient , a UNK by profession , with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture .    3.2444674374179887
the emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient ( glasgow coma scale 3 points ) with no UNK blood pressure .    2.9098923989194168
after two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen .    3.1561033024126974
with a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the UNK cardiothoracic surgical unit .    3.548761597453221
during transfer , the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated .    3.4425802855787193
on arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro - femoral cannulation was supported by a heart - lung - machine circulation .    3.129937152370222
through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated .    3.349702363242418
the heart was effectively UNK and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of .    3.379216656291234
the patient could be discharged from hospital on the UNK postoperative day in absolute good health .    3.212130253617233
since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary , there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families .    3.4316980809184363
the specific features of mitochondrial genetics , however , hamper UNK definition of recurrence risks as in mendelian diseases .    3.2185318976985395
empirical risks were recently provided for melas and UNK syndromes and for leber hereditary optic neuropathy .    3.0177605072639944
in melas and UNK , higher levels of mutant mtdna in the mothers ' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring .    3.6549952388273255
as UNK syndrome is found with maternal , autosomal recessive or x chromosomal transmission , the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling .    3.3627827029053172
prenatal diagnosis was reported only in one case of mitochondrial disease so far , and in our opinion it remains questionable because of the uncertain correlation of the proportion of mutant dna in chorionic UNK and in clinically relevant tissues such as brain .    4.092579052471584
an accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by UNK grünewald in his UNK " the UNK of st . UNK " , which is part of the UNK UNK piece ( UNK - UNK ) , which is now exhibited in UNK , UNK .    4.1710977672987335
in contrast , sutton in UNK only described a " UNK UNK UNK " , leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark .    4.064023694784254
the term sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative UNK designation " grünewald naevus " .    2.7685653437595765
in women with breast cancer , staging of the tumor plays an important role and often is considered to be the most prognostic and therapeutic factor .    4.039257451923564
the most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic tnm classification .    3.219547527539686
tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response .    3.7183527246694257
thus , more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary .    2.9641207599199006
this article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities ( mammography , ultrasonography , magnetic resonance imaging , and nuclear medicine ) used for breast cancer staging .    3.048786628277979
furthermore , results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging .    3.4730579418736025
the lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot .    3.152791708088191
the equinus ( a contracture of the triceps surae muscle ) , the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones .    3.5840804905818375
the present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient .    2.7127247146253635
therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the UNK and the foot position .    4.086372689090796
casting and the application of UNK UNK are described having a major side effect of muscle UNK .    4.669523237172278
a combination of the different procedures , surgical interventions included , need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem .    3.51125483410417
still ' s disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms .    3.5349156170272122
in rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult - onset still ' s disease .    3.0335077923735243
the diagnostic criteria include typical rash , UNK , UNK of fever , and leukocytosis , as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly , liver dysfunctions , non - infectious angina , and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies .    3.512645899365884
we report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis .    2.787014211349094
the rash is a finding with high sensitivity .    3.5493997027669564
it is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is UNK .    2.738943884095888
during an acute flare of the rash , gentle friction induces erythematous , isomorphic ( koebner ) phenomena , which , as we describe here for the first time , may persist longer than the remainder of the UNK rash .    3.2645253035059127
objective : patients in a surgical intensive care unit ( icu ) have a high incidence of nosocomial infections which often lead to septic shock and death .    3.5111598383542417
since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult , it was recommended to obtain routine nose / throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient .    3.7701591941999326
methods : in UNK patients of our cardio - surgical icu , routine nose / throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro - organisms and resistance to antibiotics .    2.8720027865315707
of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation , and additional blood cultures were obtained .    3.0344664332836104
antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose / throat swabs , or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative .    3.1493482481298396
results : of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation , 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes .    2.85550885772841
of these 29 patients , 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose / throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab .    3.421658719469401
however , in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes .    3.161288174947754
while positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response , routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity .    3.4437576610089375
conclusions : routine nose / throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22 % of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation .    2.897053059420152
in addition , in almost 40 % of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical .    3.3994438276211434
as a result , we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier , specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients .    2.6626648333483747
the influence of defensivity , measured by validity scales of personality inventories ( mmpi - k , fpi - r , giessen - test ) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client - centered therapy .    2.49369390112087
in general , psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity .    2.7923772822449062
25 % of patients , who denied psychopathology at admission , did so at discharge and to some extent at follow - up , demonstrating an " especially good outcome " ( means ) .    2.9806298773856073
relative improvement ( effect sizes ) , however , was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales .    3.2262510828751414
- results are discussed with regard to prior hypotheses about the influence of defensivity .    3.946202723484664
in our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t ( tropt - rapid assay , diagnostic cut - off 0 , 2 ng / ml and UNK - rapid assay , diagnostic cut - off 0 , 1 ng / ml ) in 75 chest pain patients .    2.620803950573644
additional to the emergency ecg ( 3 - lead ) we acquired a 12 - lead ecg .    3.600902073338265
the tropt - rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11 % ( specifity 94 , 3 % ) .    2.6609673562734795
the tropt sensitive - rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62 % ( specifity 100 % ) .    2.6547639243172925
despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication , technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures , conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities .    3.7428096470724
because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities , a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible .    3.2468585964145116
conventional x - rays , completed by special projections like the ala and obturator view , and a ct scan allow determination of the fracture type ( the letournel / judet classification or the ao classification ) .    3.273750481720447
the most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient , i . e . , age , general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment .    3.0211392343261485
determination of the intact part of the weight - bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure .    3.554969398872509
the larger the intact roof arc , the better the prognosis .    3.10031559220129
together with the x - ray controls following axial and facultative lateral UNK , the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed .    4.123965554030604
early active motion of the injured limb , followed by walking exercises with partial weight - bearing , are important aspects of nonoperative treatment .    3.536309357426836
conservative treatment is recommended in non - displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement , transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction .    3.547615241459661
our clinical and radiological follow - up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981 - 1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively ( approx .    3.3922222502765833
we feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non - competitive therapeutic methods .    3.111284289068316
the choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type , the individual circumstances of the patient , and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities .    3.5317807118216784
conservative treatment can lead to excellent long - term results .    3.3528522359039448
problem there is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain ( clbp ) patients .    3.8854978040205554
chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons .    3.3115784884684576
methods our study group consisted of 90 disabled clbp patients ( 44 female , 46 male ; average age 42 years ) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8 - week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support ( instruction , endurance training , strength exercises , behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy ) .    3.052900517319017
initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons ( 44 female , 63 male , average age 41 years ) .    2.880722768286423
the patients were investigated before and after treatment , and at intervals of 6 and 12 months .    3.9352688080019314
the reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison .    3.370068051589548
physical assessment included a medical examination ( mainly diagnosis of radicular or UNK pain ) , changes in the lumbar spine revealed by x - ray studies according to UNK and turner [ 50 ] , rating of physical impairment according to UNK [ 117 ] , flexibility , length of hamstrings muscles ( slr ) , test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the swiss group of spring [ 102 ] and isokinetic measurements ( lido back ) , tests of lifting capacity ( lido lift ) , and ( in part ) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer ( case 15 UNK ) .    3.2431854736615
results physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced slr ( shortened hamstrings ) and decreased spinal mobility .    3.2860390063285965
patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals .    3.5376984888301775
the results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group , whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group .    3.414102984318428
in principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines .    3.577693522243235
cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients .    3.390514798582648
at the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly .    3.0954338818775016
in many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group .    3.0932351396385624
with time , however , training effects gradually decreased .    3.8627697471780573
the success of treatment ( return to work , absence from work , pain reduction , use of medical care ) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment .    3.9939265311701933
the only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance , in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group .    3.3627516946924034
however , even clbp - patients with long - term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program .    3.127599315550765
because of loss of condition during the time after treatment , regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary .    3.484849838451348
overall , treatment of clbp has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results .    3.0124826627674675
the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency - dependent .    3.217000521571192
to date , this has still not been fully investigated or understood .    2.7569922017578774
there remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution .    3.5104020024015115
the presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser - doppler UNK at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens .    2.950797643789233
motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical UNK .    3.0708807119040804
using a sound stimulus , the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured , and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by fourier transform .    3.0098216199684007
in the current investigations these models were refined and allow for the detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain , facilitating the optimal design of passive and active middle - ear implants .    2.8781261443298747
problem : postoperative nausea and vomiting remains an important problem .    3.079488559907287
many risk factors have been identified ; however , the importance of postoperative analgesic technique and patient expectation remain poorly defined .    3.8590595519407795
reactive oxygen species ( ros ) are probably not only unintended , toxic side - products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells , they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing , regulation of cellular proliferation and growth , and regulation of vascular tone .    2.864964770819415
ros are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms , including a vascular type of a UNK ( p ) h oxidase .    3.9567175925655906
ros formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress , environmental factors , the peptide angiotensin ii , cytokines , native low - density lipoproteins ( ldl ) , and in the presence of UNK metal ions .    3.5057616240381266
their ability to UNK ldl , react with endothelial - derived nitric oxide subsequently forming UNK , and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis .    3.2945162827694587
in animal studies , antioxidant therapy ( UNK , UNK UNK , n ' , n ' - UNK , vitamin e , UNK UNK ) have been successfully used to prevent fatty UNK formation , and to restore impaired nitric oxide - dependent UNK .    4.167505394482491
in man , antioxidant therapy ( e . g . , supplementation with vitamin e ) clearly increased the resistance of ldl to oxidative modification .    2.885680008656503
in one secondary prevention trial ( randomized , blinded , placebo - controlled ) , vitamin e supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non - fatal myocardial infarctions .    3.3314358914072213
before general recommendations can be made , results of further large - scale trials should be UNK .    3.523496826223851
a 36 - year old man suffered an isolated head injury with a fracture of the skull , epidural and subdural hematomas as well as brain contusion ( abbreviated injury scale ( ais ) : 5 points ) .    3.439144298045801
the hematomas were UNK by craniotomy .    3.692273342953707
because of high intracranial pressure ( icp ) a barbiturate coma was necessary .    2.815726035790434
additionally , the patient demonstrated acute lung injury ( ards ) due to pneumonia 8 days after trauma .    3.272530028275729
the patient recovered slowly and was transferred to UNK on day 57 after injury .    3.1543582780572237
during the following 12 months the patient developed a significant deficit of hip motion ( extension / flexion : right : 0 ° / 10 ° / 20 ° , left : 0 ° / 10 ° / 30 ° ; external / internal rotation : right and left : < 5 ° / 0 ° / < 5 ° ; abduction / adduction : right : 10 ° / 0 ° / 25 ° , left : 10 ° / 0 ° / 10 ° ) .    2.462882974883165
x - rays and ct - scanning revealed severe heterotopic ossification ( ho ) of both hips with UNK ( brooker type iv ) .    3.0643618421481853
the prophylaxis for recurrence of ho included preoperative single - dose radiation ( 8 gy ) and postoperative treatment with indomethacin ( 150 mg per day ) .    3.196552655982312
the patient revealed 15 ( left hip ) and 12 ( right hip ) months after surgery the following range of hip movement : extension / flexion : right : 5 ° / 0 ° / 90 ° , left : 5 ° / 0 ° / 100 ° ; external / internal rotation : right : 20 ° / 0 ° / 30 ° , left : 20 ° / 0 ° / 20 ° ; abduction / adduction : right : 30 ° / 0 ° / 40 ° , left : 30 ° / 0 ° / 40 ° .    2.4225834167572295
no recurrence of ho was observed in x - ray .    3.620660038941415
the patient is able to work in his profession as farmer .    3.6884139567687266
gastric teratomas are rare and mostly benign .    3.5532441243759822
they frequently become evident as a palpable abdominal mass .    2.865210469060223
a malignant , aggressive solid tumor must be excluded .    3.2024804671655587
we present a 6 - month - old male infant with a history of bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract .    3.51288332754224
after in UNK excision the histopathology was that of a benign gastric teratoma .    3.291603521331418
our method of reading the diagnosis and the subsequent therapy are described .    3.5177924131580065
the aim of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of patent foramen ovale - in contrast to risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources - in 208 patients with cerebral ischemic events .    2.944394760863627
all patients underwent neurological examination ( doppler , ct , nmr ) as well as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography .    3.2954260489040523
a patent foramen ovale was found in 75 patients ( 36 % ) .    3.283796090243855
with regard to risk factors for atherosclerosis patients with closed resp .    2.899904185821377
patent foramen ovale revealed significant differencies for age , hypertension , diabetes and use of oral contraceptives .    3.5868885252025398
cardioembolic sources showed significant differencies for atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm .    3.2864189083621933
multivariate analysis of risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources revealed hypertension and diabetes as age dependant risk factors in patients with closed foramen ovale .    2.957858537586544
in patients with patent foramen ovale the use of oral contraceptives was found as an independant risk factor for cerebral ischemic event .    3.1835517669570272
patients > 60 years with cerebral ischemic events had more often a closed foramen ovale .    2.981624681123181
in addition these patients revealed more often atrial fibrillation .    3.023079516709886
patients with patent foramen ovale had fewer risk factors for atherosclerosis or cardioembolic sources but presented more frequent the use of oral contraceptives or atrial septal aneurysm .    2.923041623487756
a retrospective study of 86 motorcycle accidents that occurred in the year 1992 is reported .    3.082660905179985
examination of the case histories supplemented by telephone UNK yielded the following results : 90 . 7 % of our patients were male and their average age was 28 . 8 years ; the age group between 25 and 30 years was the most frequently involved ( 27 . 9 % ) .    3.612300227826323
most motorcycle accidents happened during UNK UNK out in the UNK .    3.5526304900409067
special injury patterns were found for injuries of the upper and the lower extremity .    3.9473630939834026
lower extremity injuries ( 46 % ) , and especially open tibia fractures ( 19 . 7 % ) , were among the most common injuries sustained by UNK in crashes .    4.426079970488936
injuries of the upper extremity most frequently took the form of fracture of the distal radius ( 18 . 8 % ) .    3.309248972524683
in 23 . 4 % of cases the patients had to change their job after the accident .    4.194874613097196
more than half the crashes happened with UNK with between 500 and 750 cc stroke volume .    2.791125326284084
over a third ( 34 . 5 % ) of the patients had held their driving UNK for more than 8 years .    4.035990632471133
a UNK is made for more preventive measures , such as better driving instruction , better road conditions and UNK changes , against motorcycle crashes .    3.258618272275352
from the aspects of cost and the rate of complications it is reasonable to strive for a surgical treatment as soon as possible after the crash .    3.290711640094052
reflex sympathetic dystrophy ( rsd ) is a syndrome affecting an extremity after a minor trauma or operation .    3.4860785570826582
at the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of rsd .    4.063333013294044
in UNK paul sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of rsd may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity .    3.033267927150233
his theory found no UNK , as most physicians believe that rsd is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system .    3.3637636926199503
we performed various clinical and experimental investigations , including the effects of antiinflammatory treatment .    3.863419122794467
the results of these studies support the theory of paul sudeck .    2.7995558131335945
erectile failure after radical prostatectomy is a common postoperative disorder .    4.019830729824023
however , nerve - sparing technique provides in about 50 - 60 % erections sufficient for sexual intercourse .    3.105767123982613
damage to the cavernous nerves or vascular injuries are responsible for erectile dysfunction .    3.1967979189785587
alprostadil is most commonly used for self - injection monotherapy or in combination with other vasoactive drugs .    3.60182880686932
intraurethral administration of alprostadil failed to reproduce promising early results .    3.150123279739808
the oral drug sildenafil showed to be effective in patients with partial erections , however , it failed to work after non nerve - sparing radical prostatectomy .    3.8011749180730705
negative pressure devices and penile prosthesis can be considered as alternative UNK options .    3.763763863410684
autologous n . UNK transplantation during radical prostatectomy might further improve erection rates in the near future .    2.860239982111546
pregnancy causes substantial changes in the cardiovascular system : cardiac output ( 40 % - 50 % ) and blood volume ( 40 % ) increase whereas systemic peripheral resistance and arterial pressure decrease .    3.863436189329706
the rise in progesterone and estrogen levels accompanying pregnancy UNK the renin - angiotension - aldosterone system .    2.9537750839503008
increased prostaglandin production follows renin activation ; simultaneously , the arterial vessels show diminished angiotension sensitivity .    2.853411415388223
the result is pronounced vasodilatation .    2.800586627837375
heart disease remains the most important UNK cause of maternal death .    3.550269978834597
the physiological changes in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy influence cardiac diseases in different ways .    3.1738690978075383
pregnancy , labor , and delivery appear to be well tolerated in UNK with an atrial septal defect , ventricular septal defect , and UNK ductus arteriosus .    3.634458717600332
sometimes congestive heart failure occurs and appropriate medical therapy is necessary .    3.361777010839443
pregnant women with UNK cyanotic congenital heart disease ( eisenmenger ' s syndrome , UNK of UNK ) constitute a high - risk group because of right ventricular insufficiency and hypoxic attacks .    3.803836417193186
the consequences for anaesthesia in parturients with congenital heart disease are discussed .    3.073650923071462
the basis of treatment is the same as that of congestive heart failure , with the therapeutic spectrum ranging from diet to heart transplantation .    3.768615384973441
women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate pregnancy , labor , and delivery surprisingly well .    2.8337434192735573
vaginal delivery is possible , but epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated .    3.6470512649465494
hypertensive disorders associated with pregnancy are classified into three groups : chronic , treatment , and preeclamptic hypertension .    3.3317199261859813
whereas chronic and transient hypertension do not affect the outcome of pregnancy UNK , pre - eclampsia presents a potential danger to mother and fetus .    3.171354678727781
pre - eclamptic hypertension is accompanied by low cardiac output and plasma volume .    3.6053583143930585
an upregulation of angiotension receptors enhances vascular reactivity , with the consequence of high peripheral resistance .    3.2676052489205434
for antihypertensive therapy UNK , - UNK , and magnesium sulfate are the drugs of choice .    3.861180779255899
a generalised recommendation of anaesthesia for the pre - eclamptic UNK cannot be made because both general and epidural anaesthesia have risks of severe side effects .    3.1890271605648906
ct with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaws ( UNK ) is the method of choice for the radiographic assessment of the mandible and maxilla .    4.255512384037486
it is instrumental in UNK the relationship between bony lesions and the adjacent anatomy .    3.9049829939256533
using it , distinct characterization of pathology including infectious , metabolic , congenital and neoplastic lesions can be obtained .    3.075795584423188
the histopathology of bone marrow in primary myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) is described , with reference to the fab classification .    3.2254502259750693
variants such as hypoplastic , thrombocythemic and fibrotic mds are recognized from their histopathology and must be incorporated in the fab classification .    2.741139862970567
the clinical significance of hypoplastic , thrombocythemic and fibrotic variants is illustrated by the survival rates and leukemic transformation in these patients .    2.6765814260519325
histopathological classification according to the fab system corresponds with cytological classification , as proven by the distribution of the subtypes , blood values , leukemic transformation rates and survival times .    3.320142751175653
finally it is even possible to elaborate a prognostic score for survival based on histological features of diagnostic biopsies , which emphasizes the importance of histopathological examination of bone marrow in mds patients .    3.208305585091423
a 58 - year - old man developed an extensive pilomatrical carcinoma in the left axilla .    3.2004766781853973
clinically , a squamous cell carcinoma was suspected .    3.38938418119646
histological examination revealed the presence of proliferating basaloid cells with many atypical mitoses and mass necrosis infiltrating into the subcutaneous tissue .    2.9427033896240835
the tumor was removed by micrographic surgery with a 2 cm safety margin .    3.3587486291467292
histological examination of 2 regional lymph nodes as well as further diagnostic procedures ruled out metastases .    3.6225205545367087
we review the clinical and histopathological differences between UNK and pilomatrical carcinoma , as well as the published cases of the malignant variant .    3.9750079635816973
introduction : recent studies evaluating lay people and health care professionals about their process - quality checking the carotid pulse demonstrated poor diagnostic accuracy and more time needed than suggested in international guidelines for cpr .    2.749862806532957
so far there was no scientifically UNK data about the quality of checking the breathing .    3.798788261826042
study objective was the evaluation of the effectiveness of checking the breathing in an emergency situation with four different groups : lay people ( l ) , emt / paramedics ( e ) , medical students ( m ) , physicians ( p ) .    3.3394910760425147
taking into account the increase in worldwide human migration , leprosy is of growing importance in the differential diagnosis of dermatological diseases encountered in central europe .    2.9314429876160197
we report on the case of a young man from UNK who developed UNK UNK and plaques on his trunk and proximal limbs .    2.9993102164064034
the diagnosis of UNK leprosy could be made in consideration of the histological pattern of infiltrating leucocytes and detection of numerous acid - fast mycobacteria on skin biopsy .    3.0144950463487823
the results of the physical examination as well as routine laboratory and immunological parameters were consistent with this form of leprosy .    3.520184348266367
due to glucose - 6 - phosphate - dehydrogenase deficiency , treatment with dapsone was contraindicated .    3.067682364543507
with high - dose rifampicin and clofazimine therapy , the skin changes cleared over the course of 11 months following a leprosy reaction type ii ( erythema UNK UNK ) that developed during a phase of discontinued therapy due to low patient compliance .    3.7452623180906643
in the last few years two placebo controlled studies ( european cooperative acute stroke study and national institute of neurological disorders and stroke study ) analyzed the effect of systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) in acute hemispheric stroke .    2.831510240656537
both studies showed a positive UNK effect for the rt - pa treated patients .    3.3799589879710052
the number of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was higher in the rt - pa treated groups .    3.260473485041942
the results determine possible clinical or neuroradiological predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with rt - pa therapy .    2.89391468725179
the role of enteroviral myocardial infection in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy could only be substantiated after the introduction of molecular biological techniques ( polymerase chain reaction , in - situ hybridization ) in virological diagnostics of dilated cardiomyopathy .    3.6877384801841457
by using histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of myocardial inflammation in patients with the tentative clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy , a differentiation between inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of the who classification 1995 ( 31 ) was made .    3.537403017246687
inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis in association with cardiac dysfunction and is diagnosed by established histological and especially immunohistological techniques .    3.233429138280455
the combination of histological , immunohistological , and UNK techniques enabled a subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral myocardial rna in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy .    4.071101592673705
the intended - dynamic group therapy , until the unity almost unknown in west - germany , represented the most important form of therapy in the former gdr .    3.3219772281778877
its development , its conception of the relevant relationship between group - dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its UNK of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed .    3.2010765507614427
this raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the UNK about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts .    3.8269844905571895
even if we take into account that in the gdr there were very reduced possibilities to UNK psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts , in our view the intended - dynamic group therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy .    3.1265929956692555
it represents a specific therapeutical development of the former gdr which is strongly oriented at social UNK .    3.3161383284646755
it is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group , that means , at the manifest , conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy .    3.251615275222201
the authors view this form of therapy as a " historical compromise " in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former gdr and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses .    3.4582446224740058
in a prospective study of central fractures of the talus , radiological data ( plain radiography , ct , mri ) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings ( biopsy taken at time of screw removal ) .    3.320795760873409
the study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years .    2.9788168361045857
there was one fracture of hawkins type i , one fracture of type ii , four fractures of type iii , and three corpus fractures .    3.6169269910823947
all were operated on within 24 h after injury ; seven had screw fixation , two had adaptation with k wires .    3.0464016408597616
the patients were kept non - weight - bearing for 14 - 53 weeks .    2.852766528517851
duration of follow - up was 2 years or more in all but one patient .    3.74630524653368
in the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients , while four showed a partial avascular collapse ; in one patient , a partial collapse was doubtful .    3.3202383113520995
histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed UNK - free original bone in all cases , with deposition of new bone varying in extent .    3.351191561807145
hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients , positive in one , and negative in one .    3.6777781106746272
decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by ct than by plain radiography .    4.134214100135477
mri appeared normal in five patients , partially pathological in two , and abnormal in one .    3.454959621794349
a positive hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs .    3.1196722476895946
however , in the case of a central talus fracture , even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred .    3.478167033894796
vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically .    4.353587947980535
purpose : to assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants .    2.8772047135949417
methods : a saturation inversion projection sequence allows the selective imaging of strongly t 1 weighted signal from the mr contrast agent .    2.70457393099669
a coronal UNK leads to images comparable to conventional urography which can be acquired as a sequence with four images per minute .    3.3049407578766843
fmru revealed in 6 patients normal findings , in 6 moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis without any urodynamic relevant obstruction .    3.6552853456766186
3 pathologic findings , ureteral leak , ureteropelvic - junction obstruction and ureteral stenosis were diagnosed and consequently surgically treated .    2.929580687279795
the imaging quality in all studies was diagnostic and UNK relevant .    3.63885274277516
conclusion : fmru can be used as a noninvasive technique for the assessment of renal transplant in cases with suspicion of complication in the excretory system .    3.577235316529176
the infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication , which is hard to eradicate .    3.639746900453617
the results of reaming the intramedullary canal after removal of the infected nail were evaluated in our investigation .    3.4172196642260255
from 1984 to 1991 fifty - five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial .    3.352373707191259
twenty - one patients had an infection of the femur .    3.271038053768264
thirty - four patients had a primary infection of the nail , twenty - one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing .    3.2778375279103487
all patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation .    3.0458093402768984
at the time of the follow - up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection , range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort .    3.509748979691131
the mean time of observation was 10 , 1 + / - 4 , 9 years .    3.2856398347346523
all patients with initially infected intramedullary nails had no recurrence of the infection , compared to 62 % of those with multiple operations prior to nailing .    3.2652182297047667
at the time of the follow up all fractures had healed .    2.9755094595219296
85 % of the patients performed full weight bearing .    3.664846719379183
32 patients ( 91 % ) had good or excellent rom of the adjacent joints .    3.529148186368266
the discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists .    3.7268219129845908
conservative treatment , augmented repair , and reconstruction with autografts are discussed .    2.9432609576726168
from 1993 to 1997 , 49 patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair UNK ligament augmentation of 3 mm .    3.352157333894718
there were 21 isolated and 28 combined ruptures .    2.8416476216264077
in 5 cases bony avulsions were UNK by screw or additional hook plate .    2.913067496798347
osseous avulsion had good results in all cases .    3.727385635011157
isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in 7 of 15 cases and instability of 2 + in 8 cases .    3.4366891436465923
the medial range lysholm score was 76 . 8 ( + / - 21 . 6 ) , the oak score showed 2 very good and 5 good results , 3 fair and 5 bad results .    3.8563757159838605
using the ikdc score led to 3 very good and 4 good results , 2 fair and 6 bad results .    3.1716179714011954
using subjective criteria , 10 patients described results as very good or good , 2 fair and 3 bad .    3.3399178077576037
we think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft .    3.8936181703314134
through cooperation between the german contact dermatitis research group ( UNK ) and the information network of departments of dermatology ( ivdk ) , results of standardized patch tests performed by the participating centres are UNK recorded in germany .    3.201618023768054
for this study , data from 24 departments of dermatology ( UNK patients ) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996 .    3.6133439775028275
with decreasing frequency , nickel , fragrance mix , balsam of peru , and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often ; UNK high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with UNK l - 101 and UNK .    2.7796266077243743
differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995 , referring to subgroups of patients ( defined by gender , age , localization of eczema , geographical region , occupation , sensitization ) and particular problems .    2.8387016747339975
in men , percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel , fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women .    2.7214286434276853
younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations .    2.877045865370708
a comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations .    2.895118935470558
the spectrum of allergens found in UNK was similar to that of the whole test population .    3.6779399925444625
patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population .    2.988675714149858
sex - and age - adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996 .    3.415161179337359
the clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent .    2.9850675969452705
differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve the quality of diagnostic and prophylactic procedures in allergic contact dermatitis .    3.2463457891630214
intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin ( bt ) induce a localized , long - lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the bt dose administered and that is free of major side effects .    3.38033720095591
with this profile , bt can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle UNK .    3.4167321464882496
these disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation .    3.198264796472619
they are difficult to treat with conventional methods , can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system .    2.9767497141652908
in the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of bt in rehabilitative neurology .    3.0347701704464995
regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome , five main indication groups are identified : ( 1 ) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles ; ( 2 ) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles ; ( 3 ) improvement of patient care ; ( 4 ) avoidance of sequelae in joints , tendons , ligaments , and teeth ; ( 5 ) various special indications .    3.365505890686458
myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours .    3.478912419823622
in patients with sleep - related breathing disorders ( srbd ) , it is assumed that apnea - associated changes of hemodynamics , blood gases , and UNK lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep .    3.784672378570945
this investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without srbd .    3.9900756132549575
currently no serological marker for the monitoring of uveal melanoma and its metastases is available .    3.2863897318331468
the novel UNK antigen melanoma inhibitory activity ( mia ) is expressed in the uveal melanoma and it ' s metastatic lesions .    2.7835327781720953
persistent atrial fibrillation ( af ) is associated with shortened action potential duration ( apd ) and reduced atrial refractoriness .    3.130689253205524
remodeling of ion currents responsible for ap morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent af .    3.1221065870842013
in the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac l - type ca2 + channel and the mrna transcription of the cardiac l - type ca2 + channel subunits in patients with persistent af compared to patients in sinus rhythm ( sr ) .    2.865860490541149
right atrial appendages of 10 patients in sr and of 5 patients with af were used for UNK UNK to record l - type ca2 + currents ( ica , l ) by the patch - clamp technique .    2.997044658824258
right atrial appendages of 16 patients in sr and of 5 patients with af served as sources for determining the mrna expression of the l - type ca2 + channel 1c - , 2 / - , a - , and b / c - subunits by semiquantitative rt - pcr .    2.645038368149344
cell sizes , expressed as cell UNK , were identical in both groups .    3.1898776499216197
mrna expressions of the 1c - subunit and the b / c - subunits were reduced in af patients by 18 . 9 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) and 77 . 7 % ( p < 0 . 005 ) , respectively , while mrna UNK of the 2 / - and the a - subunits were not significantly different between sr and af patients .    3.59912057525411
a decrease in the availability of functional l - type ca2 + channels in af patients , due to reduced 1c - subunit and substantial lack of b / c - subunit transcription seems to contribute to the shortening pf apd and refractory periods in af , thereby UNK increased atrial excitation rate and perpetuation of af .    2.8467900898693617
34 patients aged 3 months to UNK underwent transcatheter - occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils ( cook ) .    3.084802562254264
eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a UNK - occluder ; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition .    3.6845749722053585
only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm ; all had systolic - diastolic murmurs .    3.360442044205112
all other patients had ductus - diameters below 3 mm ; three of them had systolic - diastolic murmurs , 17 had systolic murmurs , and 8 patients had no murmur at all .    2.826665019272666
the ductus was closed in 24 patients using artrial access only , in 6 patients via a venous , and in 4 patients both via venous and arterial catheterization .    3.7078681070400656
one coil was used in 23 patients , 2 coils in 9 , and 3 coils in 2 patients .    3.950905428715271
there were no complications of the intervention .    2.8123984701885463
within 24 hours 31 patients ( 93 % ) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients ( 94 % ) after 6 months .    3.460554921834119
coil - embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick , safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation .    3.2466722476398977
the volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few , selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures .    2.913792878481438
it seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs .    3.357378945405893
the purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient .    4.224615941712227
as shown by a number of studies , preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance .    3.392797706650695
abnormal laboratory results in otherwise healthy patients rarely alter the anaesthetic management of the patient and are not related to perioperative complications .    3.76344348713644
extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care UNK .    2.9596016864909287
a more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable UNK .    2.927704258476888
to achieve UNK UNK an efficient organisation of UNK assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on - day - of - surgery - UNK .    3.4296857251782122
there is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing .    2.8879827232747126
the anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary .    3.941975574392793
according to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease .    3.6080275558363595
careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated .    3.172330592000905
the UNK odontogenic cyst ( boc ) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst .    3.3427829123530532
the origin of the boc can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue .    3.3444982411109025
the boc is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible , as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years .    4.3479213657363385
most of the 11 published articles of boc have shown high rates of recurrence .    2.9257072733535523
histopathologically the boc is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin , UNK epithelium .    2.973356623359174
clusters of glycogen - rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular UNK of the cyst lining .    4.017231849259501
one case of a large boc ( 65 - year - old male , boc UNK 33 - 45 , diameter 5 cm , radiographically and histologically multilocular ) is presented with a review of the literature , including the therapeutic management , and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed .    3.8333125055898725
the immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin ( ck ) 13 UNK the histogenetic origin of the boc from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands .    2.9460713085458616
the expression of ck 19 and the lack of expression of p53 , as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the boc , may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst .    3.8202631166859713
within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill , we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program .    3.1704890693584207
the course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3 - year period by means of annual follow - up examinations .    3.6793897415556738
the sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years ( sd + / - 8 , 5 ) .    3.310567998784398
the majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization .    3.7471687329293757
after 3 years , 22 % of the patients were integrated into the general labor market , 26 % had UNK employment , 23 % were still in work therapy , and 29 % were UNK .    3.715883374684532
besides the patients ' subjective expectations , early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration .    3.2013914029414083
outpatient work therapy is a contemporary , effective organizational form of UNK .    3.7579665392231365
it may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration , reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology .    3.088925403250875
this hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial .    3.2545383032765987
aim of study : goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in germany .    3.7554769262610725
ultrasound contrast agent is used in color doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels .    2.8924284989109945
we present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained .    3.8125605035174877
up until now , 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus , tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined .    3.404959287827952
conventional b - scan sonography was supplemented by non - contrast color doppler flow imaging .    3.181561604332676
depending on the indication , 2 . 5 g levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg / ml .    3.392962082553998
the administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the doppler signals .    4.074250142642949
about 15 to 30 s after injection , an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected .    3.0422023709882673
the UNK injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent .    3.7506087248317987
in 64 % of the lymph nodes , vessels could only be identified with the administration of levovist .    4.67443727875039
the general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83 % of the cases .    2.9749441196647353
the lymph - node - supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media .    3.836484919807198
additional information , which was gained in 17 patients , increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept .    4.0214850065919405
in three cases , the examinations with the signal enhancer resulted in a change in therapy .    3.6621674480603716
by applying signal enhancer in color doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded .    3.186635644303685
non - syndromic UNK recessive deafness ( UNK ) is one of the most common human sensory disorders .    3.616918001751426
mutations in the UNK 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non - syndromic deafness in different populations .    3.5045359253703174
laser - induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors .    3.404913988616575
the basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a UNK application system .    3.872061987720309
in an ex vivo test series , the specially developed application system ( UNK tip ) with UNK j had a higher UNK loading capacity than the UNK applicator with 4200 j , thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7 . 6 cm3 .    3.200087090402496
the results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four - phase connective - tissue organization within a 6 - month period .    3.0942285304550126
furthermore , the same laser energy ( 4200 j ) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2 . 5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series .    3.4924283858242173
the influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study .    3.1962056530009253
by temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion ( pringle ' s UNK ) during laser application , the effective volume could be increased to 50 . 3 cm3 ( p < 0 . 01 ) using an optical beam UNK .    3.133165456628973
these results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser - induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled .    2.9672828973691643
a total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction ( amplicor test ) for the direct detection of chlamydia trachomatis .    2.9090608675369873
the results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique .    2.8183401193501756
using cell culture a urogenital c . trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients .    3.303807036282265
the amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83 .    3.3482624257023366
referred to the detection rate of the amplicor test and that of the cell culture , sensitivity was 91 . 2 % for the test sensitivity and 79 . 1 % for the cell culture .    4.535486560267009
the specificity of both techniques was 100 % when the specimens for which neither both nor either one of the tests gave positive results were considered .    3.289374643951655
in accordance with other studies , this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will UNK cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of c . trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital UNK infections .    3.1377655788519627
incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear .    3.4483647074089285
npe is infrequently diagnosed , usually in association with head trauma .    3.637215423888249
pathophysiological mechanisms include a rise of the pulmonary vascular hydrostatic pressure either due to sympathetic innervation with pulmonary vasoconstriction or increased left - atrial pressure following systemic arterial hypertension or an increase in pulmonary capillary permeability .    3.316837760621292
in contrast to npe , cardiac complications are frequently observed , most consistently in patients with UNK hemorrhage .    3.540208650877061
typical ecg changes are repolarization abnormalities , similar to those observed in coronary heart disease , and cardiac arrhythmias .    3.5597153016482435
the ck - mb may be slightly elevated ; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left - ventricular function .    2.9765552565916567
pathological examination reveals UNK necrosis .    2.9766626689844236
cardiac complications are explained with overactivity of the sympathetic innervation and high levels of circulating catecholamines .    3.1774141453957605
for adequate treatment , close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions .    4.337977736887362
benign , non - parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or ct scan .    3.1385218606413443
we present the case of a 68 - year - old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the UNK duct .    2.9157116619099677
due to the location of the cyst in the UNK UNK with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma , operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm .    3.7849828167194746
this review summarizes briefly pathophysiology , clinical definitions , pathogenesis , risk factors , diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke .    3.3143427579792726
ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial - embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or UNK reduction of cerebral blood flow .    3.176701312971716
we focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration , the therapeutic time window , the role of UNK neurotransmitters , ca2 + - influx , free radicals , and the development of ischemic brain edema .    3.797133255082714
based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized .    2.9142459188455776
this includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure , ecg , oxygen and blood glucose concentration , and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply .    3.7333664881899873
since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis , the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination , laboratory baseline , vascular ultrasound , cranial ct - scan , ecg , and echocardiography is UNK .    3.5717536611981884
based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed .    2.5899377827306838
new data about the effectiveness of basic care , treatment of edema , neuroprotective agents , and thrombolysis is presented .    3.530760211465664
indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin , vitamin k - antagonists , antiplatelet drugs , and surgical procedures are summarized .    3.498777186020511
longitudinal UNK defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3 - year period by using the " vertical ( vram ) - and transverse rectus abdominis muscle " ( tram ) flap .    3.233894862578815
the majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer .    2.83716343503054
nine out of 12 pedicled vram or tram flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial UNK ( " UNK " ) .    2.915684028949498
therefore , operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable .    3.245438777661057
adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases .    3.858393834209085
two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition .    3.5910488754767895
the introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections .    2.755219686428629
lengthening and shortening is achieved by changing the length of the fixator telescope .    3.7146901258069573
axial corrections are performed by additive or UNK techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures .    3.1685516328078496
translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal " double angulation " .    3.84282794396852
derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the " ring part " of a hybrid frame .    3.665776205215357
unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the UNK nail .    3.7488797000411744
UNK in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae .    3.1676999173862614
background : morphological changes in the corneal surface after prk may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity , but also in changes of contrast sensitivity .    3.318530479132523
the aim of this study was to investigate whether prk has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars .    2.878761318738766
calcifying UNK atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56 - year - old patient .    3.055549473469104
remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta , as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification .    3.250807878772225
differential diagnostic considerations had to include calcifying tumor of the aorta , remnants after UNK or secondary calcified aortic dissection .    3.4148571329191038
the osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be UNK permanently or healed through an endonasal access .    3.158380617704841
the obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process .    3.6049970104077587
in these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice .    2.9399672424493666
we review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique .    3.413124357755347
indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall ( 3 ) , a UNK of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall ( 4 ) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall ( 1 ) .    3.7991154564261396
the frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision , the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue .    3.453061350824352
the anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants .    2.8344602473701035
the follow up period was 1 . 8 years ( 11 months to 8 years ) .    3.834801591541558
all patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ent - examination and radiological assessment by ct - scan or mri .    3.112362454114046
the overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent .    3.038165354245011
there were no serious complications nor any recurrence .    2.832849475410629
the cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration .    2.9376580869280473
UNK ataxia type 7 ( sca7 ) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar UNK ( UNK ) .    2.878544411225606
the clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration .    2.5591305284314827
other common signs are slow UNK , external ophthalmoplegia , and pyramidal tract signs .    2.9626147454795797
the disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable cag trinucleotide repeat in the gene for UNK 7 on chromosome 3 .    3.4932519788176806
sca7 is a rare disorder .    4.425449764699909
the first case in germany was described only recently .    3.3616668108156946
we report two additional patients , father and son , with the molecular genetic diagnosis of sca7 .    3.229516057436709
the father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 cag repeats , the son 51 .    2.8761435723956725
normal alleles range from 7 to 35 cag repeats .    3.1999115591609755
both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration .    2.764708767842054
we found a pronounced anticipation ( earlier disease onset in subsequent generations ) , which is highly characteristic of cag repeat disorders .    3.0571259566292994
in the following contribution the under - proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is UNK .    2.7542634016340237
regarding the changes concerning the UNK of vocational training to more job - integrated , self - directed and UNK learning the consequences for training opportunities , motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed .    3.268833965686305
tick - borne encephalitis ( tbe ) is the most severe UNK disease transmitted by ticks .    3.53741480522624
the mortality of the central european form is 0 . 7 - 2 % .    3.930898861204309
active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions .    3.506834730878023
we report on 4 patients with tbe UNK in middle - hessen between 1994 and 1997 ( 2 in 1997 ) .    2.952301256301357
after repeated csf and serum testing the tbe - specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases .    3.4249629828337484
in one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi .    3.2077976466015605
the results of the initial csf - analysis were atypical in 2 cases ( high cell count of 136 cells / mm3 , total protein up to 1 . 5 g / l ) .    3.296406136927902
the endemic region for tbe has expanded in northern direction into middle - hessen , a region in which lyme borreliosis is also endemic .    2.812079891678954
thus , true double infections are possible .    2.9370861562278034
this and the initially frequently atypical csf - findings make the differential diagnosis difficult .    3.2989646775795967
therefore , repetitive csf and blood examinations are recommended .    3.1291125664457016
nedocromil sodium and cromolyn sodium are non - steroidal , anti - inflammatory drugs for the treatment of asthma .    3.700875984344132
although they are chemically different , there are many similarities in their mechanism of action .    3.319458028844811
in provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests ( allergen , exercise ) , but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as UNK challenge .    3.2503306135395356
very few studies compared the two drugs .    3.335555848563381
in children , only one study was done , showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium .    3.289826476731019
thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil , the other being proven effect of steroid - sparing , which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium .    3.1182857074192674
both drugs are recommended as first - line agents in mild persistent asthma .    3.0505560118369264
background : we evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens - as illustrated by typical clinical pictures - on the frequency and prognostic values of UNK complications in herpes eyes .    3.170817794673086
the evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy - induced benign changes following surgery and / or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology ( cct / mri ) or function ( spect / pet ) .    3.2077714889427695
current literature and the present data of our own patients demonstrate the diagnostic efficiency of imt - spect and fdg - pet in the detection of recurrence and in - vivo grading .    3.074974739554546
thirty - nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow - up were studied by fdg - pet and imt - spect .    3.140778880498996
thirty - four of 39 patients showed recurrences ; in 12 cases even a change in the grade of malignancy was observed .    3.1853571420146363
all high - grade recurrences could be confirmed by either methods .    3.8943339908461594
imt - spect showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low - grade tumors at recurrence .    3.818970675160625
in contrast to imt - spect , fdg - pet supports sufficient in - vivo grading .    2.6941167334100293
both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and UNK .    3.702364132433881
in conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of imt - spect and fdg - pet in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade .    2.855514391761475
a 22 - year - old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ent clinic of berlin - UNK .    3.392227570465831
worldwide only about 150 cases are known .    3.6842772624535347
we describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision , bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy .    3.0204153458203793
a preoperative 99 tc - thyroid scan and mri study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor .    3.2669675739026
the therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy .    3.129757687019396
transforming growth factor - 1 ( tgf - 1 ) is a UNK growth factor in carcinogenesis and UNK multiple cell functions .    3.680423180475586
we wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of tgf - 1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer .    3.2222442233956867
the tgf - 1 blood level was analysed in 394 patients .    2.9223366721703954
in 242 patients ( group i ) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy .    3.362677914071438
the tgf - 1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer ( n = UNK ) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia ( n = 85 ; 14 258 pg / ml versus 14 UNK pg / ml , sd 10 516 pg / ml ) .    3.7978440861822844
in 152 patients the blood was taken 6 - 12 months after radical prostatectomy ( group ii ) .    3.3671324722345335
there was no significant difference between the patients with a psa - progress and without psa - progress after .    3.042978125638549
our results suggest that tgf - 1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia .    3.4539300290175237
the aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria .    3.0822887875813763
moreover , the patients ' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined .    3.7673630883931994
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies ( ins ) , food intolerance ( food ) , drug UNK ( dru ) and urticaria ( urt ) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments .    2.990933709197862
patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance .    3.029874659097226
patient education was the favourite technique for the patients ( food 78 % , urt 57 % , dru 24 % , ins 17 % ) , followed by relaxation treatment .    3.7558677949968806
the most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self - responsibility , a feeling of helplessness and social limitations .    2.9043856106317327
if strong indication criteria are applied , psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group .    3.490578142838139
in spite of that , the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support .    3.4029307795881953
the definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp .    3.2309896662112645
at present all non - physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors , are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature .    2.874262483238189
many UNK or UNK or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and UNK our surface water .    3.723820872766785
here they may cause severe UNK of UNK life .    4.34946486733474
only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water .    3.2564408580604174
on the other hand , weak estrogens present in plastic UNK may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health .    2.6028144238828532
on the other hand , many plants produce UNK ' UNK - estrogens ' , particularly UNK products are rich in phyto - estrogens but their high consumption in asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer .    2.796119811323113
many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto - estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of UNK complaints .    3.1065889331225143
hence , not all endocrine UNK must be harmful to human health , in fact , some of them ( clearly phyto - estrogens ) may have beneficial effects .    3.1461295330187373
germany ' s new protection against infection act ( UNK ) will take effect on january 1 , UNK .    3.7399907919649844
it will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections .    3.484334289886419
an increased demand for human resources at the non - medical staff level is anticipated .    3.2209938667465376
continuing education programs for medical and non - medical staff at public health offices are mandatory .    3.5588895662498254
physicians in private practice , hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information .    3.007766599215405
a timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications UNK by county health offices has to be performed at the state level . this is a UNK for immediate response in case of non - localized increases in reported disease incidence .    4.073245059454884
the author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme ( epidemiological fire brigade ) in which public health physicians at the county , state , and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand .    2.7678792365141587
we report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent UNK loss of blood and mucus , impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain .    2.9899084984913085
on endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only , whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically .    3.474731563727138
biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae .    3.1200173770481876
these clinical , UNK and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome .    3.37014480576997
only 26 paediatric cases ( age at diagnosis 6 - 9 years ) have been published so far .    3.8974101144395736
the interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis ( mean : 3 , 7 years , range : 1 week to 9 years ) is remarkably long in childhood cases .    3.561561599314627
pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed .    3.0568207432870134
there is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease .    2.8271293687303785
the ulcers UNK often resistant to different medical and surgical options .    3.3543583924438387
discussion : pediatricians should be aware of the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in order to make an earlier diagnosis and to prevent unnecessary diagnostic procedures and concerns of patients and their parents about more severe illnesses .    3.3045504321753314
a UNK of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed .    3.3366099812184813
in a comparative analysis of 29 studies , maximal androgen deprivation ( mad ) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation .    3.332553990817245
thus , mad cannot be regarded as the new gold standard .    3.170520186569961
most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - UNK special attention .    4.285937308584566
this aspect has not yet been evaluated , however , in the largest multicenter study , UNK study UNK .    4.0481645259394075
in patients with advanced bone metastasis or severe pain , mad treatment should be begun because of the flare phenomenon .    3.5458969452938724
the synergistic effects of lhrh agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated .    2.992998357980186
since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum - psa levels under mad does not delay progression , the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not mad should be begun .    3.217557851200623
a case of generalized maculopapular rash and local UNK plaques following s . c . injections of either low - molecular - weight heparin or conventional ( high - molecular - weight ) heparin to a 75 - year - old woman is reported .    2.8179813131746156
this rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed .    3.58454965753718
perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications .    3.203016950834969
therefore , perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events .    3.2845417079275765
in patients above the age of 40 years , the ecg is a basic investigation , often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases .    3.28409470797712
stress testing and , in special cases , stress echocardiography or scintigraphy ( the latter only in those patients , in which exercise is impossible ) can detect significant coronary artery disease .    3.294009804879422
the vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease .    3.4526926976441636
however , prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome , because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery .    3.480814524253783
other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography , chest UNK , routine scintigraphy , halter ecg or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment , although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases ( heart failure ; valve lesions , in particular aortic stenoses etc . )    3.069701829153918
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively ( e . g .    3.48233911690631
normalization of blood pressure ) .    4.383932270639974
a verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder ( UNK , UNK ) developed in a 66 - year - old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with UNK ' s ulcer for 10 years .    3.3818749424007755
up to now , only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder UNK with UNK cystitis have been reported .    3.0384451618818997
although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far , the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation .    3.804258463674852
after conservative management had failed , a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed .    2.8501878999113623
the characteristics of interstitial cystitis , verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed .    2.860094899406345
nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor - like abdominal masses .    4.086911416554626
methods : we report a case of a 49 - year - old patient with an intrauterine device .    3.2331866498656527
the patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen .    3.332614731682207
after sonography , computerized tomography , UNK and colonoscopy the preoperative UNK diagnosis was a carcinoma of the UNK colon invading the abdominal wall .    4.352641086934693
pathological examination after a right UNK surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis .    3.112215942458633
results : based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed .    3.405138435288676
conclusions : this case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass .    3.195566091906695
after a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy .    2.881104742615349
long - term treatment of patients with chronic UNK requires integration of many therapeutic approaches , co - operation of several professions , and regard for the views of patients and relatives .    3.47270053268919
psychological treatments , social resp .    3.2497724218009303
continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration .    3.719596969641286
indications for adding on antidepressants , lithium , carbamazepine , benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed , as well as treatment of negative symptoms , depression and management of treatment - resistant symptoms .    3.316675677162983
psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient .    3.650041137507727
in the context of a stable long - term relationship , the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action .    3.5537492231794126
effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited .    3.637051681009564
the best results are achieved by social skills training .    2.704596839970774
social therapy , which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient , is of paramount importance .    4.108101136291288
improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long - term social rehabilitation .    3.353792410564208
interventions based on the ee concept are highly effective , but are rarely used .    3.533263378682786
programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective .    2.968999921367111
the functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained , the integrative role of case - management is stressed .    3.4435225057694434
the effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension - type headache was examined in the design of a randomized , placebo - controlled double - blind crossover study for the first time .    2.8965409266844864
the preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo .    3.578165208326459
the liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol ( 90 % ) ad 100 ( test preparation UNK 170 , UNK pharma , berlin ) ; the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for UNK purposes .    2.8585947996700107
the reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen ; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance .    3.1246740103529334
the study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age , suffering from tension - type headache in accordance with the ihs classification .    3.1530361362617785
four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double - blind , randomized crossover design .    2.9516896281778213
each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 UNK of the oral medication ( 1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo ) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation ( peppermint oil or placebo solution ) .    4.226458279701201
the oil was spread largely across forehead and UNK which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes .    3.314814192082699
using a headache diary , the headache parameters were assessed after 15 , 30 , 45 and 60 minutes .    3.138848905194286
compared to the application of placebo , a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.767693559112767
this significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period .    3.678012624364933
acetaminophen , too , proved to be efficient compared to placebo ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    3.0128693570024834
there was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution .    2.210618258228263
simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold , however .    2.5831629913762475
the patients reported no adverse events .    3.0661579574218365
this controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently UNK tension - type headache .    2.7549268312152244
peppermint oil thus proves to be a well - tolerated and cost - effective alternative to usual therapies .    3.755046995015944
the positive results of several multi - center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years .    3.0313529524527794
it was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease .    3.021823137035044
to improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice , a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the german - speaking european countries .    3.735288726147473
the aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge , compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence .    3.2445670143591503
dislocated metacarpal v fractures , fixed by percutaneous kirschner wires or other implants near the UNK joint , often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings .    2.982543514660536
we therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to UNK .    2.961331056995071
twenty - five patients were operated on in a 3 - year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined .    3.4036266936767605
six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction .    3.192795947094538
one patient suffering from an early stage of sudeck ' s dystrophy was healed , and no other complications appeared .    3.3396448275066675
three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment .    3.407961499887956
we therefore recommend intramedullary kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal v fractures .    2.5909333938588515
aspiration of toxic substances , foreign material , UNK contaminated secretions , or water ( near - drowning ) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction , it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction , and pulmonary infection might develop .    2.8354765049206625
respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention .    3.1085597709028274
the knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation .    3.4817343482152285
mortality varies between 3 and 70 % depending on patients studied , and on the nature and amount of aspirated material .    3.6578573213156766
the major cause of death is acute respiratory failure .    3.163936226769262
the onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid .    3.3552435913861034
therefore , therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late .    2.990554052281786
more importantly , oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation .    3.114625367527465
antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop .    3.136182178507545
prognosis in near - drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation .    3.0510871972965896
a rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near - drowning victim .    3.1414677857612188
anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult .    3.620346647592343
one third of them survive with a moderate to severe neurologic damage .    2.9256695331989566
the overall mortality of near - drowning is about 11 % .    2.8214729199744353
pathophysiological aspects , diagnostic procedures , UNK management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed .    3.3120058907807657
background : semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the UNK UNK power of the cornea .    3.814370628484508
the purpose of this study was to UNK the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods .    2.825214798988505
recently , professional anaesthesiologists organizations , have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring .    2.9292318972091915
these recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia - related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality .    3.0387181520384248
however , no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized , controlled trials .    3.390373642966255
four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated .    3.5213114565250803
oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended , although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia - related deaths .    3.4763923425188263
pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended , but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique .    3.610857488700336
transcutaneous po2 is considered mainly for historical reasons .    3.3161193857812887
near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation .    3.5516922647949305
the increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions .    3.184557677156804
one of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis .    2.8151292649722763
despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies , the advantage for stents remained small ( about 10 % less restenosis ) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention .    3.240679443806438
there is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an " unrestricted strategy " .    2.9072524997460123
this concern was expressed in the acc expert consensus document which was published recently ( UNK 28 , no 3 , september 1996 : UNK - UNK .    3.0585533605351967
based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries .    3.4339742885873275
removal of the arterial sheath immediately after ptca is desirable for patients , reduces the medical staff ' s workload , and may decrease hospital costs due to a shortened length of stay .    3.772775925562004
while partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the vasoseal collagen prototype device has been previously reported , similar complications occurring with the angio - sealtm device were not published .    2.8230028294384417
in this report , we describe a 54 - year old female patient ( height : 150 cm , weight : 42 . 5 kg ) who was transferred for ptca following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction .    3.036291614886191
immediately after ptca , the angio - sealtm device was UNK utilizing standard technique .    2.7139401885710193
no difficulties were encountered during device deployment , however , immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred .    3.312475906622167
due to the UNK of hemostasis , heparin was reversed with UNK to avoid further hemorrhagic complications .    3.3507792249863755
following this , the desired hemostasis quickly occurred , but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery .    4.0004055530245255
unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery .    3.6766005519989986
the complete angio - sealtm system ( UNK including collagen ) was located UNK , and removed during surgery .    3.7408704335183214
deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological .    3.127052543779487
during growth , the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes .    3.506613884342603
the femoral neck - shaft - angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth .    3.0392412150186976
the lower leg is UNK in a varus direction at birth .    3.803220265690093
on the basis of an extensive literature search ( dimdi , medline - status at june 1992 ) , the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables .    3.0543850316323664
the contact urticariogens can be divided into ( 1 ) chemically defined substances and ( 2 ) chemically undefined biological materials .    3.644642927762951
the causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given .    3.074565028472308
numerous agents are known for medical professions ( physicians , nurses , dentists and dental technicians , UNK surgeons ) .    3.038838491609674
today , the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber ( gloves , condoms , tubes , UNK , etc . ) .    3.370901755115493
when testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons ( UNK test , prick test , scratch chamber test ) .    3.246618697605152
in the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic ( ige mediated ) or non - immunologic ( toxic or pseudoallergic ) .    3.128713197141727
when there is a high degree of sensitization ( e . g .    2.9404217937190813
to latex ) professional activities must be severely restricted , or even completely discontinued in rare cases .    2.858713308744531
purpose : to find and describe potential mri criteria of UNK vessel canals of carpal bones .    2.633467371077725
2 - agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive , analgesic and sedative properties .    3.4306245753252513
platelets bear 2 - receptors on the cell surface .    3.510242618068311
stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation .    3.543769207002075
the present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2 - agonists clonidine and UNK decreases 2 - receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation .    2.9992431697996
prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians .    3.518266042196073
acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain .    3.5210407171270233
the basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia , the clinical symptoms , the diagnostic tools and the UNK available therapeutic options .    4.657192848537849
time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30 - 60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours .    3.535372124350241
the present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of UNK diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or ptca .    3.5685991322426034
the aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism ( phpt ) is the UNK of UNK and UNK .    4.188139942225224
despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre - and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal - invasive surgery thereof , success cannot be guaranteed .    3.3175223006719796
therefore , we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage - free , atraumatic , anatomical - orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation .    2.682062230383036
success is based on the four UNK of the UNK surgery : history , embryology with anatomy , neck surgery and experience .    4.224363082201953
by means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in UNK patients with phpt from 1982 until 1998 , we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of phpt .    4.075776776952997
a 67 - year - old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome .    3.2903692401737232
biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary UNK - UNK on light and electron UNK - copy .    3.901211217960404
other non - UNK causes of a nephrotic syndrome ( e . g .    3.2174136957957917
amyloidosis , UNK glomerulopathy , light - chain glomerulopathy , UNK , collagen - iii glomerulopathy , fibronectin glomerulopathy ) could be excluded .    3.653102048885751
besides the case report , differential diagnosis of fibrillary UNK is presented .    3.692638564949594
two patients were infected with sporotrichosis ; one had the fixed cutaneous form , the other the UNK form .    3.319013098542044
sporotrichosis UNK was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy .    3.526773744149497
both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole , one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period .    3.0986048301346654
abstract mitoxantrone is an UNK UNK agent that has recently been shown to be effective in UNK disease activity in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) as indicated by clinical and mri data .    3.3089104361296204
however , the role of mitoxantrone in UNK treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear .    3.4692758479082384
in this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing - remitting ( 9 patients ) and secondary progressive ms with superimposed exacerbations ( 6 patients ) treated UNK with mitoxantrone in our clinical research group from july 1994 to october 1998 .    3.5235463192739376
eleven of these patients ( 73 % ) were treated with azathioprine , interferon - beta - 1b or cyclophosphamide before .    3.8483032263714607
the patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months ( 19 + / - 6 months ) with a single dose of 10 mg / m2 monthly for the first three months .    4.1632153983178855
thereafter , infusions were repeated every 3 months ( total dose UNK mg + / - 45 mg ) .    3.5181346032177627
the annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3 , 0 + / - 1 , 5 in the year before therapy to 0 , 5 + / - 0 , 5 during therapy .    3.8492212321633046
nine patients ( 60 % ) were stabilised , while four patients ( 27 % ) showed an improvement of disability .    4.174809142713392
the treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects .    2.6020526572068654
these results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in ms patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and / or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication .    3.203398900486832
interstitial cystitis ( ic ) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging .    3.1493900859678043
strict UNK criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes .    3.554715439484938
their routine application would miss large proportions of ic patients .    2.972290384277575
large voided volumes ( functional capacity > 250 cc ) or longer micturition intervals ( > 2 h . ) , absence of UNK or symptom - free periods reduce the likelihood of ic .    3.388420861646981
further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests ( infection ) , cytology ( in - situ carcinoma ) , ultrasound ( calculi , UNK , anomalies ) and UNK in selected cases .    3.6306981321423435
bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value , since functional low - volume bladders can be mechanically UNK .    2.984304951553558
UNK under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for ic during which 90 % of ic - patients present with characteristic mucosal UNK after bladder distension .    3.359445357528719
biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy .    3.591739802228239
potassium - leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity .    3.355877257916731
similarly , complex determinations of novel ic markers ( histamine , tryptase , cytokines , growth factors , substance p , nitric oxide ) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects .    3.211775371941636
according to UNK , which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental UNK of signs , objects , and UNK , pain is considered to be a sign ( significant ) with very different meanings ( significance ) either as a naturalistic symptom ( of disease ) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context .    3.5502415473176194
when following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as UNK UNK on equal terms .    3.853927378412551
in graeco - roman medical UNK pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease , but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body .    3.4814957496475185
especially in the corpus UNK dating from the 5th and 4th century b . c . this UNK and at the same time psychosomatic attitude can be noticed .    2.8771690313074534
aristotle ( 4th century b . c . ) , celsus ( 1st century a . d . ) , and the famous experimental UNK galen ( 2nd century a . d . ) agreed that pain was a sign of UNK which should be UNK without exception .    3.1680878585481853
it was galen who added the disturbance of function ( UNK UNK ) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well - known cardinal signs of celsus ( rubor , UNK , tumor , UNK ) .    3.841000580042237
he also UNK the term UNK to characterize an attack of migraine .    3.150556875681365
in UNK , galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology .    3.278085737608755
on the other hand , pain was designed as a multi - dimensional symbol by the famous graeco - roman UNK UNK .    2.7063972408431702
in homer ' s UNK ( 8th century b . c . ) , pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the UNK ' s leg like an identification UNK , whereas in UNK ' s UNK ( 1st century b . c . ) pain UNK weakness and UNK which can only be UNK by the UNK UNK .    3.4228230266332282
in this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed .    3.0116516052281277
attention is mainly focused on detection of residual UNK .    3.308477986864969
new insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed .    3.1957440046393786
surprisingly in this context , despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring , its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine .    3.7914158646426186
a lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring .    3.419697121505293
three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair .    3.131292110645862
history revealed that all of them UNK regularly in private swimming pools .    3.2526068898730327
examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair .    3.6916955161246974
this UNK discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools .    2.9513420114881503
a 62 - year - old female patient presented with bullous , intensely itching cutaneous lesions , which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis UNK ( UNK ' s disease ) .    3.1230580947185964
therapy with dadps was unsuccessful .    2.949428579976363
because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly , a lymph node biopsy was taken .    3.1892189887471627
histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis : angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy ( aild ) - type t - cell lymphoma .    3.737596743215802
intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma .    3.0951257195833977
these skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations .    3.6327057235583675
this case report is the first report of aild with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature .    2.7284408998014134
background : the procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view .    2.7642382210790646
the purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0 . 2 - t mri unit and a 1 . 0 - t mri unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament .    3.0125854357483317
twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent mri of the knee on both 0 . 2 - t and 1 . 0 - t mri units .    3.7064376991518673
three independent UNK evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament .    3.4473739602230564
frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities , and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic .    3.1050043969214807
sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1 . 0 - t unit ; the 0 . 2 - t unit detected primary signs in 15 / 16 ( 93 % ) patients and secondary signs in 7 / 12 ( 43 % ) patients .    2.912635110921794
in 8 patients the 1 . 0 t unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament ; in these patients the 0 . 2 - t unit detected primary signs in 1 / 8 cases ( 12 % ) , and secondary signs in 3 / 8 cases ( 37 % ) .    3.1950588706755565
observer agreement was very good for the 1 . 0 - t unit and fair for the 0 . 2 - t unit .    2.8428600948351
there is no substantial difference between 1 . 0 - t units and 0 . 2 - t mri units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament .    2.7994907782064895
in the visualisation of secondary signs , 1 . 0 - t units are superior to 0 . 2 - t units , and there is a surprisingly high rate of false - positive results with the 0 . 2 - t unit .    3.5104041407379403
as to the reproducibility of the results , the 1 . 0 - t unit is far superior to the 0 . 2 - t unit .    3.195712016940144
purpose of our study was to develop a reliable model to define clinical stage i UNK germ cell tumors ( nsgct ) being at low risk and at high risk for occult retroperitoneal metastases based on pathohistological and immunohistochemical parameters in order to UNK the therapeutic approach .    3.3227246496764726
3 - 5 paraffin - embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage i nsgct were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage : presence / absence of vascular invasion , presence / absence of UNK invasion , percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor .    3.1136365700776345
immunohistochemical expression of mib - 1 , p53 , bcl - 2 , cathepsin d and e - cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring UNK .    2.7965631651862233
statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models .    3.016353616690749
percentage of embryonal carcinoma [ % ec ( p < 0 . 001 ) ] and presence of vascular invasion [ vi ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage ii disease .    3.160542101578723
combination of % ec and vi allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients .    3.219311707111101
cut - off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131 / 149 patients ( 88 % ) .    2.9315057876783586
less than 45 % ec and absence of vi correctly identified pathological stage i disease in 91 . 5 % ; more than 80 % ec and presence of vi correctly predicted pathological stage ii in 88 % of the patients .    3.1441456919833195
% ec and presence / absence of vi appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease .    3.456011493060987
p53 , bcl - 2 , mib - 1 , cathepsin d and e - cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage i nsgct .    3.0394318120261254
in the framework of rheumatic illnesses , the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved .    3.2551990363466325
dependent on the basic illness in question , conditions of the bronchoalveolar system , vessels , lymphatic system , and pleura that have developed differently inter - and intraindividually can be diagnosed in UNK variable forms and combinations .    3.3045694985550678
in the causal pathogenesis , the initial ( auto - ) immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role .    3.3320404549438263
when the monocytes , macrophages , and fibroblasts are activated , as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation , which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis .    3.2847119197840313
the incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the UNK illness ( e . g . , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , progressive systemic scleroderma , dermatomyositis and polymyositis , sjögren syndrome , and mixed connective tissue disease ) .    3.0685510066811617
in addition to vasculitis and UNK of the lung , therapy - induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition .    3.545464373690481
good knowledge of the parameters from the viewpoint of possible therapeutic measures is indispensable , as is close cooperation between the treating physician and the pathologist .    3.4897460807908445
scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes ; in other words it assesses regional perfusion , permeability , UNK accumulation and bone turnover .    3.0947539389238496
these processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics .    3.563901494392809
this review ( 1 ) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures , ( 2 ) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and ( 3 ) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures .    3.4722322845337423
in summary , we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation .    2.880630982526762
a negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases .    3.1172560810374526
the comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history .    3.131638779769148
in cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation ) , leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step ; in chronic processes ( UNK inflammation ) , UNK scintigraphy is advisable .    3.4230810774712777
other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands .    3.321028526140972
spect is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head , spine and large joints .    3.5198061735577424
to assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation , 106 eyes ( 51 eyes with primary open - angle glaucoma , 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma , 10 eyes with narrow - angle glaucoma , 23 eyes with other UNK ) of 87 patients were treated .    2.894846168522197
using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe , ending in a focusing tip , all eyes were treated with 24 - 30 spots over 360 ° and 2 . 8 - 3 . 6 j of energy , 1 . 5 mm posterior to the UNK .    3.5580369666062404
the intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8 - 24 months after operation .    3.650009417588747
additionally , morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound UNK .    4.0251526430975035
our objective was to determine the efficacy of eswl treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures .    4.708132819343955
in a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone - free rate in children after eswl treatment .    2.7556742192773007
we report a 44 - year - old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures .    3.4767064313531533
histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma .    4.106052715537267
this tumor represents a special entity of UNK that rarely occurs in adults .    3.014943284421623
there is no UNK opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor UNK differently .    2.8813653683075486
the question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open .    3.154785292770716
the decision depends on the given case .    3.6149434492398753
nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue .    3.669470705215375
the safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows UNK spread into the surrounding tissue .    3.0033846036260914
cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( cpx ) is a non - invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise .    3.4832387681723542
determination of oxygen uptake ( vo2 ) and carbon dioxide output ( UNK ) describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism .    3.654119713325522
an incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange , ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders .    3.856132476627124
at rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters .    3.8575644486000438
during exercise , the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are UNK by a reduced anaerobic threshold , reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse .    3.4778733102576007
our study shows that cpx is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders .    2.755059721893646
monitoring of ph of the esophagus is a routine diagnostic procedure , whereas until now ph - monitoring of the hypopharynx has been used only for scientific research .    3.542030774198295
in the present study a critical evaluation scale was used to record the results of 112 patients who underwent ph monitoring to determine possible reflux .    3.898238857517587
since high UNK often remain unnoticed clinically , further study is required in certain cases .    3.5312632770278705
the extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx .    3.2882313100392055
in such cases 24 - h ph monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of " gastric UNK " .    3.2486569657548396
the occurrence of UNK giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes .    3.440432770183598
in babies and infants , these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia .    3.0980335893656727
viral infections and / or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults ( adult giant cell hepatitis , UNK ) , which is much rarer .    3.7560744685274514
in some of the cases , there were UNK high titers against UNK .    3.5871150641337595
giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of hiv infection .    4.151807140365508
these both indicate an infectious cause .    3.1415159349476967
however , the disease cannot be transmitted to UNK .    2.845793862233923
apart from our case , only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis a infection could be demonstrated UNK .    4.062711704818466
in addition , the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient .    2.6373249743327873
this autoimmune phenomenon is probably of crucial pathogenetic significance in our patient , especially since a hepatitis a infection on its own does not afford an adequate etiological explanation for the form of chronic and active hepatitis with consecutive UNK transformation observed here .    3.2766383883823624
in patients with a significant elongation of the acl we propose a new therapeutic regimen .    3.290069066216387
after mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the acl we UNK the bone block with the attached acl distally .    3.0150580084032477
in accordance with this method , we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the acl : the tibial insertion is UNK , the bone block with the attached acl removed from the joint .    4.6251474276041815
ex vivo sutures are placed into the acl , the ligament is pulled back into the joint , and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block .    3.9205510402865595
purpose : one aspect of biocompatibility of iols can be tested using UNK microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo .    3.0849772001153957
background : the paper focuses on the issues , how couples cope with UNK and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children , self - help and professional support .    3.350112223382882
methods : in a retrospective study , 60 couples , members of a self - help organization , were studied at the average of 5 years ( 2 - 215 months ) after their loss .    3.3709101950399836
depression , anxiety , physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires .    3.091183948291031
a community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls .    3.0644620971185876
results : average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample .    3.470887544545459
men and women UNK differently with the loss : UNK mothers were more depressed and UNK more about cause and UNK of the death than fathers .    3.7452360848415065
they expressed their grief more UNK and found it more helpful to speak about their loss .    2.96943756353596
the presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss ; an early subsequent pregnancy was UNK with increased anxiety .    3.207024565381403
conclusions : the self - help group serves an important function as a coping resource ; the UNK plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families .    3.2863626523321985
a 63 - year - old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine .    2.802497820504781
this reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema .    3.296944770089706
we discuss the signs and symptoms , pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine - induced livedo reticularis .    3.2317702394850416
despite the diagnostic criteria of the icd - 10 and dsm - iv , the term borderline has been used in a non - specific way for a long time .    3.7338373510249796
for our investigation we constructed a questionnaire , which contained the icd - 10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder ( bpd ) , plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder .    3.444246183611165
the two additional criteria for the bpd used by the dsm - iv were added .    3.549807371247948
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria , which they thought were typical for the bpd .    3.4070455337815377
92 , 0 % of the questionnaires contained marked criteria for the diagnosis of the bpd by icd - 10 and 96 , 3 % by dsm - iv .    3.9872694995394884
in addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis .    2.899958078092139
this is a sign for the difficulty to separate the bpd from other UNK disorders or the schizotype disorder by using UNK criteria .    3.0751608931300853
looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality disorders , e . g .    3.0006931429522674
for the bpd which has been discussed by many authors for years , modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered .    3.717016408555822
neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self - injurious behavior .    3.820813358804692
the efficacy of UNK drugs has been questioned .    3.0506702349394144
opened and controlled investigations have shown UNK is effective for reducing self - injurious behaviour in mentally retardation .    3.230571802470421
we report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open - label UNK for 12 weeks . they participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the UNK behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule ( das ) .    3.067864738602674
purpose : to test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy ( vcb ) in the diagnosis of UNK indeterminate lesions .    3.04950873848734
materials and methods : 120 patients ( 131 lesions ) were examined using vcb with UNK or UNK vacuum core .    3.466071552236847
radiologic information systems ( ris ) and picture UNK and communication systems ( pacs ) are becoming increasingly widespread .    2.9661845288718895
this leads to new demands on the integration of the individual , formerly independent information systems ( ris , modalities , pacs ) .    3.0842615959839574
possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced .    2.7839426415315285
besides the detailed description of different UNK of system communication , its role in the pacs at the university hospital in freiburg is explained .    3.435418885472874
the integration of different information systems still requires the use of UNK UNK .    3.3151896252979403
an appropriate integration generally has been realized in freiburg .    3.0607756329134532
in the near future dicom basic UNK management will standardize system integration and render an UNK workflow concept possible .    2.729648230198523
even though an available communication standard exists , not all problems in the ris - modality interface are solved .    2.956151271681888
different data models in the various UNK systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard .    3.1544344734431524
thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard .    3.070206721637594
background : UNK developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of UNK and UNK cranial nerve .    3.6111000709663226
these four steps are the following : UNK of the cricopharyngeal muscle , resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall , UNK of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative .    4.362912168575224
reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient .    3.5805056886672597
methods of navel reconstruction are found in the literature but do not provide an UNK solution to the problem .    4.065310552923361
our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure , by creation of two opposing UNK skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body ; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the UNK UNK .    3.0709366673372918
mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer .    3.687411773296784
data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials , the largest series being presented from sweden .    3.060387782642429
mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50 - 59 years .    3.8650478335928584
in younger women ( 40 - 49 years ) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant .    3.4508113990486335
nevertheless , the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non - palpable tumor < = 10 mm in size .    3.4737817527707757
the treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long - term survival rates of > = 90 % .    3.1422346260310743
mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the usa , canada , UNK and sweden for women in their 5th decade of life .    3.324522819292386
starting yearly lifelong mammography - screening at the age of 40 , the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0 . 1 % .    3.023630932066424
under highly qualified conditions , it should be possible to minimize false - positive and false - negative screening results .    3.2421362286329227
in germany , screening - mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer .    3.1694109314649634
based on medical data , mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40 , although there are still open questions needing further clinical research .    3.3261040625724347
upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights .    2.9902027205196204
however , the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations .    2.7561610391061135
we therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well - tolerated UNK implants .    2.9903507894201367
methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research .    3.0255029204844237
so far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature , which reduces the comparability of results from different authors .    3.4081316350654314
therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows german industrial standards ( UNK 53 UNK ) .    2.8510522187189844
the experimental set - up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps .    2.71235870603865
the UNK - shaped specimen consist of UNK prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested .    3.4672601455109646
well - known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to UNK the precision of the experimental set - up .    3.897636377519738
reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds ( n = 120 ) was possible .    3.8125793159701344
we recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures .    2.6263613967975012
abstract an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system .    3.1161545312897707
with the increasing numbers of hiv infections , some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with hiv and arterial aneurysm .    3.1205942984196438
however , complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare .    3.1201893479390144
partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance .    2.8899140432448527
it may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation .    3.1360593020949654
although this is well established , nasogastric tubes are commonly used , because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure .    3.2965714587720716
a new technique for fixing orogastric tubes was tested in a prospective study in 11 preterm and term infants over a 4 weeks period .    2.9448773833115074
there was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients .    3.2483810313198873
the orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 UNK aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube .    3.5603435773434513
on the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86 , 2 % for all patients and 92 , 5 % for patients below 8 weeks of age .    3.7694868232626453
mesenchymal neoplasms of UNK differentiation are the most common soft - tissue neoplasms in adults .    4.162348078191978
in recent years a number of " new " entities and variants have been described .    3.282531376735419
their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy .    2.9483178312572615
chondroid lipoma , UNK , and purely cutaneous spindle - cell / pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically .    3.35863693133561
spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour ( well - differentiated liposarcoma ) and must be distinguished from UNK liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma .    3.302220878201135
the advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes .    3.1234383002066703
the intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the UNK .    3.5096712391078935
in patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure .    3.0403418299252403
we report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure ( icp ) and failure of conservative icp treatment .    2.569708200442492
all four patients had survived a severe neurological disease ( encephalitis , subdural haematoma , stroke ) which required craniectomy to control raised icp .    2.8608930838747875
all were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and ct scans showed no space - occupying lesion anymore .    2.858655897842153
the patients showed a typical " UNK pattern " at the UNK site .    3.787196287676173
all patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation ( i . e .    2.658806471181635
after craniectomy , transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased icp .    3.6696821208575674
it is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure , which is enhanced by changes in the csf compartment following lumbar puncture .    3.550694417273194
lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and , when necessary , only be performed in the head - down position .    4.381167190831548
acute therapy in these cases is quite simple ; it requires flat or even head - down positioning and early cranioplasty .    3.371086358024108
diseases of the oral cavity , floor of the mouth , and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing .    2.8861478077427236
these disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion .    3.1016835677875614
it was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer - assisted quantitative analysis procedure .    3.136822779080103
video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with UNK of different etiologies were analysed .    4.140812293824806
a numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged ( bolus , air , muscles of the tongue , floor of the mouth , UNK , etc . ) .    2.8982996063052355
intensity changes of the UNK within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves .    3.671964273387669
the healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves .    2.8151935659321814
these maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue .    3.1004656040834915
patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography .    3.5209701439601067
these appeared as local or general reductions in movement , slow speed motions , repetitive swallowing or UNK additional movements of the tongue during swallowing .    3.004282045715823
clinically - used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers , s - ( + ) - and r - ( - ) - ketamine .    2.652634168015181
previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of s - ( + ) - ketamine to be three times higher than that of r - ( - ) - ketamine .    2.7162415774323465
it was the aim of this study to compare the effects of s - ( + ) - ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters , recovery , and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia ( tiva ) for orthopaedic surgery .    2.788569099358206
forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double - blind , randomised design .    3.332758637854501
for induction of tiva , patients received 0 . 1 mg midazolam , 0 . 5 mg atropine , 1 mg / kg s ( + ) - ketamine or 2 mg / kg racemic ketamine , respectively , 2 mg vecuronium , and 1 . 5 mg / kg suxamethonium .    3.9760444572201488
after intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg vecuronium , a continuous infusion of 2 mg / kg per hour s - ( + ) - or 4 mg / kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery .    3.207910266548836
blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time - points , before induction as well during and after surgery , until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline , noradrenaline ( by high - pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection ) , anti - diuretic hormone ( adh ) , UNK hormone ( acth ) , cortisol ( by radioimmunoassay ) , glucose , and lactate .    3.0750626294284036
in addition , systolic arterial pressure ( sap ) , heart rate ( hr ) , and arterial oxygen saturation were measured , and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were UNK .    3.4752893093847925
the incidence and assessment of UNK and other side effects were reported by the patients .    4.027506460085002
UNK data of the groups were comparable , the mean age of both groups being 68 years .    4.198966338559455
plasma adrenaline , noradrenaline , adh , acth , cortisol , and glucose as well as sap and hr increased significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) during the course of anaesthesia .    3.3887828051618563
the influence on lactate levels was not significant .    3.236614011882863
there were no differences between s - ( + ) - and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters .    2.912036618669821
three patients in the ketamine - racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study .    3.4132487775105806
recovery clearly improved after administration of s - ( + ) - ketamine compared to the racemate .    3.42045722715246
simple orders were followed after 2 . 0 + / - 3 . 4 versus 4 . 9 + / - 6 . 8 min ( p = 0 . UNK ) , orientation with respect to person returned after 5 . 7 + / - 4 . 0 versus 14 . 6 + / - 10 . 0 min ( p < 0 . 001 ) and spatial orientation after 8 . 2 + / - 5 . 4 versus 17 . 4 + / - 9 . 7 min ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    3.6812163016746773
in the s - ( + ) - group , 1 positive dream was reported .    3.0307556293590068
no intraoperative awareness was reported , and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again .    3.113282521365225
increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to adh , acth , and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during tiva with ketamine .    3.2353505306001002
with regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters , the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and s - ( + ) - ketamine were comparable .    2.768664387335062
because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load , s - ( + ) - ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine .    2.854414405599177
the closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying , if a free transplant is necessary .    3.0825709248658213
following the technique of UNK described first in UNK , several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined .    3.4688461658961143
we report on 14 patients ( ages 41 - 88 years ) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors ( 5 melanomas , 5 basal cell carcinomas , 1 keratoacanthoma , 1 UNK cyst , 1 squamous cell carcinoma , 1 skin metastasis ) were successfully closed by this method .    3.0873167870060807
the diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm ( mean 5 , 7 cm ) .    3.5293654291702237
size and number of the rotating flaps ( 3 or 4 ) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue .    3.9074279967864003
the procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases .    3.8249770621917083
wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases .    3.360160945396525
2 patients ( 63 years , 70 years ) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps .    2.875393206489507
in a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter , one flap of four underwent total necrosis .    3.019865573034323
the cosmetic result was rated " very good " in 71 , 4 % and " good " in 14 , 3 % .    3.1566606158179735
the preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage .    3.4426205313262326
the " windmill procedure " is an important addition to the surgical approaches for closure of large defects on the scalp , particularly in young patients .    3.592966219223482
intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels .    3.680027329560602
despite systematic diagnostics , distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult .    2.9641638548701286
we report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery .    3.096531826936216
the operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery UNK ; however , intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor .    3.509846296010873
therefore , the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation , and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed .    4.163702855261558
a solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices .    3.098949381606006
complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries .    3.829617872350061
surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures .    2.8566453082016303
since , thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively , patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery .    3.9071005179592793
abstract a rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein .    4.219499271036155
only 28 cases are reported in the literature .    2.689935481254389
we treated a 20 - year - old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies , one operation and one mri ; finally , phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins .    2.8778092811879503
to avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed .    3.411288189973741
twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft .    3.576779070718139
hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages : ( 1 ) stigmatization of the patient ; ( 2 ) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion ; ( 3 ) in many patients , the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect ; ( 4 ) acoustic feedback when amplification is high .    3.7422888506288263
conventional hearing aids transmit sound into the ear canal via a small microphone .    3.192009516037526
sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission .    3.275171979066046
this along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned .    3.3942175399175465
in contrast , implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations .    2.6835485364712848
an implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid .    3.203070844715942
the hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system UNK the air .    2.9963384799116057
this implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane , the ossicular chain , the perilymph of the inner ear , or the skull .    3.474997413360177
corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines .    3.614780485042627
as the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions , we investigated the effect of endotoxin from e . coli on organ cultured donor UNK with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density .    3.0939198418071365
for the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss ( snhl ) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results .    2.699875045970651
for these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed , allowing distortion - free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids .    3.2530471392235483
the external parts of partial implants , however , may result in a patient ' s stigmatization .    4.185475156132292
recently , we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of snhl ( UNK 46 [ 1998 ] UNK - 863 ) .    3.574929743179693
here we report the first implantations of this unique , totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with snhl : UNK UNK UNK UNK .    3.5810189346644052
the implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum .    2.9430543133234397
the signal is processed by a UNK programmable multichannel UNK located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear .    3.054876186709984
a piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and UNK the ossicular chain by vibratory actions .    3.3987443690048593
energy is provided by an implantable battery .    3.9147410342956244
implanted patients describe hearing as being distortion - free and transparent .    3.4883750804575904
speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved .    3.2175964494064386
patients may achieve better speech discrimination , especially in the presence of background noise .    3.9726697504456765
the aid can be used during sports , including swimming .    4.060137848086467
to our knowledge , this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients .    2.273988632830678
these results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study .    3.23209497621112
catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy ( rf ) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias .    3.9618585170494316
in patients with ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) , the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease .    3.986711236281659
in the following report we give a definition of the terms nomenclature and classification .    3.027116111477816
we find out , that the two terms are very similar .    3.9794630856544377
they include the keys for diagnosis and therapy .    3.4430771403264497
we propose a method to construct new coding - systems .    2.752929956145504
furthermore we report about the existing coding - systems in orthopaedics and traumatology .    3.34265022744378
we UNK a list of national and international coding - systems .    2.9115074225402
because of the UNK we finally give a definition of the term " UNK UNK " , which is of importance since the " 5 .    3.754122698215658
UNK " of the " bpflv - 95 " within the classification of the " fallpauschalen " .    4.268467771401605
" fallpauschalen " are a system like the american drg ' s ( diagnosis related groups ) , but not UNK the same .    3.5061683334207543
resection of a UNK colon tumor in an 89 - year - old male patient led to the diagnosis , unusual at this age , of an inflammatory pseudotumor ( UNK : plasma cell granuloma ) of the retroperitoneum and UNK , which invaded the large bowel and showed infiltration of one regional lymph node .    4.051898711064089
histology and immunohistochemistry ( demonstrating a UNK phenotype of the proliferating spindle cells and UNK of UNK present plasma cells ) of the specimen resembled previously reported lesions in various locations .    3.5754335129557404
the etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory UNK are not yet unequivocally UNK .    3.451257043227165
the recently published UNK that such lesions of the retroperitoneum represent a separate entity with features of a malignant neoplasm is discussed .    3.333544595639556
an example of a plexiform UNK tumour ( pft ) is presented for the first time in the german - language literature .    3.5479757415806574
the diagnostic criteria for this rare soft - tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood , which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur , include the plexiform structure which gives it its name , extensive UNK deposits and numerous UNK - like giant cells .    3.2210313403007653
the development of the tumour described here , which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant UNK excised 7 years previously , indicates the possibility of induction of pft by radiation .    3.7303948350544616
the current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system .    3.689386626953017
two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients .    4.176998407932531
study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time , including scene time , is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be UNK .    3.6072973215584025
it has , however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20 % of the total scene time , thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time .    3.94963975732553
correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears UNK .    3.2925100982899504
the treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating UNK injuries .    3.5777867783228356
small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients , although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed .    3.89741480697216
endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients .    3.041718751285111
unfortunately , for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious .    3.573274500461407
the importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube UNK regurgitation , aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality .    3.1270565285700838
the common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms , as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation , have been widely investigated .    3.6727557354478417
nevertheless , various aspects of their application are still controversial .    3.2332381315774965
the most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression .    2.788008054320127
new methods of UNK mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation , such as UNK cpr or UNK cpr , have shown promising results in animal experiments .    3.3498140171360262
however , the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome .    3.27744619678987
the efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated , particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation .    3.4876351501646217
it has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation UNK ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival .    2.987901625321361
the present generation of defibrillators has been further improved , particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms , which may reduce the required energy , as well as possible complications , while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size .    3.764508204433607
scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts , but in particular for their application under quality control conditions .    3.6411861345466323
politicians require an improvement in the quality of the validation of emergency measures , although the instruments available for the investigation of these measures are known to be obsolete ( experimental models , experimental design ) .    3.7435042916879038
additionally , the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being UNK low priority by public research funds such as the german research fund .    3.0909527663424714
however , in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies .    2.9642961603426587
the prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings .    3.656672356273774
cross - sectional imaging modalities , including sonography , ct and mri , have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers .    3.122272306169305
their staging criteria are based on the well - established UNK staging system .    4.15050053052497
ct and mri UNK with sonography , which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis .    3.703317693712352
this paper reviews the role of sonography , ct and mri in the staging of gynecologic malignancies .    3.1872530900508003
it UNK the emphasis on mri , which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer , and which seems slightly superior to ct in the staging of ovarian cancer .    3.5095596272325493
UNK UNK represent one group of deep UNK .    3.284695045890362
these aggressive UNK tumorlike lesions have a strong tendency to local infiltration , with a recurrence rate of about 40 % .    3.6854019282183343
trauma , hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors .    2.8548443940384534
shoulder , chest wall , back and thigh are favored sites .    3.065306083821116
by combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few .    4.343767313517475
while in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy , nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation , hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important .    3.3412211667413017
amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly .    3.4667773528791352
UNK syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of UNK , known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis .    4.205724732201808
we report on an eleven year - old boy , who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to UNK .    3.0107097841409165
remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma - antigens .    3.142213541944801
six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting UNK of schistosoma haematobium in the urine .    3.3538977624582547
UNK examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative .    3.12313417261324
there is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in germany today .    3.6815976209587924
most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or UNK is time consuming and complicated .    4.135727238738805
the main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years .    3.1210950465637497
the definition of chronic pain is a UNK noxious input modulated and UNK by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors .    3.738857660423956
it is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice .    2.668170738933283
only a multidisciplinary and intensive UNK will prevail , as discussed in this article .    3.2582251771617488
unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in UNK just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment .    3.448549386008286
the use of somato - sensory evoked potentials ( sep ) in UNK reconstructions has been well accepted .    3.1936226292915384
however , reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic sep alterations differ widely .    2.861552483138305
incidence , risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated .    3.4500456603109484
in only 1 . 7 % of cases sep examination was inadequate .    3.705115058898889
during UNK operations sep were altered minimally or not at all .    2.736966887849779
significant changes were UNK during 65 interventions ( 13 . 5 % ) .    3.311162704942287
cross - clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations ( 81 . 5 % ) ; they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance .    3.3369879794708974
as risk factor for cross - clamping ischaemia , only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified .    3.2100142820145194
tyrosine - rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from black african patients .    3.7204756022135745
the pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear , but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed .    3.182599891106781
UNK ' s staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis .    3.308926139070132
we present the case report of a 59 - year - old woman with a UNK of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine - rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon .    2.9760849220838095
pseudoarthrosis and UNK valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by k wires .    3.2115486584942037
however , delayed union and stimulation of the radial UNK with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless .    3.7847297625172205
to prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary ( 4 - day x - ray control ) displaced fractures of the radial condyle , i . e . those with a central gap of more than 2 mm , were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974 .    3.2453354035587694
sixty - six patients ( 41 boys , 25 girls ) with an average follow - up of 10 years ( 2 - 22 years ) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures .    3.3811200733162385
in 5 cases a k wire fixation was performed in view of the UNK of the fragment .    4.119459193145358
two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow .    2.578270974686526
screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases , whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children , probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability .    3.6749155307198347
conclusion : open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by UNK fracture healing in anatomic position within 3 - 4 weeks .    2.7723577047101986
however , fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only .    3.24500922538586
a commercially available c1 inhibitor ( c1 - inh ) concentrate was used for short - term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema .    3.450477810970287
the patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face , extremities , and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary c1 - inh deficiency .    3.1053014573061
both patients were receiving UNK acid or UNK therapy as oral long - term prophylaxis .    3.1323103165539172
over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia , with mask ventilation or intubation .    3.4101905320290915
the c1 - inh plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low ( 0 . 02 - 0 . 06 g / l , normal range 0 . 15 - 0 . 35 g / l ) , despite the oral long - term prophylaxis .    3.872246800219617
substitution treatment with 500 - 1000 u c1 - inh was performed 1 h before surgery .    3.370142492223544
no side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions .    3.0017818753158894
with this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case .    2.797354668583001
the measurement of c1 - inh plasma concentration 2 h or 4 h after c1 - inh substitution showed a marked rise in both patients , though normal values were not reached in either .    3.090342360796535
this case report describes a 62 years old patient who suffered from therapy UNK atrial fibrillation for 12 years .    3.263432117124528
she underwent " cox / UNK - iii - procedure " during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved .    3.3923828980287865
two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm .    3.139801611372429
transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility .    2.9347600278737516
therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and UNK could be discontinued .    3.5966633490026156
two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported : an 11 - year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress .    2.993776532668584
in upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and UNK , and in this case splenopexy was performed .    4.1161221981197045
an otherwise healthy 3 - year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside - down spleen with partial infarction .    3.3875943818408807
diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and ct - scan .    3.0210947333641194
the extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography .    3.0994615856335286
after partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed .    2.863137295533286
discussion : in situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration .    3.0292456283792633
UNK orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards .    3.0281834105913843
in cases of chronic back pain , in particular , there is such a UNK between the clinical findings and the patient ' s subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so - called degenerative changes .    4.125825341139628
back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses , of being treated purely UNK on the basis of associated findings , and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings .    3.540069949764128
particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective UNK factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment .    2.946046836545858
the decision to UNK invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor ' s reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness .    2.6782590133126374
if this situation is to change , an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training , and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice .    3.256616182228069
the laboratory surveillance of measles in germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation .    3.0662708465414936
compared to data of the pre - vaccination era , the incidence of measles has been reduced , while a shift in age towards the group of 15 - year - UNK is observed .    4.409213695396453
germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of UNK measles in the european region by the year UNK .    3.7604804995619663
apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking , the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot .    2.891535018519032
in order to effectively control measles , high vaccination rates of at least 90 % are necessary by the end of the second year of life .    3.296267909531633
in addition , laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination .    3.4355070373715293
main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases , UNK studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses .    3.7599239149267545
the working group measles ( " arbeitsgemeinschaft UNK " - UNK ) as well as the UNK law on infection prevention are important instruments to make measurable progress towards measles eradication also in germany .    3.294784183236711
we report on the activities of the national reference centre for measles , mumps and rubella since 1991 .    2.585835854165431
the different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of " brittle nails " and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared .    3.975745424504056
at this time , measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails .    3.6369802643615543
reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy .    3.6589315933618796
measurement of the UNK water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully , but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility , confirmed .    4.171230322860113
the case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described .    3.4917235762825327
this combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature .    3.282128077329571
the sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable , probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule .    3.4292317685529112
immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result .    3.22077427683695
the management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently .    3.5282927958966592
surgeons ' education , preclinical rescue structures , initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies , as well as diagnostic imaging , have progressed .    3.675503945554736
plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of ct . fast imaging techniques ( spiral ct ) have led to the inclusion of ct in the primary survey .    3.5527110963062714
to minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time , algorithms have to be defined concerning structures , emergency room equipment and quality .    3.580679082174037
the importance of hepatitis c virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy .    3.57424605857569
in a collaborative research project of the committees for the study of idiopathic cardiomyopathy , hepatitis c virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients ( 10 . 65 ) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of UNK patients ( 6 . 3 % ) with dilated cardiomyopathy ; these UNK were significantly higher than that found in UNK blood donors in UNK .    3.5517586573704385
hepatitis c virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11 , UNK patients ( 5 . 4 % ) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals .    3.9383626786515324
various cardiac abnormalities were found , and arrhythmias were the most frequent .    3.7782474051293833
these observations suggest that hepatitis c virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases .    3.3446741642532487
this study determines the activity of contraction - promoting factors , examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors .    2.8540851185595852
using an in vitro UNK , we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated rpe cells is effectively stimulated by serum , platelet - derived growth factor and insulin - like growth factor - 1 .    3.0174315847106197
endothelin - 1 and transforming growth factor - 1 and - 2 have a more discrete or marginal effect .    3.650350249303376
tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent .    3.15373671675552
contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis , suggesting different active factors and / or pathways .    3.41266415920548
UNK , a broad - spectrum kinase inhibitor , effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated rpe cells regardless of the promoter .    2.543955037490634
we report the case of a 78 - year - old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with UNK syndrome , resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease .    2.69224164021122
due to the high surgical and anesthetic risk we implanted an axillo - bifemoral ptfe graft .    2.7045633000863902
the preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high - grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid - subclavian bypass on the left .    3.893972834186533
this stenosis was dilated and then UNK by way of the proximal end of the axillo - bifemoral graft , which in turn was distally UNK to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery .    3.354677920114396
postoperative angiography verified a good run - off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained .    2.8568756365693906
duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms .    3.9753441467397894
these results demonstrate that , combined with intraoperative stent application , an axillo - bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results .    2.975129936039703
objective : concerning the long - term somatic development of children born with very low birth weight and / or born very premature , there are varying and sometimes contradictory statements .    3.364701228041662
a follow - up study was carried out on premature - born children from UNK and UNK at pre - school and early school age in order to investigate the long - term somatic development of these children .    3.5538837035077004
anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group .    4.438306288582167
mediastinitis caused by infection with clostridium UNK and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions .    3.5558599520422156
the combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38 - year - old woman .    2.9175441222453227
the patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen .    2.678588220733836
the lack of information regarding emesis , the leading symptom of UNK ' s syndrome , caused delayed diagnosis : the triad of emesis , severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms .    3.213334196140034
for ethical and socio - economical reasons ( cost - explosion in transfusion - medicine , patient ' s individual destiny ) , UNK and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a UNK - UNK to anesthesiologists , surgeons and blood - UNK .    3.792639301265311
the combination of different techniques , i . e .    2.7637293332114026
autologous UNK , hemodilution , choice of anesthetic regimen , deliberate hypotension , application of anti - fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage .    2.903473619454258
introduction : if the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place , he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively .    3.0700021257098076
different procedures are recommended : reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place , UNK of the inferior oblique muscle , and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the UNK eye .    4.185487995597965
no quantitative recommendations on the surgical amount are mentioned in the literature .    2.8004470318196524
in 180 children ( 87 children belonging to a control group , 68 with fever of non - renal origin , and 25 with pyelonephritis ) albumin and immunoglobulin g ( markers for glomerular dysfunction ) , - 1 - microglobulin and - nag ( markers for proximal tubular dysfunction ) and UNK a1 ( marker of ' postrenal ' dysfunction ) were measured in second - voided morning urine .    3.126042415625539
in children with fever of non - renal origin , glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8 . 8 % , tubular dysfunction in 17 . 6 % and mixed glomerular - tubular dysfunction in 14 . 7 % of cases .    3.2230899671929474
among children with pyelonephritis , 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular - tubular dysfunction .    2.7812427593441993
no case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis .    4.223729243067808
there were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non - renal origin and children with pyelonephritis ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction , the differences were only moderately significant ( - nag : p < 0 . 01 ) or of low significance ( - 1 - microglobulin : p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.1481389492887706
this may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of UNK , resulting in glomerular dysfunction , while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever - associated function processes .    3.3299402436835845
up to the middle of the UNK , chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma , and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today .    4.004453853500477
there are indications for chemotherapy , which can theoretically be used as follows :    3.918893709028035
we compared a cw carbon dioxide flash - scanning laser system to an er : yag laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial UNK .    2.8045370927285083
in all patients , co2 laser treatment showed a better cosmetic result whereas erythema and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation were less marked in er : yag laser therapy .    2.717279619828677
a separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal UNK tubes manufactured by immersion technique .    3.240359391413683
diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably UNK the obstruction .    3.0853937949054733
this can lead to life - threatening situations .    3.285801517747621
we observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of UNK anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems .    2.7428676079861662
this is caused by UNK defects and above all by damage UNK in UNK .    3.5202841949006056
therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully .    2.9302333219016403
a too - high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation .    2.8059530986989225
the tubes should never be processed more than 80 times .    3.2888066994384273
routine examination of the tubes is imperative , especially at the predilection sites for layer separation .    3.324476501398519
severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults .    4.000734340136658
between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults ( 4 % of entire population operated for coarctation ) .    3.618236628153333
UNK aortic valves were present in 2 / 3 of patients .    3.7860787536719855
in 10 patients ( 710 with aortic stenosis ) coarctation was operated early ( mean age 24 years ) and aortic valve late ( mean age 40 years ) : in 14 ( UNK with aortic regurgitation , mean age 40 years ) aortic valve and coarctation were operated simultaneously ( 8 patients ) or staged within 6 months ( 6 patients ) .    3.34370968124377
additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta UNK were performed in 8 , mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto - coronary bypass in 1 patients .    3.1175213451450423
early mortality was 224 ( 8 % ) and was similar in simultaneously ( 18 ) and staged ( 114 ) operated cases : 10 year survival was lower than in an age - matched group of 72 patients with aortic valve disease of similar severity operated during the same period ( 70 % vs 88 % , p < 0 . 01 ) : 67 late deaths were cardia ; 55 pts with preoperatively severely increased end - diastolic ( > 199 mlm2 ) and 44 with end - systolic ( > 90 mlm2 ) left ventricular volumes and 22 with ejection fraction < 41 % died late postoperatively .    3.045338607690936
abstract 13 experienced addiction therapists UNK - UNK information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients ( 26 women and 96 men ) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse .    3.1784402365277558
42 % had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men .    3.537185402838168
the UNK UNK took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption .    3.3457647825854893
26 % of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post - traumatic stress disorder .    4.330095905798314
in comparison with individuals without trauma experiences , victims UNK significantly more comorbid symptoms , they more frequently suffered from UNK and had more experiences with psychotherapy .    3.083240213446931
nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types .    3.9908621205904877
careful UNK testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance , in order to discover the underlying causative agent .    3.7697037627380223
skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics .    3.44911820422544
rast - and ria - tests and / or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally .    3.613424255179703
together with all other administered drugs , all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers ( suxamethonium , vecuronium , pancuronium , UNK , atracurium , mivacurium ) should be tested , since they often represent the cause for such reactions .    3.399485126783927
for other classes of drugs ( for example , volatile anesthetics and opioids ) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain .    3.159020337813228
for less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus , or exanthems , skin testing seems to be less relevant .    3.274176988689189
nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage .    3.7466279734244488
human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away .    3.0503138653694957
they learn by pain to avoid these situations in future .    3.2681722048616084
shortly after major injury , there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger , later on , emerging pain UNK the body to rest and supports UNK .    3.3756809093740214
it induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative , appetite and vigilance .    2.8993976171594524
it reduces life - quality , often accompanied by depressive UNK .    3.354393061779066
acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception ( hyperalgesia ) .    3.6197350143963423
during healing , the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks .    3.0738421662140625
sometimes , unknown factors initiate chronification of pain .    2.790341739898625
changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce " cellular early genes " [ 24 ] , a synthesis of c - fos , c - jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain .    3.0725483560193965
all efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development .    3.5636781539913747
one of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique : incision , extension , limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible .    3.187001552849712
however , nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central UNK .    3.1359422541045907
postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing .    2.996181544440382
pain induces a reduction of ventilation , circulation , digestion and increases the risk of other disorders .    3.82855060849996
there is need of aggressive pain treatment for UNK reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [ 10 ] .    3.0397120045162405
this is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy ( UNK ) .    3.3862309154695365
antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [ 2 , 12 ] .    3.6863994525969477
hence , regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients .    3.1997417803076234
good antinociception may be even more important than it is assumed today .    3.3676935700360504
anaesthesiologists have to reconsider the quality of general anaesthesia : the antinociception of their regimen .    3.875766647869557
in diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large - scale procedures available .    3.2313708633074665
refering to a three - step - scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in i . non - invasive , ii .    3.4775182667511997
invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained .    3.4295858791897627
to the non - invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics , the physical examination and laboratory UNK .    3.2723422548918486
the semi - invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with UNK substances , the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography , the corpus - cavernosum - UNK ( cc - emg ) and other neurophysiological examinations .    3.121502890553443
the third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological UNK and UNK ( UNK ) and the selective pharmacological UNK - arteriography .    3.724582664193022
the procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions .    3.3046179606854547
technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the international workshop on " embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer strategies " organized at the gene center , munich , september 1999 .    3.2053318926628585
the aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and UNK of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and UNK breeding .    3.172031933457661
" biology of embryonic stem cells " , " nuclear transfer strategies " , and " stem cell differentiation - cell therapy " were the main topics of the meeting .    3.4200037519628403
it became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self - UNK and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes .    3.17398198927375
however , data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future .    3.1112897478147414
before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible , further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture ( i . e . , identification of differentiation factors , selective differentiation strategies , UNK gene assays ) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei .    3.282239331411498
certain fractures and / or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post - traumatic osteonecrosis .    3.9854168480043577
however , the more complex etiology of non - traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy , radiotherapy , thermal injuries , and especially coagulopathies , which are now commonly observed in these patients .    3.4337011568280116
intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation , and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent UNK .    3.013399772162133
the aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t - pa and pai - 1 expression from human endothelial cells .    2.5413952650604026
for this purpose , we cultured human endothelium cells , gained from umbilical veins , for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with hellp syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia .    3.0137458181881054
the sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non - pregnant women were used as controls .    3.0105915049348617
we then determined t - pa and pai - 1 levels by elisa , both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures .    2.8198476228304803
while t - pa levels were significantly higher in the serum of patients with preeclampsia and hellp syndrome than in the control group ( median : 8 . 0 ng / ml and 6 . 2 ng / ml vs 3 . 9 ng / ml and 3 . 1 ng / ml ) , levels of pai - 1 did not show any significant UNK among the different groups .    3.699124846701923
the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t - pa ( p < 0 . 001 ) and pai - 1 ( p < 0 . 01 ) when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or hellp syndrome .    3.0060154755906865
the increased expression of t - pa and pai - 1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation .    3.064696365860929
postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods , including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics .    3.742897316210719
on - demand analgesia using a pca ( patient - controlled analgesia ) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia .    3.2739448935979607
while pca devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units , the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy .    3.5899333484831972
the objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses .    2.993388754615875
in a study under double - blind conditions 135 asa i and ii patients were assigned at random to group i ( infusion group ) or group b ( bolus group ) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery .    3.1961546721978844
the patients in group i received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol , followed by an infusion of 12 mg / h tramadol for 24 h ; if necessary , repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given .    3.4558696847708292
in group b the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion ; otherwise , the procedure was the same .    3.625716949057079
pain relief was monitored by means of a vas ( visual analogue scale ) up to 6 h after surgery .    3.5470239038262092
we investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h , how often repetitive boluses were required , and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h . results .    3.7834950694946885
the pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76 . 5 % of group i and 65 . 6 % of group b ; 19 . 1 % of group i and 26 . 9 % of group b assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory ; 4 . 4 % of group i and 7 . 5 % of group b complained of insufficient analgesia .    3.886375191280834
in group i 69 . 2 % requested only one or no repetitive bolus , compared with 40 . 3 % in group b , while two or more boluses were demanded by 30 . 8 % in group i and 59 . 7 % in group b .    3.793734401702116
after 24 h it was UNK . 5 + / - 66 . 0 mg tramadol in group i and 201 . 6 + / - 83 . 9 mg tramadol in group b .    4.001640144526294
while the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable , from then on the consumption in group i increased significantly .    3.804361340329464
side effects were reported by 25 % in both groups .    3.204454406089782
they were clinically UNK and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case .    3.6192605213152422
during the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes .    2.808967755193288
the fact that the patients in group i requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group b and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group .    3.954690626963343
concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side - effects have proven UNK .    3.7131729508094367
six hours after surgery , when analgesia was evaluated by the patients , there was no significant difference between the two groups .    3.4458390881415233
not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h , was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher .    3.3950379694725292
thus , we should consider continuing UNK administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation .    3.205390238629176
the concept of tuberculid was introduced by UNK in 1896 .    3.263152802143989
in contrast to " true " cutaneous tuberculosis , properties of the tuberculids were explained by an UNK response to UNK or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection .    3.2718487084296313
key features include a strongly positive UNK skin test , evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis , and prompt response to antituberculous therapy the inability to culture m . tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies , together with reports on tuberculid - like eruptions after bcg vaccination , supports this concept .    2.861951987201918
clinical manifestations are lichen UNK , papulo - necrotic tuberculids and erythema UNK of UNK .    3.134108702128397
the existence of tuberculids has been questioned , however , because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific .    4.710977725165261
an increasing number of case reports on tuberculids , new immunological tests and molecular biology - based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept .    2.9691099001063876
case report : a 20 - year - old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax .    3.458750457084913
a secondary amenorrhea was coexisting .    3.1769608985336277
on the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible .    3.5063824961625216
chest x - ray and hr - ct showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis x which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue .    3.2852065858084725
the cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary UNK .    3.204274929222634
conventional " consensus - treatment " for adults with vinblastine , prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces .    2.7433108864748363
treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children .    3.460061552329832
this treatment is characterized by higher dosage and combination with 6 - UNK .    3.8625011578857436
the prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor .    3.4855256060742463
the hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70 - 90 % in patients with solid tumors to 75 - 90 % in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95 % in patients after bone marrow transplantation .    3.6297449543902025
this results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients .    2.932010560461385
since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified .    3.199423295769951
a reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures .    3.6438413278554473
patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with UNK is necessary and / or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present .    3.6913747877909406
intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases .    3.7938399713306445
for other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making .    4.148652599699479
the client , the clients ' interaction , and the therapeutic interaction ) , whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change .    3.7647808370386397
interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife , who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change .    3.5029230312123936
for the husband , who preferred the role of a UNK and demonstrated only little motivation for change , results were not as predicted .    3.6519029033139208
some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects .    3.1438183558524844
results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or UNK patient studies .    3.3679359677632745
investigations related to emergency medicine are , however , an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient .    3.6238388658145775
a retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies .    4.153141582750888
frequently , a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study .    3.3519386230093975
informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies .    3.3886616235719482
however , under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness , etc .    2.8100145698637675
nevertheless , the following principles should be observed : ( a ) randomised studies are essential , even in emergency medicine ; ( b ) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group ; ( c ) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment .    3.802324389683693
if the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent , the principle of deferred consent is acceptable .    2.8898457686668313
the deferred consent principle should be carefully documented .    3.203676296928037
a prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation , even under emergency conditions .    3.0651571357841028
emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should , as a rule , not exceed 2 years .    3.7185609381020934
otherwise , too many items might change without being noted .    3.0277462379257316
curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees .    3.284813127418262
if an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors , it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee .    3.5934264572146835
if , however , for example , the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes , the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement .    3.9719163906989308
for multicentre and UNK studies , however , the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non - german ethics committees .    3.4360945791466087
not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care ( e . g . , endotracheal intubation , etc . ) .    3.780693580718495
nevertheless , the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1 - 3 rating proposed by the american heart association .    3.484679198638018
in principle , the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements .    2.8366501044746277
for all studies , particularly in the prehospital setting , an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes .    3.0892035973700662
scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens .    3.667877846253935
UNK in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of ems , personnel qualifications , etc .    3.2510821182689558
this is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine .    2.7936862680528636
the results of emergency medicine investigations should be published in suitable journals , i . e . , journals with a reasonable rating .    2.944642325197733
new antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing UNK .    3.2153161085606516
nevertheless , in daily practice the failure rate is 20 - 30 % both with itraconazole and terbinafine .    3.0830288245212105
in our investigations for the UNK effects of terbinafine , we could show that the same strain of trichophyton UNK or t . UNK in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine ( 2 , 0 to 0 , 002 µg / ml ) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase .    3.8146598857734975
thus resting fungi in the nail are not UNK , and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the mic for the fungi , they can cause a relapse .    3.8316815116448657
itraconazole is a UNK agent .    4.769286960607133
its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the mic for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months .    3.3960758183619357
the usual short - term treatment of UNK over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders , e . g .    3.301986764171363
this paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a " 4 out of 7 " concept : if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value , mode switching ( ms ) is automatically performed .    2.7186779121832605
the technical solution in medtronic kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations .    2.9903072120528105
the " 4 out of 7 " algorithm offers a quick ms ; by the addition of a " UNK flutter search " algorithm integrated into this concept , the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed av intervals .    3.0333858053735825
with the increased rapidity of ms and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection , there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats .    3.314065870568574
therefore , to optimize the ms function , programming of the device ( e . g . , activation of a time delay before ms ) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient .    3.36980972834266
possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration .    2.735829092767507
some guidelines are presented in this paper .    3.3348540722672193
finally , the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance , incidence of atrial arrhythmias , and ( as far as possible ) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac UNK .    3.3388080039993975
between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration .    3.205226809771344
in order to judge operative success on a long - term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow - up .    3.5002301631485193
they then completed a questionaire , in which they were asked about postoperative complaints .    3.5319617456253942
additionally , sinuses were examined by computed tomographic ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mr ) .    2.7244759176008846
among the patients evaluated seven had no complaints , and no evidence of disease could be found by medical examination .    3.855088225296579
ct scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients .    3.305041209126556
in these patients , two - thirds of the fat had been replaced by connective tissue .    2.925566295522601
mr was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus , but the mr images failed to correlate with symptoms .    3.975633605363734
additional results could not be obtained when compared to ct .    4.103804189416726
overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration .    3.712984831649555
the objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy ( slne ) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients .    3.163100458922969
the study presented illustrates the method and our results .    3.2780794066603853
as has been UNK for melanoma , the first lymph node [ sentinel node ( sln ) ] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph - node metastasis .    3.413243731664803
the database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes .    3.2423537318980986
in 11 cases the described method was applicable .    3.1504073037001277
in only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the sln and the axillary specimen .    3.274103579363614
successful completion of examination of a large number of patients with a long follow - up has the potential of reducing the number of axillary dissections and of significantly reducing morbidity in the majority of breast cancer patients .    4.42723494080831
background : information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser UNK ( ltk ) and for postoperative follow - up .    3.3004051509227104
we investigated on acute ltk effects which information images obtained by optical low UNK tomography ( oct ) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy .    2.7955140704656727
in cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery .    3.378614135567872
a review of 262 left main UNK revealed a procedure - related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9 . 1 % ( 4 / 44 ) , in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4 . 8 % ( 1 / 21 ) and 0 . 5 % ( 1 / 187 ) in cases with UNK bypass grafts to either left coronary artery .    3.7364739714843775
coronary angioplasty of an unprotected left main coronary artery , had an UNK high procedure - related mortality rate and should therefore not be performed even in cases of emergency intervention .    3.4551201395853495
the risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection .    3.7702889968300815
hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure .    2.9500329665789935
there are a few reports of UNK children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism .    3.261918559295525
in all these patients , however , cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years .    4.410427584952054
in addition , other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism , e . g . , convulsive seizures , had been present prior to cardiac symptoms .    2.8660205988033036
in this publication , nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms , etiology and pathogenesis .    3.556304238743736
the diseases to be considered when making a differential UNK are pointed out .    3.547509931085688
clarification of the etiology is still pending .    3.9224545176500962
molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings .    3.479645223852783
a case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist .    4.028436107515116
possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated .    3.7995615882137064
the results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty .    2.9555399528829116
the present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical , the UNK the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint .    3.380604278882573
these features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design .    3.1384292425185083
from the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and UNK .    3.5608423115083316
biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i . e . cylindrical mobility , UNK and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle UNK .    3.841756060253547
the prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone , and preferably without cement .    3.385664059274293
only UNK forces should act at the bone - prosthesis interface .    3.3090942647980084
the axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal .    4.235834680126233
meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities .    3.2350959681210942
restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result .    3.207289743925045
the indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis ( primary or traumatic ) and rheumatoid arthritis .    2.963742941679851
contraindications are talus necrosis , charcot joints , extreme osteoporosis , severe arteriosclerosis , and very aggressive arthritis .    2.8798167451975027
mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications .    3.820527446480864
furthermore , the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities .    2.9572659670617303
the average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed .    3.1059299789210626
elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity .    3.9306180630925387
in the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion , restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient ' s chances of regaining UNK UNK .    2.9550679495977814
furthermore , depending on the type of reconstruction , stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time .    3.543794591471058
in order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and / or ventral upper arm muscles , to time the operation appropriately , to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients .    3.6735417999100624
our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution .    3.588166477287718
there were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus .    2.932483997942622
some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle / tendon transfers .    3.099688406867335
in 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer ( n = 10 ) , triceps - to - biceps transfer ( n = 15 ) , modified flexor / pronator muscle mass UNK ( n = 6 ) and multiple - stage free functional muscle transfer after UNK nerve transfer ( n = 4 ) .    3.1115167643121464
the official german guidelines for prevention of intravascular - device - associated infections were published by the bundesgesundheitsamt , now called the robert - koch - institut , 12 years ago .    2.0231316879724237
the recently published official " guidelines for prevention of intravascular - device associated infections " of the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) are categorized according to scientific evidence .    1.8224785228745275
the american guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the UNK german guidelines .    2.361897804883022
the purpose of the present paper is to inform the german - speaking anaesthesiologist about the official cdc guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular - device - associated infections .    2.2670105623777097
we assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced UNK by the kappa cohen interobserver variation analysis using UNK of eight different patients with different diagnoses .    3.332394193175619
arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation .    3.3989184873039533
pathological changes , in contrast , often showed very little correlation , especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar UNK , in the cartilage of the UNK groove and the posterior cruciate ligament .    4.516875951459301
in patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation .    3.436569994856566
clinical relevance : when comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account .    2.9771525492094577
furthermore , these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures .    3.2394783397394753
in addition , medical cost billing , which is based on arthroscopic findings , has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong .    3.429994748063057
squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4 % of all invasive carcinomas of the breast .    4.0855372744314336
primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare , since they occur in less than 1 % of all primary invasive breast carcinomas .    3.9235278136437883
in order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin , especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell UNK from a different location .    3.773260119073004
causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear .    3.9153489477047074
a pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed , considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages .    2.8913802060221037
squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma .    3.4211947590947043
here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role .    3.1318834880202053
the number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years .    3.112138727574552
these tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory UNK .    3.1400959354645046
the limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary ptca in acute myocardial infarction .    3.3762815015092773
randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary ptca as compared to thrombolysis .    4.009341544860156
adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein iia / iiib inhibitors may further reduce mortality .    2.9314337179685794
for logistic and financial reasons however , not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in germany .    3.476125360190585
primary ptca in acute myocardial infarction should be left to experienced centres and investigators .    3.002832068919191
of utmost importance is a reduction of the present " onset - to - opening " times by information campaigns , an improved triage , use of UNK times for pre - hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents .    3.729922962430675
some 245 , 000 sporting accidents occur yearly in switzerland .    2.963559852861075
the social accident costs amount to approximately 1 . 8 UNK UNK per year .    3.540005231373477
every second sporting accident occurs during a ball UNK .    3.0574339378363553
for the shown sporting activities , distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children .    3.4201719086278763
as is to be expected , the number of accidents has grown along with the UNK popularity of UNK and in - line UNK .    4.892328739930924
these new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods .    2.9853141971831194
abstract : the combination of UNK ( meg ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex .    3.210576934546878
however , this method is technically UNK and time consuming .    3.3751615083907853
therefore , functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery .    3.4172267197380655
the aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol , which allows the integration of functional meg data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation , as a routine method .    3.537104595795116
we report on a 15 - year - old girl and her relatives with typical features of ehlers - danlos syndrome type viii .    2.5781309812173787
main symptoms of this disorder are UNK skin , easy UNK , joint UNK , features suggesting premature aging , and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth .    3.0247073043771877
the inheritance of this type of ehlers - danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant .    2.8396244803770756
the biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated .    3.221747002781974
despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe alf have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of alf .    3.7063740995694405
numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques , but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate .    3.555787466689766
liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease .    2.6899275841590877
it is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver ' s essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion .    3.1423171567940447
over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only .    2.932241535813151
this article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems , their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications .    3.5030962771498855
after a latency period of 20 years , in a 39 - year - old austrian UNK of chinese origin , a surgically removed rectal carcinoma , as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node , showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination , convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis .    3.0986413894914713
whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact , whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial .    3.2172076011975537
the etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large - bowel diseases .    3.0396873238923137
in the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia , the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur .    3.1697585709555485
besides a survey of UNK UNK and pathology , the link between rectal carcinoma and schistosomiasis UNK is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations .    4.01171105152669
rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication .    4.356431751192417
mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature .    3.0652247969884354
this paper reports on a 51 - year - old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using v - y technique .    3.2476190017042774
on day 8 after operation , the carotid bulb ruptured .    3.55959247497313
the suture line was not involved .    3.3275695671172976
the rupture was due to local wall necrosis , as verified by histologic examination .    3.354222138457153
in an emergency procedure the UNK tissue was resected and repaired using a dacron patch .    3.304570956454704
postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit .    3.460340092805354
myocardial stunning ( contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion ) and myocardial hibernation ( contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion ) have represented separate concepts of viable , but dyssynergic myocardium in the past .    3.13071085307824
however , in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between UNK and hibernating myocardium .    3.1356941021273848
myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion .    2.987736086944822
with increasing severity and duration of ischemia , degeneration of cardiac myocytes , accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue .    3.183029534494564
UNK , there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis , which in turn limits functional recovery .    3.411628504523894
in the light of these structural features , the available methods for detection of viable myocardium , in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques , offer complementary rather than contradictory information .    3.1445797235416193
dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity , excellent specificity , and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium .    3.2878985077128497
while in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated , newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography .    2.8672298943038594
the complete ( low and high dose ) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses ( sustained improvement in contraction or UNK response , biphasic response , new wall motion abnormality ) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction .    3.0682518126719005
the test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction .    3.716418719454316
a similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction .    3.2831518412718133
since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive , time to revascularization is critical .    3.0565756056656195
on the other hand , responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before UNK a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure .    2.4981338690283934
the coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta .    3.2527719159898267
the coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body .    3.934067299664879
the indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart .    3.3313620097848426
the resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end - to - end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a UNK .    3.6964758303594625
after a vosschulte - aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen .    2.7530378408527527
this method , however , brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm .    4.32963825774044
in the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a vosschulte - aortoplasty .    3.358865548500967
the aging of the italian population is an emerging public health priority .    3.1389730207299444
in UNK italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old .    3.573847161780416
to avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations , we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs .    3.150701956075884
a 14 year old UNK girl was admitted with recurrent UNK abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks .    3.0788233931193147
laboratory check , plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show UNK immediately .    3.301915701249535
increasing enzyme parameters though indicated UNK .    3.1390685717153306
endoscopic retrograde choledocho - UNK ( ercp ) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus .    3.868166641750417
it revealed a common - channel situation ( ductus choledochus and UNK ) and UNK .    3.651556980059457
UNK and stone - extraction could not remove abdominal pain .    2.8494578732582267
laparatomy and choledocho - UNK could finally remove the symptoms .    3.2218506003571723
successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an UNK matrix - synthesis of the transplanted cells .    3.1510126726501517
this , in turn , is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid ( sf ) of the respective joint .    3.5366179716193455
we addressed the question whether analysis of a patient ' s sf can predict the rate of matrix - synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this sf in vitro .    3.985722903922921
sf was obtained from 115 patients with disorders of the knee , including gonarthrosis ( n = 44 ) , meniscal tears ( n = 10 ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( n = 53 ) , and reactive arthritides ( n = 8 ) .    3.9861702553130667
in the sf , the following parameters were determined : interleukin - 1 , il - 6 , il - 8 , il - 1 - ra , tnf , insulin - like growth - factor i ( igf - i ) , igf - ii , igf - binding protein - 2 ( igfbp - 2 ) , igfbp - 3 as well as total proteinase activity and total UNK activity .    3.8628845621859096
to assess the effect of sf on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes , bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of sf , and the rate of UNK synthesis subsequently determined .    3.755602237818123
in some cases , a monoclonal antibody directed against igf - i was added .    3.0901623498145194
sf from patients with oa or trauma , respectively , stimulated pg - synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did sf from patients with rheumatic arthritides .    3.215920298244554
on the average , 60 percent of the sf - induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti - igf - i - ab .    3.1136918980792334
the best predictor for the sf - effects on pg - synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free igf - i ( r = 0 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 , spearman rank correlation ) followed by the sf - concentrations of igf - i ( with a positive sign ) , igfbp - 3 , il - 1 , and tnf ( all with a negative sign ) .    2.9743995158901244
according to our data , igf - i is the most important anabolic factor in human sf with respect to cartilage pg - synthesis .    3.8150106934385812
the proportion of free igf - i seems to be of special importance in this regard .    3.0060262557945587
low sf - levels of free igf - i could be identified as a possible risk - factor for a sub - optimal UNK synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu .    3.317074843746847
the coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon .    3.3659465959325705
however , only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia .    2.980988088744717
this may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder .    3.2145456826283683
we report on a female patient suffering both from UNK with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to icd - 10 .    2.8907985014902633
the productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of UNK , whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy .    4.006412622795506
although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities , the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy .    3.0557818836947184
a 54 - year - old female patient with a 10 - year history of UNK shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported .    2.7943252601447086
transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease .    3.4618728462746007
after many years with only occasional disturbances , a distinct organic brain syndrome developed .    3.125225517579878
thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis ; this was based on the history , liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in ct .    3.588799627330811
despite the initiation of specific therapy , the patient died of the sequelae of the disease .    3.7528286210413273
at autopsy , characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal UNK were found with collapsed parasitic cysts .    2.692974493195651
additional intracerebral mesenchymal - glial reactions were less conspicuous .    3.0540314498051684
residual UNK had caused UNK stenosis .    3.7046947398214143
death was due to UNK , bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess .    3.931560086801713
the clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed .    2.8214290737879515
the disease has become rare in our country , but is UNK the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system .    3.55945410217962
all neonates born in the department of gynecology and obstetrics , university of kiel , were included .    3.33535505137545
in 18 of 18 UNK ( 0 . 98 permil ) UNK neonates ( birth weight 680 - UNK g ; 26 - 41 weeks of gestation ) , the initial hemoglobin level was below 10 g / dl .    3.5963775650271614
in those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6 . 8 permil .    3.3383875788735504
in 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified .    3.2598408163189445
in five preterm babies ( 28 % ) an acute UNK transfusion and in three newborns a UNK transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia .    3.4630832185651372
in two cases there was rh incompatibility , in two cases placental bleeding , and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia .    3.385360139796035
in one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause .    2.8932780758409127
another child suffered from ebv infection , and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations .    3.3766373181654945
ten children ( 55 % ) had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock .    3.5480988835983913
fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically .    3.274049533878559
seven children ( 39 % ) ; ( six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13 ) died between days 1 and 6 .    3.551752902556553
five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth .    3.1623225347782236
six children ( 33 % ) showed evidence of neurologic disease when discharged ; five of these were resuscitated previously .    3.387602315701
five children ( 28 % ) including three full - term babies were developed normally .    3.2114053739404893
in conclusion , severe anemia with hemoglobin below 10 g / dl is very rare but serious .    2.8847883286468723
it seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter .    3.0421758674009745
the prognosis can be influenced in a positive way .    3.4481248828747715
diagnosis of bacterial infection and / or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine .    3.554550939097672
white blood count , c - reactive protein ( crp ) , and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus sirs ( systemic inflammatory response syndrome ) due to UNK causes .    3.6019373351130834
there is a number of non - infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and crp elevation .    3.677478010686651
in the last 3 years , procalcitonin ( pct ) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection , especially sepsis .    3.3268831739679223
pct appears to have several advantages ; it is of non - hepatic ( yet unknown ) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency .    3.9083579881556507
there is no pct - increase in acute graft - rejection , viral disease , and autoimmune disorders .    3.019547791557198
some UNK showed a prognostic value of pct in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis .    3.0727518329622026
pct appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients .    2.959848100018429
further studies are needed to finally established pct in the daily management of critically ill patients .    2.576572930567654
at this time significantly higher costs are the major UNK to daily or frequent measurements .    2.9948687035455106
in this retrospective study , the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) tears is reported .    2.596911787039238
the acl injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy .    3.2593542330451486
treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and UNK .    4.110404983923528
the mean follow - up was 8 years .    2.938318223413468
twenty - nine ( 65 % ) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the acl injury during the follow - up period .    3.214283724130371
rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears .    4.07432312367822
the most common tear of the medial meniscus was the UNK - handle type , followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn .    3.988779619745505
secondary reconstruction of the acl was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way .    3.762663691571556
the remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the acl injury and a partial meniscectomy and acl reconstruction was performed .    3.1943792611706536
sixteen patients ( 35 % of the overall sample ) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow - up period , but discontinued their sporting activities .    3.4088288668823625
results indicate the increasing incidence of meniscal tears during acl insufficiency .    3.334439658331754
we recommend that patients with ruptures of the acl should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and UNK repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously .    3.836076785111087
four children , 4 to 10 years old , with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin a ( csa ; starting dosage 2 mg / kg per day ) and prednisolone .    3.5143931438358122
all children had previously received systemic steroids and / or cytotoxic agents , which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects .    3.212924565740429
in one child , suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved .    3.376170967881733
in a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function , although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage .    3.143298590338044
in the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation .    3.3838603973660253
during the time of treatment , ranging from 11 to 26 months , no serious side effects were observed .    3.5920879951425957
all patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia .    2.749959844091629
allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare .    3.057784142367017
in most cases the reactions are caused by different red UNK .    2.984624925213327
while in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts ( UNK ) and UNK UNK , now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions .    3.6734025295983783
a 42 - year - old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos .    2.7966170627203404
histologically a chronic granulomatous , partly fibrous inflammation with UNK elimination of pigment granules was found .    2.8778253501819417
spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed , simultaneously with UNK and scarring of the overlying skin .    3.9744533487756932
the pigment used for UNK was found to be an aromatic azo derivative .    4.298599787961357
in addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye , the patient also showed a positive patch test to UNK as , used for the coupling of different dyes in the UNK industry .    3.9876297439694075
borrelia burgdorferi specific dna has been detected by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) in different specimens of patients with lyme disease ( ld ) .    3.186506277930779
the aim of the present study is to evaluate pcr - diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of lyme disease .    2.5682930924642324
urine specimens of 77 patients ( ld , n = 34 ; undifferentiated arthritis ( ua ) , n = 25 ; arthralgia / UNK ( UNK ) , n = 18 ) and 15 controls were investigated .    3.5947796185576064
flagellin gene ( 60 specimens ) or ospa - plasmid ( 32 specimens ) were used as targets .    3.379844757589141
sensitivity of the flagellin - nested - pcr was 27 % , by ospa - nested - pcr only one positive pcr result was found .    2.8991729991617743
despite of low sensitivity pcr enabled the correct diagnosis of ld in two patients classified as ua .    3.211796854989239
therefore , pcr can give valuable hints in single cases if ld is clinically suspected .    2.8601496393169876
objective : to assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis .    3.471972869914734
methods : willow bark extract , in a dose corresponding to UNK UNK / day , was compared to placebo in a 2 - week , double - blind , randomized controlled trial .    3.4509523200529877
the primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the womac osteoarthritis index .    2.99395688014421
results : 78 patients ( 39 willow bark extract , 39 placebo ) participated in the trial .    2.8297044852760993
a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the womac pain dimension ( d = 6 . UNK , 95 % c . i . = 0 . 2 - 12 . UNK , p = 0 . 047 ) ; the womac pain score was reduced by 14 % from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment , compared to an increase of 2 % in the placebo group .    3.981866783602016
patient diary vas confirmed this result , and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo ( patients assessment , p = 0 . 0002 ; investigators assessment , p = 0 . UNK ) .    2.749727569768877
conclusion : willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis .    2.8908047136214523
background and methods : the aim of this study was to get more information about the prevalence of chronic pain in different practices of home physicians .    3.767388194433852
900 patients of five different specialists ( general medicine , internal medicine , neurology , orthopaedics , surgery ) in the german UNK bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain .    3.7476711746843336
chronic pain was defined as a continuous or UNK pain of longer duration than six months .    3.432818088523676
confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice .    3.2998202982003226
recently , new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope .    2.767774988444354
common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus , tonic body extension , UNK , UNK , eye deviations and hallucinations .    3.2849246666355576
thus , it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures .    2.6651399087035164
other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors , UNK symptoms and postictal events , such as tongue bites and postictal confusion , which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures .    3.124278566976285
in contrast , incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions .    2.940127323244698
investigations such as electroencephalogram , tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation .    2.7121252703350818
in rare cases , hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack .    2.846243478905353
in the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell .    3.3906861618873934
in the beginning , these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation .    2.8441381658641105
a series of important discoveries , initiated particularly by the UNK of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics , the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells , now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies .    3.302266050851832
in surgical oncology , these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences .    3.1913908539560047
basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed .    2.902447717122455
the compartment syndrome ( cs ) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space .    3.358846621343421
pathophysiologically , it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors .    3.9205399637944254
cofactors are , for instance , the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs .    4.300922262042776
in particular , the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction , development of a capillary leak , protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space .    3.1229118576122485
an impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction .    3.314353237286239
an arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the UNK pressure .    3.1410359248983304
an accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load .    3.1095672126456653
in disadvantageous cases , the patients are in danger of developing a multi - organ deficiency syndrome ( mods ) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction , by intravasal volume loss and by a UNK systemic reaction .    3.758721725242606
clinically , the patients suffer a UNK amount of pain , followed by neurological signs .    3.366058228806764
resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of UNK is important .    5.1817559885318305
in case of a manifest cs , UNK has to be performed as an emergency operation .    3.9541062732317798
even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early , the development of UNK cannot be avoided in every single case .    3.2841901997339917
the object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid - term and long - term follow - up .    2.9416510828576423
during the period from january 1980 to june 1997 we performed 247 open ( technique : 134 according to eden - hybbinette - lange , 46 according to weber , 26 according to putti - platt , 41 according to bankart ) and 76 arthroscopic ( UNK morgan technique ) shoulder stabilization procedures .    2.5706309587415714
we observed that the classic open bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation , range of motion , sports activity , and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures .    3.2177373248104764
the open bankart procedure UNK the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only .    3.891186165870652
the classic open bankart procedure seems to be the " gold standard " in open shoulder surgery today .    2.913179940927047
the high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more UNK patient selection in the future .    3.3453669572099365
background : our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2 % UNK and 0 , 5 % plain bupivacaine .    3.633672321208079
hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance .    4.246373701747494
when hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration , the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest .    3.8778570420855285
usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia .    3.2101603940863743
increasing age , diabetes mellitus , disorders of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone - system , high - dose antibiotics , and UNK treatments may result in hyperkalemia .    3.9425157822267285
the most important pathogenetic mechanisms are ( 1 ) renal insufficiency , ( 2 ) UNK UNK , ( 3 ) tubular disorders , and ( 4 ) cellular disorders .    4.1829963373029075
background : cmv retinitis is the most common opportunistic ocular infection and the main cause of blindness in aids patients with a t - helper cell count < = 50 / µl .    3.6131733333140774
cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half - life time after phosphorylation UNK .    3.186397206898033
it is effective against cmv and can be given intravenously and UNK .    3.462667612292049
the aim was to offer an alternative therapy for cmv retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it .    2.8715852903631576
the efficacy and tolerance of UNK injections of cidofovir should be evaluated .    2.9386931026838883
a case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported .    2.9594314391309937
one of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma , and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland .    2.993882071792865
the relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata , dermal cylindroma and multiple UNK is discussed .    2.934990457173884
in view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection , varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease .    3.4443010631938615
the initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease .    2.6484399445393563
the current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered .    2.9224941820260684
problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports .    3.0386316935306334
therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease - modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy .    3.8441108455788915
based on a broad variety of clinical studies , revealing more or less positive results , several combinations have been suggested : .    3.4995050390593336
the management of 178 patients with liver trauma ( 132 male , 46 female ; mean age 34 years ( range 3 - 88 ) presenting from january 1979 to august 1996 is reviewed .    3.0088422141479487
there were 165 cases of blunt trauma and 13 cases of penetrating injury .    2.9826693064060903
110 cases were classified as simple injuries ( grade i or ii ) and 68 cases as complex injuries ( grade iii to v ) .    3.521035993039463
the overall mortality was 32 % ( 57 patients ) .    2.959853017573717
the mortality for true hepatic injury was 15 . 7 % .    3.1457130540608693
none of the patients with penetrating injuries died .    3.2885181350954844
mortality was UNK by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries .    4.7833310977834795
the postoperative complication rate was 55 % .    3.3430961968798227
the most - frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or UNK hematoma ( 12 . 9 % ) and postoperative bleeding ( 9 . 6 % ) .    3.6340482873003164
intraabdominal abscess formation was seen in 2 . 8 % .    3.8626662989738096
operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury .    3.602365339104185
the majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques , including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents .    3.015513352747467
in complex injuries UNK , direct vessel ligation , and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice ( UNK ' s procedure ) .    3.5318870720133955
in non - controlled bleeding , UNK UNK is a standard method .    5.068596968909326
aim : the aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge , practices , and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the berlin dental association using a questionnaire .    2.670024298432214
the questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints .    3.917607950021802
results : of a total of UNK questionnaires sent , UNK were received for evaluation ( 12 . 1 % ) .    3.271260283305969
of respondents 9 . 5 % were regular smokers .    4.099551088817194
the median number of oral malignancies observed was 3 .    3.108127917755217
knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate .    3.0716313438283263
a total of 93 . 1 % of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions .    3.211967241238339
only 35 % take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26 . 6 % explain the side effects of tobacco .    3.7383918434557835
some 73 . 4 % believed that the dentist could play a role in anti - tobacco counselling .    2.9804020422062614
limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti - tobacco counselling .    2.9809469799718897
conclusions : this study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti - tobacco teaching material .    3.0088425559187506
since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti - tobacco counselling , adequate programmes in germany should be UNK and followed up .    3.278093165972054
background : last year ' s pilot study , which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with UNK disease , showed that in this UNK changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium .    4.2582581633510275
examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found .    3.952648840015282
the posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday .    3.5282998539083197
the authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation .    3.0301492316157512
in that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint .    3.0343858307419365
finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a UNK of the shoulder joint .    3.604944510708435
magnetic resonance tomography ( mrt ) has become the most important method in the workup of infantile cerebral complications after primary sonography .    3.1688119271867285
the choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain .    2.9489848825230984
a review of the main differential diagnoses is also given .    3.1528950351603924
the relevance of mr spectroscopy and fetal mri is discussed .    3.1177856547311165
currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors .    3.9185461836308306
one of them is the precise handling of optics .    2.881296248893565
up to now , in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder , stomach , large bowel and hernia operations .    2.974130722280801
the visual field is determined by the surgeon .    3.8043283920041424
in all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems .    2.8590398123870333
in 20 further cases there was one assistant .    3.56681403503499
a robot arm can be used successfully without problems by any laparoscopic surgeon in any operating UNK .    3.338263000223741
urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after UNK from cannabis use .    3.4920262284717833
urine samples ( n = 135 ) were investigated for free and conjugated 9 - UNK - 11 - nor tetrahydrocannabinol ( thccooh ) by lc / ms / ms and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) and 11 - hydroxy - thc ( 11 - oh - thc ) by gc / ms prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis .    3.2181519918585777
concentrations for free and conjugated thccooh were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine / dl urine .    3.4456666913734066
cannabis use was classified as light , moderate and heavy according to the current literature .    3.8935482859562685
in all groups chosen free and bound thccooh was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day .    3.396413981509973
urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of thccooh and thccooh glucuronide .    3.08415119781385
in frequent users , thc glucuronide and 11 - oh - thc glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence , respectively .    3.1575008136771485
in light users , neither thc glucuronide nor 11 - oh - thc glucuronide was detectable .    2.5579674655097766
the determination of conjugated thc and 11 - oh - thc in addition to free and bound thccooh is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use , but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption .    3.4781781299398444
the participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary , but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field .    3.533726764207698
the analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in UNK cases during an 11 - year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients .    3.537821553566526
interventions in younger patients , most of whom are suffering from psychoses , aim at rehabilitation through activity ; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders , the major concern is to improve UNK care ; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome .    3.2106770970977956
as far as their goals are comparable , social workers and doctors agree on their objectives .    3.073504002057657
social workers usually see their own interventions as successful , but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome .    2.9307596682293933
stiff - man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed UNK .    3.5079596460980818
the etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed .    3.2283638268798955
many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered .    3.465071857857273
a 22 year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff - man syndrome .    3.105735953282246
he has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk , starting in the neck .    3.262493435633207
massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed .    3.5557563947848894
clinical investigation , emg , cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal , thus excluding a stiff - man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases .    2.864746380978291
skin biopsy showed typical changes of buschke ' s scleredema adultorum , a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology .    2.538293527080144
therapy with UNK and UNK led to a mild improvement of symptoms .    4.218111249009457
although rare , buschke ' s scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome .    2.854747867172079
urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility .    3.288112734128534
various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies , facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues .    3.4022092469157386
valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections .    3.69773264044123
x - ray or ct images allow only a limited three - dimensional orientation in presurgical planning .    3.350993172224218
especially for the planning of internal UNK with custom - made endoprosthesis and for UNK osteotomies a high - grade orientation is necessary .    3.5014587412889524
this orientation is improved by a 3d ct - controlled manufactured 1 : 1 model of the pelvis .    3.593269978118341
this enables an exact classification of defect and deformity , planning of resection planes , design of the suitable custom - made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control .    3.049785015363987
an UNK - plug ( pda - plug ) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus .    2.9757190107708333
it can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8 - 16 french .    3.2748253576646524
the plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal ( aortal ) and two proximal ( pulmonary ) nitinol UNK .    3.225209275742326
in case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath .    3.0161629236812773
in animal experiments UNK of the implanted material was demonstrated .    4.21879648431099
during a follow - up of up to 24 months there were no complications .    3.594420157318617
using 8 different monoclonal antibodies , immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular , 34 papillary , 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid .    3.1793247968786535
the panel of antibodies was directed against broad - spectrum cytokeratins ( pan - ck , antibody UNK - 5 ) , against basic and acid high - molecular - weight ck of types 1 , 5 , 10 and 14 , against basic ( 5 and 6 ) and acid high - molecular - weight ck ( 13 ) and against basic ( 7 and 8 ) and acid low - molecular - weight ck ( 19 and 20 ) .    2.8870453057514878
with the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas , nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan - ck , ck 8 and ck 19 .    2.6636339300354557
ck 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas .    3.1526104324214566
reactivity for high - molecular - weight ck could only , each time focally , be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation .    3.0893132945778286
thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not UNK by any of the ck antibodies applied .    3.6122824252017893
ck 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers .    3.4844082448598956
in contrast , such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma , medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas .    3.163642667319686
these results confirm earlier studies in that ck 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad - spectrum ck antibodies .    2.9170136770595043
new is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non - papillary thyroid tumours regarding ck 7 expression .    3.0490302935079048
this result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern .    2.9625137514713873
purpose : to compare reading speed and reading comfort between closed - circuit television systems ( UNK ) with different image UNK rates .    3.095115479191673
this surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility .    3.3893791175272336
in detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described , as well as disorder - and event - specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children , UNK - UNK , and adolescents of the last 10 years .    3.7130785347244557
in addition , the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention .    2.8978639689159413
in recent years many different systems for transcatheter closure of an atrial septal defect ( asd ) have been developed and tested .    2.9788520571888424
however , all systems presently available have some special disadvantages .    2.9238455779881085
the recently introduced UNK septal occluder ( UNK ) , though , appears promising .    3.436593930905147
it is a self - expanding and self - UNK double disc made from a nitinol mesh , which is UNK woven to give mechanical strength .    3.322408747687476
both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion .    3.110209783347347
its diameter may be chosen , so that it corresponds to that of the asd .    3.44251055471771
in the light of recent research findings the UNK of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed .    3.116340498365328
they do not stand up to empirical UNK .    3.2718492822801193
this applies both to UNK models and to UNK of body and mind or of illness and health .    2.9028671724544663
the UNK - UNK view was replaced through a complex interplay of UNK somato - psychic circles which are to be integrated into a UNK model .    3.139228888987712
in terms of the self - object - body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function .    2.7903177637040346
the effects of the altered UNK positions on new therapy approaches are discussed .    2.7803881874590695
perioperative , mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations .    3.9391246991658853
herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease - causing microorganisms .    3.600045312685969
their prevalence can exceed 90 % depending on the socioeconomic status of the population .    3.3986206861312445
since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation , herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance .    3.900582188218032
while treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences .    2.9937026943694964
additionally , development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment .    3.287160626197727
we present a case history of a man with a b - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal UNK .    3.5188287736165136
possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of UNK and UNK as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed .    3.8543061151438898
tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for UNK .    3.08105548959061
despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during whipple ' s procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity , in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general .    3.3203270734329613
the problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein .    3.071028594524809
often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation .    2.7247909226391918
between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent whipple ' s procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department .    2.664654863665053
in eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion .    3.310518442973787
in all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with ct and UNK did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration .    3.414403058553277
in four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found .    3.2332669476774734
in the others we found no or only adventitial tumor invasion .    3.3839555878878054
the patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27 . 78 months in contrast to 6 . 67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration .    3.543061939470553
endovascular , UNK ultrasound ( ipeus ) , a new diagnostic procedure , can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement .    3.7259998752783616
although the ipeus is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity .    3.412367299210998
our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by ipeus , patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection .    3.024096855713376
progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies .    2.9937606298697195
this does also apply for stroke treatment : new pathophysiological knowledge , positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the UNK importance of early treatment at stroke units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency .    3.5254828534758076
timing is of utmost importance .    3.343982403105402
time - based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy .    3.186039466750877
the treatment process is divided into three phases : alarming , pre - hospital and in - hospital phase .    3.398841973409396
the effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables ( personnel , technical equipment , course of the disease , etc . ) .    3.283082024013367
knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses , which allows an aimed improvement , e . g .    2.741943337179853
public education , training of paramedics and medical personnel .    3.450746766357923
prosthetic valve endocarditis ( pve ) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement .    3.7296240422182416
incidence ranges in literature between 0 . 1 % and 2 . 3 % ( mean 0 . 4 % ) per patient year ( UNK ) .    4.074684015217376
pve is classified as " early " or " late " ( occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement ) .    3.2675445640045138
in this review we present the clinical outcome of pve as well as the most common diagnostic criteria ( UNK criteria ) , the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria .    4.618317090574584
the spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards .    3.831410714023123
recently intra - atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation .    3.500724913810261
low - energy intra - atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus UNK f . ex .    3.384101720006344
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided .    3.102014002822762
additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation .    4.19829612482404
intra - atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method , but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far .    3.442806532921354
especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy .    2.933658799321704
modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures .    3.1546177880891833
the aim is three - dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures .    3.608081461032314
in this paper , we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation .    3.1575869798474208
hereby , the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined .    3.5173008177388136
precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite .    5.054427433074421
the immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm .    3.5532267823378865
this method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy .    3.778403201330962
this indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method .    3.5232655852851105
the integration of functional image information , such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas , will be evaluated in the future .    3.443318324240613
olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome ( ips ) .    3.657566982515522
in contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of ips , clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed .    3.2604233352961676
this may be due to the lack of an easy - to - use , inexpensive , standardized , and reliable test .    3.601381217533506
in this study , we administered the newly developed " UNK ' UNK " test to a group of 40 UNK ips patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age , gender , and smoking habits .    3.351995811623463
in all three UNK including odor identification , odor detection threshold , and odor discrimination , the control group scored significantly better than the ips group , yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90 % each .    3.102121551884467
our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in ips can be found at early stages of the disease , appear bilaterally , and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism .    3.0114168650615127
therefore , we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of ips .    3.4169964696593143
purpose : the goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional mri to establish computer - based , preoperative therapy planning for tumors , UNK cervical carcinoma .    3.472014260758553
drug - induced toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology .    3.7092114432721894
toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes .    3.5375950161823453
for this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years .    2.850387509361719
results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable , as exemplified with two patients described here who UNK from the procedure despite their old age .    3.4947424598058343
in order to gain insight into possible disease mechanisms that would explain the beneficial effect of plasmapheresis , we did immunohistochemical studies on these patients before and in one case after the procedure .    3.1715741275797305
in dermis and epidermis , there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of cd8 - positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells ; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction .    3.266394138210216
on the basis of the clinical results , the pathogenetic considerations , and in view of the lack of specific treatment modalities , clinical studies concerning plasmapheresis for the treatment of toxic epidermal necrolysis are recommended , particularly since this procedure is widely available and generally well tolerated .    3.7646144261117636
the majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery .    2.9823362497855292
in problematic cases , however , optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved .    3.485779954010372
in these cases , external frontal sinus surgery is indicated .    2.975295934202001
impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation .    3.162468147736267
its problematic nature is UNK on a report of two cases , one with a UNK nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail .    3.9759340705213573
this event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively .    3.323966345351966
the new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to UNK against the cortex .    3.5052179481070476
their UNK benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful .    3.1882104341049704
primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases .    3.3879210698137854
adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate .    3.3968424309150125
we present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of - hcg in csf .    2.7948101902045077
six years before , a UNK of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy .    3.651206571992143
this demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline - sized brain - tumors by evaluation of - hcg and afp in csf and serum .    3.4007993536560304
today , different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy .    3.5508333111458454
however , the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial .    3.0086274507699327
recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting cns germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high - dose polychemotherapy , surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area .    3.7773062911507003
- hcg and afp may serve as useful markers to enable follow - up of the disease .    2.8904709401877637
in order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since 1 . 1 . 1997 .    3.2116777208525096
the orthopedic university clinic of heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients .    2.9748714314215747
according to a standardized nomenclature all occured complications the doctors put in the data of complications in a database .    3.2712079124064406
these data were controlled , complemented and classified by members of the quality UNK group .    3.1695731047985682
this guideline consists of five parts : catalogue of diagnoses , general and special definitions , classification and an allocation table of diagnoses to grades of severity .    2.935366264915286
the internet plays an important role in a growing number of medical applications .    3.4060697098581625
finding relevant information is not always easy as the amount of available information on the web is rising quickly .    3.795104693131315
even the best search UNK can only collect links to a fraction of all existing web UNK .    2.979429664859975
in addition , many of these UNK documents have been changed or deleted .    3.0413625864388605
the vast majority of information on the web is not UNK with conventional methods .    3.2208973431766075
new search strategies , technologies and standards are combined in intelligent search agents ( UNK ) and robots , which can retrieve desired information in a specific approach .    3.5306554569118136
with the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) , and transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) , diagnostic options in the evaluation of marfan patients have been improved profoundly .    3.1716037592711808
the most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall , immunofluorescence studies or pulse UNK analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts , and molecular analysis at the cdna / dna level of the UNK - 1 gene .    3.3009027317781294
new diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised UNK criteria for the diagnosis of marfan syndrome .    3.240194290760791
the diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed : moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence , UNK as well as in the pre - and postoperative patient .    4.043791178539511
primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias , dysostoses and dysplasias .    2.949162761197068
hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal .    3.4432076844793773
generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and UNK - turner syndrome .    3.068942240293575
dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis .    3.1828638189209935
many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences .    3.145890662365345
dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue .    3.5763025263293593
some of them ( e . g . UNK , UNK type of metaphyseal UNK ) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation .    3.5215857353170414
others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components .    2.9226768702491293
examples are UNK such as osteogenesis UNK and some UNK dysplasias .    3.295275907092272
finally , disorders such as UNK , result from defects of UNK - osseous homeostasis .    3.765289392100094
the study of skeletal defects helps to UNK the complexity of normal skeletal development .    3.5960302035938105
human parvovirus b19 causes erythema UNK ( fifth disease ) and UNK crisis .    3.5804287700732402
in pregnancy , b19 may be transmitted on to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis .    3.1556949721217302
b19 is sometimes associated with thrombocytopenia and vasculitis .    3.1125916011718884
in immunocompromised patients , b19 may persist causing chronic infection .    3.074457427790451
several methods for detecting b19 virus or specific antibodies are now available .    3.047390121889431
b19 infection does not usually require therapy .    3.232300229596891
efficacy of immunoglobulins in chronic b19 infection has been demonstrated .    3.5036517623534347
in absence of significant symptoms and signs , the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ( pe ) remains difficult .    3.718148584051532
sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests , chest x - ray , and ecg on their own is low .    3.2589277538134027
echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload .    3.249416083490799
venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected pe , but normal results do not rule out pe .    3.600026014702063
helical ct with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli .    3.514056103631679
however , if the ct findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion , only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out , and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed .    3.264002042597893
the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment , several diagnostic techniques , and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases .    3.1808005579596683
heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics .    4.36373646915537
thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients .    3.9104753105498364
in short - term dose regimes , the thrombolytic agents urokinase , streptokinase , and rt - pa seem to be equally efficient .    3.4884917763837744
so far , however , no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism .    3.3999718385704725
we therefore evaluated mesopic vision in myopic eyes before and after lasik .    3.1428829200699755
renal tubular UNK is a rarely recognized condition characterized by UNK , UNK ' s sequence and congenital anuria leading to UNK or neonatal death from respiratory failure .    4.057927357348385
it is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner .    2.865245763054774
definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology , revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation .    4.0609978621372775
two additional cases of affected UNK in a family with parental consanguinity are reported .    3.638098026802412
UNK and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule .    3.464136965428029
further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis .    3.056785115582151
the clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed .    3.168507708695852
articular cartilage has only a small capacity for UNK .    3.677267807337366
this makes the repair of articular surfaces difficult .    3.207430766710461
in UNK pridie described his method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints .    2.7933840104469874
this operation is still in widespread use today .    3.4413134452078538
pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro - cartilaginous repair .    3.3497390886489713
the newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms .    3.048552544610106
bone drilling into the subchondral layer is also effective in promoting healing of osteochondrosis dissecans .    2.9692239280863433
the choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient , UNK of symptoms , activity level and functional demands on the joint , site and stage of the lesion .    4.4210791562387755
the drilling operation remains useful in UNK and osteochondrosis dissecans .    3.5430354505930652
recent immunobiological findings together with advances in UNK , UNK in clinical trial design , and mri developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .    3.653265889529757
however , in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments , a number of therapeutical failures exist as well : despite impressive data from animal models , convincing concepts , and promising phase i / ii studies , some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials , or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects .    3.1971008563566476
this article provides an overview of clinical studies that have failed or been abandoned for other reasons .    3.266393364882652
tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies ( UNK , UNK ) are discussed in detail .    4.006945112503339
these results raise critical questions concerning the hypothetical pathogenesis of ms lesions and the value of mri in the assessment of clinically relevant therapeutic drug effects .    3.297427811303303
in addition to a description of the immunobiological background , studies on the immunosuppressive agents UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK , trials for the cytokines interleukin - 10 and tgf - 2 , the studies on UNK by intravenous immunoglobulins ( ivig ) , oral tolerance , and extracorporeal UNK are discussed .    3.305548795622641
isolated pancreatic metastases from renal - cell carcinomas ( rcc ) are extremely rare .    3.011393884327649
only 96 cases of clinically diagnosed renal - cell carcinoma metastatic to the pancreas have been reported in the world literature , and 70 of the patients ( including UNK ) underwent a definitive surgical resection .    3.777983197597353
in many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of UNK metastases is reported to exceed 10 years .    3.312910408642042
therefore , the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease - free interval .    3.7063547675416157
when it does occur simultaneously or UNK , aggressive surgical resection , when possible , seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion .    3.5895020220376286
surgical resection can provide long - term survival in selected cases .    3.184203927004572
we present the case of a 69 - year - old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left - sided subtotal UNK with splenectomy , 12 years after radical nephrectomy for a rcc .    3.0522742261921465
the patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right - sided colon cancer .    3.334547033984218
thus , the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially .    3.523782577022287
both tumors were UNK resected , and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous rcc .    3.6224953214736377
in the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to rcc .    2.929418966154928
it illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis .    3.2272604375240124
the need for prolonged follow - up of patients is emphasized .    3.6241376708622695
the few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from rcc are reviewed after the presentation of this case .    3.443552088656827
delusion is understood to mean UNK disconcerting UNK with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder .    3.323254740477619
the perceptions from which UNK arise are dynamically UNK according to their role in the structural context .    3.7921399157734337
the failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic UNK of the structure is also a requirement .    4.0905433861712535
based on a case study , considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification .    3.689002607199841
high - dose chemotherapy ( hdct ) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis .    3.556308934508221
the selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist , as the indication has to be carefully established .    3.7181146354594987
exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions .    3.286129794514763
prior to hdct haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional - dose chemotherapy plus g - or gm - csf stimulation .    3.180353651074018
hdct consists of a combination of carboplatin , etoposide and UNK or cyclophosphamide .    4.138523424541162
after hdct , UNK monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential .    3.122640721800092
it is therefore recommended that hdct only be administered at specialized centres .    2.7900766860917994
pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years .    3.596852052823501
it usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease .    3.3231171342992813
several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described .    2.804247207988504
extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly .    3.1383143352846217
malignant pyoderma , the variant described in our case report , is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum , rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease .    3.277553186202141
the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist .    3.210246463470502
histopathologic findings , however , always include vasculitis , either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis ( 7 ) , granulomatous ( 1 ) or lymphocytic vasculitis ( 2 ) .    3.796235125535192
we report on a 36 - year - old male patient , who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch .    3.2666213418295755
the aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit .    3.2499522427825345
an association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously , but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing UNK of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum .    3.9331230403387956
we could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine    3.268420582382349
background and purpose : to test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts .    2.8376882497377247
defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit .    3.799463979713445
for the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko - ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the UNK loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency .    3.03275539576326
the main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko - ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures .    3.370777175739174
with a transpedicular screw - UNK - system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished .    3.297776501955934
after rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure .    2.9972828264883167
analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented .    3.5771217572616436
in 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed , in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r - tpa .    2.937230853112189
in 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and UNK .    3.05610484905577
a stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep - seated lesions was performed in 6 cases .    3.5138855091963492
the accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88 . 7 % in our series , in accordance to other authors .    3.4535729669079718
the stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics .    3.064215490486356
the stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal UNK and low operative risk .    3.7302168874133366
the aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r - tpa or urokinase .    2.7882811294531895
with stereotactic guidance small , deep - seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed .    3.015636495081396
radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages ( t1 - t2 ) .    4.035470122632157
in locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality .    3.054125024174354
recent developments in linear UNK technique , the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time .    2.892082755187014
the combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone .    3.526428482112231
in special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated .    3.907519700322978
future developments ( i . e . intensity modulated radiotherapy - UNK , combined thermo - radiotherapy , proton - or UNK ) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer .    4.092853677322403
the significance of cutaneous b - cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years .    3.2917835269857987
the most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas , marginal zone b - cell lymphomas , and diffuse large b - cell lymphomas .    2.6922076519077405
the majority of primary cutaneous b - cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis .    3.0333756561315153
whereas in b - cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma .    3.773265668210497
it is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph - node - based UNK .    2.9329651900196674
in the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous b - cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous b - cell lymphomas is discussed according to the who classification UNK .    2.986674007065328
the UNK derivative ketamine is a non - competitive n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor antagonist with the thalamo - UNK projection system as the primary site of action .    2.832710469707881
racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers s ( + ) - ketamine and r ( - ) - ketamine .    2.7387522480563047
racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism ( cmro2 ) and increases cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) and intracranial pressure ( icp ) .    2.6059555021015623
however , recent experiments suggest that both UNK ketamine and s ( + ) - ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury .    2.96508971761304
this experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in ca + influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to nmda and UNK receptor blockade by ketamine .    3.1905729506700053
studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg ) increases cbf in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator n2o .    2.9031877306109215
in contrast , studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in cbf after racemic ketamine ( 100 mg / kg i . p . ) .    2.508158262812446
this suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre - existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics .    2.1023257409060214
cerebrovascular co2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance .    3.3874730694210564
there are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase cbf .    2.9043902874647856
this produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular co2 reactivity .    3.813346858211395
racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation , which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic , extrapyramidal , auditory , and sensory - motor systems .    2.923826335865461
this regional neuroexcitation with increased cmro2 produces increases in cbf that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines .    3.176282570814262
however , increases in cbf with racemic ketamine ( 1 mg / kg ) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in cmro2 .    3.343677475886222
this effect is related to some additional direct cerebral UNK potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of ca + channels .    3.3149688840384943
the effects of racemic ketamine on cbf autoregulation have not been investigated systematically .    2.9345968243994833
however , studies in rats have shown that cbf autoregulation was maintained with low - and high - dose s ( + ) - ketamine .    3.3239726191048597
infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and icp .    3.2231295512170743
studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine ( 0 . 5 - 5 . 0 mg / kg ) produces increases in paco2 and icp .    3.2995642986633356
in contrast , identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled paco2 showed no changes in icp following racemic ketamine infusion .    2.7815636400931387
this implies that increases in icp are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume .    2.9840715573402568
however , mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control icp following racemic ketamine .    3.200762237752787
studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg ) reduces cbf in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or n2o .    3.0542712463607518
in contrast , studies in UNK humans showed increases in cbf after racemic ketamine ( 2 - 3 mg / kg ) .    2.5883637290359007
this observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre - existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics .    2.2502458204313465
UNK - fever is a UNK transmitted viral disease .    3.561889510799562
it is endemic mainly in south - east asia and UNK .    2.7378865885527452
ocular manifestations in UNK have been rarely reported .    3.8187557208561267
multiple factors may cause tear film instability .    3.2415341391779426
measuring the break - up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary , clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability .    3.145753296429506
we designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break - up phenomena .    3.1189460870643773
the prevalence of hepatitis b , hepatitis c and hiv infections among drug abuse - related fatalities in hamburg ( 1985 - 1997 ) was investigated with respect to epidemiological , forensic and morphological aspects .    2.786436251362389
the purpose of this study was ( 1 ) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis b ( hbv ) , hepatitis c ( hcv ) and hiv infections among drug abuse - related fatalities ( drug deaths ) in hamburg from 1985 to 1997 , ( 2 ) to assess the rate of multiple infections and ( 3 ) to analyze the liver UNK in 100 autopsied drug deaths .    3.2288538377415845
furthermore , we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects .    3.149975013953225
in this period UNK drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for hbv of 35 % ( 1997 : 39 % ) , for hcv 51 % ( 1997 : 58 % ) , and for hiv 7 % ( 1997 : 15 % ) .    3.631963423186608
co - infections were common ( 28 % ) and 19 % of all cases were infected with hbv and hcv .    4.135259315626643
the liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed ( 74 % ) and was associated with hbv and / or hcv infections ( 77 % of all hepatitis cases ) .    3.867991000085802
only 9 % showed a normal UNK .    3.4121777194129517
forensic autopsies and monitoring of hbv , hcv and hiv infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i . v .    3.5192216589457828
background : an abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia .    3.3749331794878974
our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina , only moderately elevated ldl - cholesterol levels ( 168 + / - 33 mg / dl ) , and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal ( n = 9 ) or slightly abnormal ( n = 9 ) coronary UNK ( minimal disease with luminal irregularities and / or diameter reduction < = 30 % ) before and after 6 - month lipid - lowering therapy ( UNK ) .    3.4958471557872692
methods : regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation ( 0 . 56 mg / kg ) using dynamic positron emission tomography ( pet ) and n - 13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3 - compartment kinetic model .    3.132024553934348
baseline data ( mean + / - sd ) : 13 males , 5 females ; mean age : 56 + / - 8 years ; basal coronary flow : 90 + / - 22 ml / minx100 g ; after lipid intervention : 93 + / - 18 ml / minx100 g ( n . s . ) .    3.306026708511453
total cholesterol decreased to 170 + / - 36 mg / dl ( p < 0 . 001 ) ; mean ldl level : 97 + / - 26 mg / dl ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    2.9361785882795255
concomitantly , a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients .    3.3205515085380477
conclusions : an improvement of the non - invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis .    3.311795006459175
consequently , aggressive cholesterol - lowering therapy represents an antiischemic and UNK approach suggesting , at least in part , functional reversal and probably prevention of further disease progression .    2.807340625657136
we report the case of a a 60 year - old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis .    3.02826122790496
initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands ; later on it became generalized .    3.1542358357334956
the patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years .    2.971359359895472
eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2 , 6 - diaminopyridine ( patch test positive ) ; this healed upon cessation of exposure .    2.813703340539671
ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis .    2.8834523034148254
under systemic and local therapy with corticosteroids and cessation of work , it healed nearly completly .    3.0088162786217727
four months after returning to work , the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before .    3.3424012776525807
his condition continued to UNK , when though the patient was transferred at work and now UNK rubber gloves .    3.6672073264669645
eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis .    3.2202448193519095
patch testing revealed delayed - type UNK to hydroxychloroquine ( tested in concentrations of 0 . 1 % , 0 . 5 % , 1 % and 2 % ) .    4.007374494451624
equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative .    3.4360112833941487
the patch test reactions were pustular , while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction .    2.961592472690074
bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours , which progressed to fever and generalized erythema ( hematogenous contact dermatitis ) .    3.00800060146879
after removing exposure to 2 , 6 - diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine , the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex ( patch test positive ) .    3.2275105364793473
however , skin prick tests with latex and patch tests with rubber UNK were negative .    2.9554566435952143
hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions .    4.205673216036624
to our knowledge , contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported .    2.832952199323966
it is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction .    2.5458851042771706
pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed - type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin , cobalt and nickel induced asthma .    3.1674080361153334
a 45 years old female UNK developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin .    3.1297672674202732
one month later the right achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain .    3.0721435717016847
mri revealed degenerative changes of the left achilles tendon ; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon .    3.755833111414477
the tendon was reconstructed surgically .    3.4394639908692923
the histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis .    2.98798133213296
this finding differ from findings in non drug induced UNK .    2.9748902649023843
after antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered .    3.135137040570472
the impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms .    3.4591507273288973
the recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors .    3.5681996977654666
several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer .    4.047572338121366
in many cases , the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor - suppressor genes is the predominant reason for UNK cell transformation .    3.2123230481100324
functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations , resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the dna .    4.066959437510019
as our understanding of the nature , function , and interaction of these genes UNK , new opportunities for early diagnosis , classification , prevention , and treatment of malignant tumors will arise .    3.829733654935296
the present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes ( UNK , ras , myc , UNK , fos , jun , bcl , mdm 2 , UNK , kit UNK , met ) and tumor suppressor genes ( p 53 , UNK , mts ) involved in lung - cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors , including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned .    3.857435051228603
hyperbaric oxygen ( hbo ) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient UNK 100 % of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure .    3.6093500136745655
it is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological UNK .    2.8697978398413695
for the clinical use of hbo therapy , according to international recommendations , there are several commonly accepted indications in which hbo either is the only causative life - saving kind of treatment , or is an essential and UNK decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy .    3.3540019250163717
among potential adverse effects , UNK of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned .    4.458208005448114
clinical use of hbo therefore requires special knowledge of its effects , risks , and adverse effects , a clear and distinct indication , and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures .    3.7100252575383763
the clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary - like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional , most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist .    3.1506407999756707
although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established , there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment .    3.5380048455857875
in order to UNK analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures , we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before orif .    2.8496257144540653
there were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47 . 8 years ( 16 - 88 years ) .    3.379505075027749
there were more cartilage lesions found than expected , and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type c - fractures than in type b - fractures .    3.3122056534995834
in both fracture types , an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3 .    3.607960423223609
in addition , more ligament injuries were found than expected , especially in the b . 1 - and b . 2 - fractures .    3.927679204508622
successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases : internal fixation , 9 ; loose body removal , 7 ; ligament reposition , 5 ; cartilage UNK , 4 ; and cartilage fracture repair , 1 .    3.6400767958659697
in one case , a UNK flap could not be reduced , and in another case , the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable .    3.772151809294753
in summary , arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures .    3.239827632979228
as long - term results are not yet available , it remains , however , unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following orif .    4.349140411708073
arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures .    3.4133237084602177
of these , percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication .    3.2859261623176472
objective : UNK adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis , the bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index ( basfi ) and UNK functional index ( d - fi ) .    3.2018291918232347
methods : the instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency ( cronbach ' s coefficient alpha ) , test - retest reliability ( UNK correlation coefficient , icc ) , construct validity ( testing for association with UNK ' s test , finger floor distance , occiput wall distance , frequency and duration of awakenings at night , and a visual analog scale pain ) , and responsiveness ( standardized response mean , srm ) .    2.912475064551852
results : the study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized , controlled clinical trial receiving either diclofenac or placebo .    3.1404314728824954
the limited responsiveness to diclofenac treatment ( srm : 0 . 46 [ basfi ] , 0 . 33 [ d - fi ] ) may be related to the selected study sample .    3.3822190640652683
the basfi was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters .    3.3015042487206823
the d - fi was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance , occiput wall distance , and duration of awakenings at night .    2.5926250985840156
conclusion : the UNK adapted version of both functional indices are valid , reliable , and internally consistent .    2.8817745899883205
because of psychometric advantages , the basfi may be preferred in clinical trial settings .    3.2040900661026126
the role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain .    3.537858794576001
interpretation of the few prospective studies ( UNK 75 - 06 and 77 - 06 ) is hampered by severe UNK in the study design .    3.926430548913818
extension of the radiation to the paraaortal region shows no advantage over radiation of the pelvic lymphatics alone and is not warranted .    3.4605050442015046
data on longterm side - effects are only available from older studies with UNK radiation techniques .    3.282139776610252
according to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone .    3.459967418325164
in summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies .    3.613283039704342
in reconstruction of cartilage defects , autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method .    3.470744032455274
although a clinical application has not been reported until now , tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants .    3.2683339255158006
nevertheless , in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms .    3.0130491193399354
among other methods for in vivo tissue protection , the encapsulation with a UNK polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences .    3.197119015050392
human septal cartilage was encapsulated ( group 1 ) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of UNK nude mice .    3.10055871180254
cartilage implants without encapsulation ( group 2 ) were used as control .    3.492287682577613
scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 weeks after implantation .    3.5381298527056857
group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all .    3.377573056060085
in contrast , group 2 presented , correlating to the time of UNK - tion , increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation , representing an increased activity of resorption .    3.4250276863200733
in conclusion , tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences .    2.665921625539791
for the plastic - reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable .    2.9253826803013965
subjective time - experience and objective time - estimation were examined in 20 endogenous , 20 neurotic depressives , and 15 healthy volunteers .    3.348328544512021
subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls .    2.8634107939359636
objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives .    2.8691477649710064
there were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives .    2.4682076625250127
the perception of extended time normalized during treatment .    3.273857039791753
the depressives ' time perception , differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation .    3.374306673825265
the findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives .    2.753217857573527
amelioration of experienced time - extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of UNK .    2.8562191820356233
we investigated whether the free - to - total prostate - specific antigen ( psa ) ratio ( f - psa / t - psa ratio ; i . e . percentage of free psa ) represents a better UNK for the detection of cancer of the prostate ( cap ) .    3.5253308404518933
in a retrospective analysis , the UNK of free psa was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) and 35 patients with clinically localized cap .    3.4968776699516204
patients with urolithiasis ( n = 33 ) served as a control group .    3.5433925990780155
serum levels of free psa and total psa were determined employing a UNK enzyme immunoassay .    3.3420286039768663
patients with cap demonstrated a lower percentage of free psa ( median : 8 . 7 ) than patients with bph ( median : 20 . 0 ; p < 0 . 001 ) and those with urolithiasis ( median : 18 . 8 ; p < 0 . 001 ) .    3.188918335385365
determination of the percentage of free psa enhances the differentiation between bph and cap and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated psa .    3.9898320628712822
confirmation of our preliminary results is required .    3.336361190811915
psychological problems in children and parents related to children ' s atopic eczema ( UNK ) may impede the success of treatment .    3.975543257279746
we studied the question , if behavior - based parental education in groups ( UNK ) or standardized video - education ( UNK ) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin - damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers .    3.7074608428156948
sevoflurane UNK in co2 absorbents to produce compound a , which may have hepatotoxic potential in humans .    3.35715922174228
several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential .    3.8384846115632922
three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3 % concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 l / min flow rate .    3.1739491218401716
subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers .    2.9056611536159527
one additional investigation in volunteers studied 3 % sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low - flow ( 1 l / min ) technique .    3.573946515650815
no significant excretion of protein , glucose or renal enzymes was observed .    2.8499754562558026
application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration .    3.800416447697318
although some controversy remains , these data , combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients , suggest that renal function following modest duration low - flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia .    3.426122610691188
background : the microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery .    2.5807487542936367
streptococci and UNK coli pave the way for the UNK dominance typical in breast - fed newborns .    3.3588431934899012
they provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen .    2.8643451876930146
a mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant .    2.992375123872913
bifidobacteria , UNK , UNK , streptococci and UNK are the main UNK of this mixed intestinal flora .    4.808192388548879
this represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults .    3.3559264878198536
bifidus - enhancing factors in breast - feeding are UNK , UNK , glycoproteins such as UNK and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother .    4.255584932874762
factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies , lactoferrin , lysozyme , fatty acids and UNK that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers ' milk .    2.8822394949777266
a bifidus - inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth - canal infections , which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births .    3.304095189430918
an increasing number of surgical deliveries , the separation of the newborn infant from its mother , and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life - threatening nosocomial infections .    4.031393335832937
UNK measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria - preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria .    2.9408114469731266
between january 1983 and december 1987 , metatarsal head - resections were performed on 203 patients , comprising a total of UNK feet , using the UNK / mayo and hoffmann procedure .    3.189380727795164
seventy - two patients , comprising a total of 126 feet , were available for post - operative review after an average of 11 . 4 years from the date of the original operations .    3.71918796740977
the information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient ' s file .    4.323501279024417
in addition , every available pre - and post - operative x - ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed .    2.9087953357650282
thus , with an average follow - up period of 5 . 6 years , the changes found in the pre - and post - operative x - rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared .    3.823475498188316
before the operations , nearly 100 % of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation , causing approximately 70 % of all patients to have great difficulties in walking .    3.2054416518034676
after the operations , however , 90 . 2 % of the patients reported that this condition had UNK improved or had completely disappeared .    4.047387424827668
in fact , 87 . 5 % of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances .    3.2927179442013217
as the main criteria in determining the success of an operation ( namely , the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility ) were achieved in 87 . 5 % of the patients , we consider the metatarsal head - resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis .    3.530200524396695
bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting UNK .    3.5958472538208635
bone morphogenetic proteins ( bmps ) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation .    3.2841349683142047
within this study , we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation - and differentiation rate of osteoblast - like cells .    3.17820850893604
for that purpose , human osteoblast - like cells ( hpoc ) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant bmp - 4 of the genome of xenopus laevis ( rxbmp - 4 ) , recombinant human bmp 2 ( rhbmp - 2 ) , transforming growth factor - ß ( tgf - ß ) or basic fibroblast growth factor ( rh - bfgf ) in two different concentrations each ( 10 ng / ml and 50 ng / ml ) .    2.739294307126972
cell proliferation was measured within a mtt [ 3 - ( 4 , 5 - UNK - 2 - UNK ) - 2 , 5 - UNK UNK ] assay , the amount of cell differentiation by the activity of UNK phosphatase .    4.857153176218187
however , rh - bfgf provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with UNK hpoc , while rhbmp - 2 and rxbmp - 4 showed no effect on proliferation .    3.2882696169257457
tgf - ß influenced bone proliferation as well as UNK significantly .    3.65280293717029
the equipotent effect of recombinant human bmp - 2 and recombinant bmp - 4 obtained from xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast - like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for bmp 2 as well as bmp 4 , or that both bmp ' s link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity .    3.232024687545006
sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region .    3.6148854208262176
due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the UNK of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone .    3.6028253049833867
ultrasound has replaced the UNK procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications .    3.8008381721385263
after inauguration of color doppler sonography non - invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible .    3.249352353289304
this issue is important for the differential UNK of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss , vertigo and tinnitus .    3.304174718297939
additionally , the extent of perfusion of space - occupying lesions can be easily examined , and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient .    3.640576440991854
especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion .    3.3064243779122995
in several studies the specificity of the assessment of cervical lymph node disease could be increased by examination of resistance indices .    3.640734604028358
however , other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant UNK ; therefore , final judgment does not seem to be possible yet .    3.2241788628109935
use of echo - contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color doppler imaging .    3.181340967572088
painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill - defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat .    3.874337582283736
the nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder , adhesive UNK , focal UNK , stiff shoulder , contracted shoulder , and others .    2.8368509077408652
apart from its idiopathic form , the disease can be initiated by trauma , infection , tumour , radiation , systemic and local metabolic disturbances .    3.4456471672737146
UNK , the common UNK is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening , scarring , and retraction of the joint capsule .    3.2371138708587215
the prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) is not treated is unfavorable , with a reported 5 - year survival of 0 - 18 % .    3.704182345337999
retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis .    3.5536961394851465
some patients will benefit from resection of metastases , but most patients with metastatic rcc are not candidates for such aggressive surgery .    3.19611878239157
the use of interleukin - 2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions .    3.1614416363484814
without randomized trials , it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients , but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long - lasting remissions in selected patients .    3.5905512619951936
many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit - to - risk ratio of immunotherapy , but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic rcc .    3.882984590234924
after loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired .    3.112643013185041
fusion of the glenohumeral joint creates a new platform for the movement of elbow , hand and fingers and leads to an improvement of function .    3.2463901286069285
the use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier .    2.8564018401590188
shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is UNK active .    3.698524420628102
but fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered .    2.9607846010191703
the unreamed femoral nail ( ufn ) system , with its numerous proximal interlocking options , allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns .    3.4480523337202764
sixty - six fractures , 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures , 2 limb UNK and 1 lengthening ( UNK technique ) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the ufn from july 1994 to december 1996 .    3.003402341132794
the fractures were analysed according to the ao classification .    3.0280820116059237
we found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean iss of 21 . 8 and a mean pts of 25 . 4 .    3.766804244160889
most of the multiply injured patients ( n = 26 ) were stabilised with the ufn primarily .    3.0664419392613573
follow - up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively .    3.1581120939677287
according to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases , good in 36 . 3 % , poor in 20 . 4 % and bad in 9 % .    4.019832994785027
average fracture healing time was about 9 . 8 weeks .    3.7734107403592345
fractures of the atlas account for 1 - 2 % of all vertebral fractures .    4.275087912036489
we divide atlas fractures into 5 groups : isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas , isolated fractures of the posterior arch , combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch ( so - called jefferson fractures ) , isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process .    3.6562583767339167
isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared .    3.2773639351149484
jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament .    3.7203692501456787
stable jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto - axial or occipito - axial stabilization and fusion .    3.071728936213684
the authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation c1 / c2 according to magerl .    3.0006192970779693
this has the advantage of saving the atlanto - occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or UNK cast UNK .    2.8501639543973845
in late instabilities c1 / 2 with UNK of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment , an occipito - cervical fusion is indicated .    3.4636704121747695
isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may , if the lateral mass is totally destroyed , be a reason for an occipito - cervical fusion .    3.2167538366063075
fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery .    3.8272764426280457
no treatment is necessary for the fracture itself .    3.7614940128538215
reported is the case of a 36 - year - old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery .    3.3967120185259754
histologically and immunohistochemically , no hints on UNK as a possible cause of bleeding were detected .    3.2856242233239605
considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture , a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the UNK UNK UNK was most probably the reason for bleeding .    4.734608342195098
we report on a 2 - year - old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood ( cbdc ) .    2.6632821443124133
following antibiotic treatment with UNK p . o .    3.6126322662535038
she developed typical symptoms of cbdc , i . e .    2.755733416923826
tense blisters on erythematous skin in the perineal area , on the flexor aspects of the thighs and upper arms and on the face .    3.593436588153259
direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear iga deposition along the basement membrane zone , confirming the diagnosis of cbdc .    3.0756241490642493
these lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p . o .    3.187846694606676
this case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis , clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood .    3.626174733348796
systemic administration of strontium - 89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases .    3.4336594276285304
recently , rhenium - 186 - hedp was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages ( shorter physical half - life , scintigraphic imaging , dose distribution ) .    2.8017390509113564
the myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance , so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often .    3.760031696659468
the response rate , estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility , was 87 % with no major myelosuppressive effects .    3.1491288133139776
the mean duration of pain relief was 4 - 6 weeks .    3.613781193351477
all four patients with repeated therapy were also UNK to the second treatment .    3.7315583198726188
radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium - 186 - hedp appears to be an effective and , even at higher doses , safe procedure .    3.2205093834202763
cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .    3.083589949728291
it is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis .    3.054687352870731
within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe sle due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application .    3.540948851688956
studies on the slightly more cost - effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published , however , there are no data on long - term results yet .    3.3981278276345015
here , we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in sle .    3.6580503296522933
because of the possible side effects , especially the high risk of malignancies , which UNK increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g , cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously .    3.9210644476973897
cyclophosphamide bolus therapy should only be performed in hospitals with special experience .    3.615135308568036
the optimal time to perform acute acl reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed .    3.607251409983961
most authors prefer delayed surgery .    3.2005487698979462
the definition of the term " acute " varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks .    2.9389800048807433
in this study the limit was set at 60 hours .    2.742325268003253
acute acl reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full rom .    3.62060820916919
the incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44 % lower in this population .    3.1551487100589655
when the indication is clear , we think that acute acl reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis .    3.4267105703522325
nowadays , this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons .    3.388701353508879
after some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for UNK and their parents with a special focus on parent - centered programs .    3.3151359994772975
positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development , parental sensitivity and the home environment .    3.7295330263219792
only parent - centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent - infant interaction .    3.243388382624545
it is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term .    3.158730806973748
further programs should focus on parent - and parent - infant centered interventions .    2.890557950352491
the surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described .    3.2069534738655925
UNK is the early treatment in UNK of UNK as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand .    4.44507745427046
a forearm orthesis with a simply rom - joint without UNK was used .    3.0122665145920475
possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated .    3.5841868865963438
matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) and their tissue inhibitors ( UNK ) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis .    3.847178369176496
in the study presented , matrix metalloproteinase 1 ( mmp1 ) and 3 ( mmp3 ) , the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 ( timp1 ) and the complex mmp1 / timp1 were measured by elisa tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma .    3.282621721072274
these components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients ( pca ) with metastases ( n = 18 ; t2 , 3 , 4 pn1 , UNK ) , prostate cancer patients without metastases ( n = 29 ; t2 , 3 UNK ) , patients with benign prostate hyperplasia ( bph ; n = 29 ) and in healthy men ( n = 35 ) .    3.981895085365487
mean values of mmp1 and of the complex mmp1 / timp1 were not different among the four groups .    3.0566154036529647
the mean values of mmp3 and especially timp1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls , bph patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases .    2.9223408550608596
ten of these 18 patients had timp1 levels higher than the upper reference limit .    3.355916838799419
timp1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade .    3.936645812504926
these results indicate , that timp1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients .    2.7513077840096223
the interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach .    3.092395183291701
as in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device ( asdos ) is affected by late complications , particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations .    2.9420460735642138
the demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an asdos device .    3.3190830249881365
the diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation .    3.470700030128691
for early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after asdos implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about UNK problems of this device is essential .    3.6298367822182622
every asdos patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography .    2.945126080942434
the emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately .    3.0608910358800934
furthermore , the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications .    3.1062158132701265
this study evaluated the long - term outcome of patients with out - of - hospital cardiac arrests in a country - area .    3.596063184276394
the economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant .    3.3013886061072455
approximately 1 to 2 % of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis , treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure .    3.755659389115131
a great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long - term complications and productivity losses .    3.5002475079954327
in order to manage these costs , providers and UNK increasingly have to focus on UNK attractive interventions .    2.9354613153351643
teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work - up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics .    3.9428416560499118
due to more complex therapeutic strategies and legally defined formal requirements , the need for teleconsultation will increase significantly in the future .    3.303057733565709
rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation ( based upon an UNK network in the beginning , later on by the use of a national health network ) .    3.1328538137302675
the medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery .    3.2113606628199975
however , the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear .    3.2727193469749336
all UNK surgeons and orthopedists in private practice in berlin ( approx .    2.939937114640599
3 . 5 million inhabitants ) were contacted in march 1997 and asked to cooperate .    3.338139065367516
an 18 - point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician ' s experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints , which was returned by only 112 ( 25 % ) .    3.2966839436471527
according to their assessment these physicians treated ca .    3.183400593725849
47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca .    3.089452754170457
UNK with a history of a UNK trauma over a 12 - month - period ( 1996 ) .    4.087681155007066
all responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints ; about 60 % stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year , 25 % a smaller and 15 % a greater number of patients .    3.2188886446253306
the average treatment time was stated to be 2 - 5 weeks by 60 % of the physicians , 10 % listed a peak of 6 - 7 weeks and another 10 % in excess of this peak .    3.619683900559885
symptoms / findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca .    3.1772433957994575
50 % of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half .    3.418174363993107
it is noteworthy that the physician ' s point of view was influenced by personal accident experience ( accident as a car UNK ) : 54 % of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be UNK compared to only 35 % of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms .    3.3188399523435406
the statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22 % of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62 % of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement .    3.3518046265356087
of the physicians 32 % were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18 % considered them sometimes a disease parameter .    2.9381077623638734
the " subject physician " in the context of " whiplash injury " is not yet sufficiently investigated but seems to be an interesting topic of further research .    3.5944201988492117
to measure dilation of large retinal branch vessels .    3.144619483008929
the paper UNK of the many psychiatrists , neurologists , and pathologists connected with scientific work in neuropathology who were expelled from germany between 1933 and 1939 because of UNK by the nuremberg laws or because of their political opposition .    3.2915835709432724
many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide .    2.8398875038005222
short UNK give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries .    3.0132844543762367
the effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in germany have not been very intensive .    2.9440284521733373
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery .    2.7802261698920487
we describe a new mri technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to UNK .    2.733659561515884
this technique is based on three - dimensional t1 - and t2 - weighted sequences .    3.5397234897603345
the familiar panoramic view in mri provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier .    2.9234823011525193
moreover , the final workup is also time - consuming .    2.814544916799177
these restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software .    2.9696833764950057
there are promising indications for dental mri .    3.0084237590741845
during recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles .    3.5602169275907194
despite its technical simplicity , home ventilation leads to a number of social , ethical , medical and UNK problems .    3.531707344868054
this consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current UNK in the following topics : ( 1 ) definition of home ventilation ; ( 2 ) aims of home ventilation ; ( 3 ) indications and preconditions of home ventilation ; ( 4 ) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support ; ( 5 ) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation ; ( 6 ) stopping home ventilation .    3.3609841683087285
pseudo - obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction .    3.434212821503098
it is rarely after hip surgery , however , untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon .    3.687486212658488
in a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients ( 4 women , 7 men , mean age 75 . 2 years , range 67 to 86 years ) with pseudo - obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998 .    3.505892047234475
in relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip , the prevalence was 1 . 06 % .    4.524925304820531
the leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension .    3.035186614571395
on plain x - rays , dilatation of the colon measured 13 . 3 cm on average ( 9 - 16 cm ) .    3.799445386426974
in two patients ( 18 % ) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro - intestinal motility was sufficient , whereas in 8 patients ( 73 % ) UNK decompression had to be performed .    3.119144003361373
one patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis .    2.9358344416328057
2 patients ( 18 % ) died because of a complicated course .    3.57080207838599
non operative treatment should not exceed 24 hours , endoscopic decompression and tube placement is considered as the treatment of choice .    3.350799463600816
in cases of failure of these procedures , perforation of the colon and / or UNK , urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential .    3.4988518007468983
anti - UNK increased from year to year in nazi germany from 1933 to 1945 .    3.055807140823845
the fear of annihilation resulted in a UNK of suicides .    4.277863163355537
the suicides of at least 9 jewish dermatologists has been documented .    3.3467121902403054
their mean age was 65 years .    3.67749306975822
couples often committed suicide together .    3.519075553293099
at the end of world war ii , the head of the dermatological department of the prague university committed suicide .    3.0415455662463935
we assume the same happened in rostock and dresden .    2.8327719087904697
the president of the german dermatological society ( UNK ) committed suicide on march 27 , 1945 .    3.67551324594515
the motives of these dermatologists were obviously the collapse of UNK and the fear of UNK measures .    3.643235504599819
UNK is a biomaterial derived from natural UNK , and it has surgical applications .    3.480637430025587
since 1992 the author has been using this material as a bone graft substitute in maxillofacial surgery .    2.887903482076854
the results suggest that UNK grafts are well tolerated and become partially ossified when the calcified skeleton is resorbed .    2.8195950243068193
this material has been demonstrated to be successful .    3.5214487968890973
aim : an overview on the evidence - based indications for an immunosuppressive treatment with azathioprine in chronic inflammatory bowel diseases is given .    3.2387664629667996
background : the aim of the study was the evaluation of how ophthalmological diagnoses and the proportion of multiply handicapped children has changed within the last 20 years at a state school for visually handicapped and blind children .    2.957569098027633
introduction : visual impairment as the initial symptom of leukemia is rare .    2.9101240100398176
although retinal involvement during leukemia is frequent , a leukemic macular lesion is an exception .    2.992545822743712
introduction : it was our aim to evaluate the results of laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal hernia repair ( tapp ) with regard to recurrent hernias treated in our department .    3.6555409657182887
methods : included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair .    2.7475721012363845
all final repairs were carried out using the tapp technique .    3.3256723973015765
the data were collected prospectively .    3.0430812520130535
the patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively .    3.294207689298208
the rate of follow - up amounted to 78 . 1 % at 1 year after operation .    3.7784158863583666
results : perioperative complications were monitored prospectively and divided into intraoperative , minor and major .    2.987124817652859
the overall complication rate amounted to 9 % , major complications 5 . 3 % .    3.2791257098603275
the re - recurrence rate was 0 . 4 % .    3.4078416747514004
because of biomechanical overload , articular structures , tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography , sonography ( us ) , or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .    2.834437030963477
findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of UNK and bursitis of the os calcis .    4.197031491522683
despite the progressive course of rheumatic diseases and characteristic imaging findings , high variability of x - ray signs may occur .    3.1587015273504893
plain film radiograms and high - resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot .    3.4376173283462674
mri supports imaging diagnosis in selected cases .    2.9985965058547617
the principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment .    2.7994673211157988
background : we evaluated the prevalence of the loss of visual acuity due to loss of the central portion of the visual field and UNK fixation in the first week after glaucoma filtering surgery .    3.5407823312300657
the aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors .    2.5367555740548364
basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf ) was incorporated into dl polylactic acid ( pla ) UNK under hyperbaric co2 pressure in two different ways .    2.908272513262226
( 1 ) lyophilized bfgf was crushed and mixed with pla granules , filled into UNK moulds of 5 x 3 mm , and submitted to hyperbaric co2 pressure .    2.8818308462844113
( 2 ) lyophilized bfgf was UNK in phosphate buffer , mixed with pla granules , and UNK .    2.9558858826174332
in vitro assessment of bfgf release from the pla implants by immunoassay showed that loading of pla with crushed lyophilized bfgf resulted in a rapid and high release , while loading by UNK bfgf and UNK led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor .    2.968913191344027
intestinal neuronal dysplasia ( ind ) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children .    3.28483922869859
in recent years this abnormality has also been observed in adults with chronic constipation .    3.3372766871080675
the aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease .    2.3348441909303275
the investigation was performed with 10 adults with ind , compared with 10 healthy control probands .    3.194923130110324
ind is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified .    4.008914020497822
extracorporal shock - wave application ( eswa ) has been used in the treatment of stones located in the kidneys , bile , pancreas and the glandula parotis .    2.5005853555411353
in the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of eswa in the treatment of soft - tissue disorders and UNK calcarea .    3.2841069180049187
to date , the exact mechanism is unknown .    2.7228229225628215
local hyperemia following damage or afferent inhibition is discussed .    2.857994262293678
the results show the benefit of eswa in the treatment of chronic soft - tissue disorders without severe side effects .    2.6555413137212547
some patients showed small subcutaneous hematomas and erosion of the skin when energies about 20 mj were used .    3.139018248565899
forty - seven of 84 of the patients obtained complete relief ; 24 patients showed a marked reduction in their complaints .    3.8835291631550084
up to now there are no facts concerning the loosening rate of the cemented titanium stem ( UNK ) .    2.893116010709154
the central guiding UNK and the longitudinal drilled stem shall ensure a symmetric cement UNK .    3.339208974207371
management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial .    3.1354460668282464
local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of UNK lesions .    3.6163490565941383
the vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction ( vpler ) may be a more successful approach to such lesions .    3.413113797918968
the charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors ' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with vpler as described by UNK in 1965 , UNK in 1976 and UNK in 1979 .    4.046490291089685
indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery , surgical technique , perioperative complications , oncological outcomes and functional results .    3.5998113855204696
twelve patients were identified that had been treated with vpler .    3.730435850829033
indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies , four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure ( t2 n0 - 2 UNK ) , two with local recurrences following radiotherapy , and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy .    3.2926068853855486
there were no postoperative complications except for one UNK fistula that required secondary repair .    2.6913692913035883
all patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day .    2.78782247987414
all had their UNK closed after completion of wound healing , ( a mean of 17 days after surgery ) .    3.635341388980477
UNK results were usually poor .    3.2452065101944503
two local recurrences occurred during the follow - up period .    3.1598107253552303
however , both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease .    3.0896117051192675
all other patients are alive and well .    2.750009295638247
our findings show that vpler is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with UNK laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy .    2.865806596679374
no major complications occurred in our study .    3.9989913507514587
we are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery fmd , in one case each .    2.830782915383277
we present a patient in whom color - coded duplex - sonography revealed a web - like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal fmd .    2.6123932517670134
the relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated .    3.8614556447519233
data analysis was based on two assumptions : ( 1 ) presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery , and , therefore , depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure .    3.3299369142358635
( 2 ) postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery , and therefore , depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure .    2.8188902288823994
the sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis .    3.1082124297661506
treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group .    3.6448327995298655
depression was assessed with the UNK depression inventory ( UNK ) .    3.8733647787073378
measures of treatment outcome were an objective rating system for the surgical result , functional impairment , return to work , subjective estimations of the patient , and pain intensity .    3.6959923003419313
presurgical depression scores showed no significant relationship with surgical outcome in nucleotomy patients .    3.469954246223271
in spondylodesis patients , however , there was a significant negative correlation with the patients ' subjective outcome ratings .    4.194073827080337
postsurgical depression scores , on the other hand , were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups .    3.738873277060587
patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores .    3.1118058417177172
our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption .    2.8976071316781256
in the light of our findings , depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non - beneficial outcome of surgery .    3.094289150930947
the need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed .    3.274449861308518
using electron - beam computed tomography ( ebct ) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images / s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart .    3.3220985988256753
various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of ebct to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes ( ml ) , myocardial mass ( g ) , wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle ( mm / s ) , myocardial perfusion ( ml / 100 g / min ) and the extent of coronary calcification ( calcium score ) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4 - 6 cm of the UNK coronary arteries .    3.9018148484022754
the knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction , in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions .    4.176226954901798
further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants , especially myocardial perfusion , using this advanced ct technology .    3.2636159789282977
fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence .    3.7039768544988654
the majority occur in sport and play activities , e . g . , a fall from UNK apparatus or a bike , or from popular sports items , such as UNK or in - line UNK .    2.9453547823579336
the injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus , proximal radius and ulna , or combinations of both .    3.5954892780689587
in addition , extra - and intraarticular fracture types are defined , with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions .    3.3800005773292585
dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture .    3.631723526506516
supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial UNK are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus .    5.228360250046416
fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions .    2.974280495067493
in the forearm , radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical UNK injuries have a special status .    3.2276300670161886
the complex joint construction and the age - dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult .    3.307787080666033
the trauma history and an exact , clinical examination help to verify the injury , as do comparative x - ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary ( but not routinely ) .    3.311095632915796
unlike other anatomical areas , most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively .    3.164396191965533
additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults .    4.056560497066309
the implants should be removed as early as possible .    2.7191001450847234
despite all therapeutic efforts , a significant number of late sequelae , such as UNK and functional impairment , can be seen .    3.83200181825201
the rate of long - term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability .    3.496202713958271
corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed .    4.143723994519817
our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long - term follow - up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children .    3.965608775195138
errors in diagnosis and therapy , as well as possible complications , are pointed out .    3.727156149604962
2 - adrenergic agonists , mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine , cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of UNK projection neurons , presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves , presynaptic inhibition of brainstem UNK neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity .    2.8594532790176506
there is a mutual UNK of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine .    3.074404636203013
clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic , UNK and UNK pain .    5.075383348642645
based on a meta - analysis of the studies published in the years 1996 - 1996 , the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states .    3.7181076866362996
out of 403 screened published studies , only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria .    3.022923418436777
besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment , four placebo - controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states : chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms ; painful diabetic neuropathy ; UNK UNK ; UNK in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain .    3.325677025639094
although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores , the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight .    3.9040176247575813
long - term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months .    3.8441363634415495
hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical ( transdermal ) application of clonidine .    3.0180658899512496
based on this evaluation a grade c recommendation is derived , which relates to responders .    2.777765073131451
successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity .    3.277800558776046
therefore , in chronic pain , treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value .    3.3597210792588776
study objective : to investigate whether automatic tube compensation ( atc ) or conventional pressure support ( ps ) is UNK - able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern .    2.9019606388037715
dna - based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( rdeb ) .    2.9828485432092364
dna from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring , dna from parental leukocytes and dna from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct pcr amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type vii collagen gene , the UNK gene in rdeb .    3.002445409007114
one flanking marker ( UNK / mspi ) as well as two UNK polymorphisms ( c7 / mspi , c7 / UNK ) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family .    3.5640030775758493
thus , based on the UNK analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in rdeb , a phenotypically healthy child was predicted .    3.536321853454869
this prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant .    3.274373390781604
the study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by pcr - based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe rdeb .    3.1624649463226633
endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties .    2.9084017078285664
it has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term .    3.2435882284364035
the synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin - action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts .    2.869609051125616
this review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease .    2.7820002466472715
the combination of fast mr sequences and rapid i . v . injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion .    2.952953603814893
mr - perfusion imaging primarily UNK the relative cerebral blood volume .    3.0469868755391465
the aim of this study was to test whether mr - perfusion imaging with a clinical mr scanner using a standard 2d - flash sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors .    2.8271216935463936
brain infarctions , lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls .    2.9944297857644457
however , our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method , which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow .    3.6293224955732653
lumbar microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach .    3.173361581250377
the microscope is the best surgical aid .    3.747909607246309
alternatives are a UNK light or UNK .    3.932760999093761
a specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning .    3.054243544085889
other complications like dural lesions and UNK bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view .    3.675019056392458
the most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation , major vessel or visceral injury , can be avoided by UNK the new UNK with a depth UNK .    3.632265243266503
from january 1987 to march 1994 three hospitals in the city of magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous achilles tendon ruptures operatively .    2.9578702443803886
we created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used .    4.204680538677477
important aspects of the follow - up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a UNK - UNK dynamic measuring device and the clinical check - up in comparison with the histological results and the patients ' history .    4.360560769460455
degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38 , 8 % of the cases .    3.568359391343128
the average score of all op methods applied was UNK of possible 1000 points .    3.1724459521514508
the adaptation suture ( UNK points ) , UNK ' s technique ( UNK points ) and the fibrin adhesive technique ( UNK points ) showed approximately the same results .    3.7381476731377394
the theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong .    3.578779501064474
isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load .    3.371609909761847
to determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain , we investigated 89 patients before , during and after general anesthesia .    3.0980188546847587
we examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction , because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were UNK .    2.813717873590036
for complete muscle relaxation as required for UNK intubation a non UNK muscle relaxant was used .    3.280483657314933
somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side - inclination and UNK in segment o / c1 .    3.5189161474190165
both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations ( 89 , 1 % ) similar UNK of joint motions .    4.219885669598943
to 10 , 9 % were found , that somatic dysfunctions established before the muscle relaxant was applicated , were no more demonstrable under complete blockade of neuromuscular transmission .    3.2354341396850015
different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results .    3.7237620763423003
we assume , that the disturbance of one component of the UNK organized segment is the basic UNK of somatic dysfunction .    4.077830287401632
this disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment .    2.971013796818168
subsequently we discuss to replace the term " somatic dysfunction " through " segmental dysfunction " and to define it as increasing of UNK afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold .    3.1846699035914137
postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra - abdominal operations .    3.5653033071385907
the postoperative delay of bowel movement , however , is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used .    3.4818388932156337
in order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic - induced postoperative delay of bowel movement , two types of intravenous - based anaesthesia using fentanyl / midazolam ( 1 mg / 25 mg ; dosage 0 . 1 ml / kg / h ) , and ketamine / midazolam ( 250 mg / 25 mg ; dosage 0 . 1 ml / kg / h ) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique ( enflurane ; mean concentration 1 . 5 vol % ) .    2.9914843401747944
in three groups of patients ( each n = 15 ) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities , induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital ( 1 - 1 . 5 mg ) followed by succinylcholine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) to facilitate intubation .    3.7649616327068194
for the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium UNK was used .    3.233141325379782
all patients were given droperidol to prevent postoperative emesis , and they were UNK ventilated with n2o / o2 ( 60 : 40 ) to normal end - expiratory co2 concentrations .    3.0809119541751184
no anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility .    3.5137822092485314
in order to determine gastro - intestinal motility , the h2 exhalation test was used .    2.679256118167591
for this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a UNK tube shortly before extubation .    2.944511790434092
lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it UNK the colon , and h2 is released , taken up by the vascular system and exhaled .    3.2131430094553273
postoperatively , patients were asked to UNK into a 20 - ml syringe every 10 min .    3.103316726727698
the content was analysed for hydrogen ( ppm ) , using an electrochemical sensor ( UNK exhaled hydrogen monitor ) .    2.9287925726440966
from the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration ( compared to the preoperative value ) , gastro - coecal transit time was computed .    3.0822410632361126
all three groups of patients were comparable in age , height and body weight .    3.830044068899589
also , the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups .    3.6827061145501987
mean gastro - coecal transit time was 204 ( + / - 19 . 6 sd ) min following enflurane , 302 ( + / - 32 . 8 sd ) min following fentanyl / - midazolam and 210 ( + / - 28 . 8 sd ) min following ketamine / midazolam anaesthesia .    2.859238422524306
the gastro - intestinal inhibition after the opioid - based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged ( p < 0 . 001 , kruskal - wallis test ) .    2.6760642036271105
there was no significance between patients after ketamine - based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic .    3.20804780157576
when using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid , gastro - intestinal inhibition , especially in patients prone to have constipation , is likely to develop postoperatively .    3.273004544945666
in classical UNK and in UNK in the icu , the simultaneous use of the UNK droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid - related gastrointestinal motility .    4.427483186714796
in cases of opioid - related gastrointestinal atonia a UNK compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility .    2.989599427509634
in a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb .    2.7914580678137306
all sonograms were obtained in four planes using a 7 . 5 mhz transducer .    3.6411376937555815
the distraction gap was seen as a UNK area in all patients after corticotomy .    3.7946283954323037
at an average of 20 . 7 ( 14 - 28 ) days after the beginning of the distraction , UNK foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction .    3.450499588277694
radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48 . 3 days after the start of the distraction .    4.024753447236332
exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening .    4.290859372452809
bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound .    3.275425423498355
a rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped .    3.0922455987673034
with increasing UNK of the UNK bone , sonograms showed a hyper - reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound .    4.092578891411527
ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction , measuring the length of the distraction gap , and detecting early bone - healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs .    3.307483780184113
the interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated .    3.6627511531651176
during a 1 - year period , patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor .    4.174970618443219
also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ent specialist and actual referral to our department .    2.8646460097330686
we then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy .    3.454189104615978
it was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter ( median , 8 weeks ) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors ( median , 13 weeks ) ( p < 0 . 02 ) .    3.292138532076643
the latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist .    2.935345817766035
referral from the ent specialist to our department took another 2 weeks , as well as our staging and pre - therapeutic management .    3.9732207626670957
our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy .    3.080934751317226
tumor patients with greater professional qualification went to their doctors earlier ( p < 0 . 0001 ) or more often went directly to an ent specialist ( p < 0 . 002 ) .    2.895912734608153
consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays .    3.2671357286170495
the present study deals with long - term dimensional changes in cemented UNK - type total hip endoprostheses .    3.524941894231204
UNK and wear contribute to different UNK to the dimensional changes in polyethylene .    3.3441011500023654
the total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the UNK .    3.350956818003226
within the first postoperative years , the head shifts up to a relatively high rate of about 0 . 5 mm per year .    4.11279477618293
this rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0 . 1 mm ( ceramics ) and 0 . 2 mm ( metal ) per year .    3.954765147543766
values exceeding 0 . 2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis .    3.546302195445919
in this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup , comprising in all UNK total hip prostheses .    3.00672248606304
after an average of 77 months , 96 % of the prostheses with ceramic heads ( n = 109 ) had a wear rate of less than 0 . 2 mm per year .    3.501954103024432
using metal heads ( protasul - 2 and protasul - 10 ) this rate could only be measured in 71 % ( n = 109 ) of the prostheses ( 61 . 5 months ) .    3.9329203206596897
the combination ceramics - polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal - polyethylene .    3.156354355859583
younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic UNK .    3.651934444785945
the so - called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years .    3.1956038240580575
one UNK the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema , erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony UNK ( so - called gottron ' s papules ) , generalized pruritus , UNK , and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis .    3.204551892627278
crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination , emg and histology .    4.02829244046483
furthermore , longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis .    3.293444124044077
the longest reported follow - up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years ; however , it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually UNK in classical dermatomyositis .    3.4906198241199666
in this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy ; also , the term " UNK dermatomyositis " is proposed , to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases .    3.4243381718938184
the primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor .    3.073648335217718
making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult .    3.5354475210585785
because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with UNK and UNK .    3.7270164989850905
this study compares the results of the outpatient - based program of the cochlear implant center ruhr with inpatient - based rehabilitation , which is almost exclusively performed in germany .    3.1173745227114424
the department of otorhinolaryngology at the university of essen in germany provided 52 patients with either 22 - or 24 - channel nucleus cochlear implants from march 1996 to july 1999 .    3.2546774945019665
almost all patients ( n = 49 ) were UNK on an outpatient basis , which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside germany .    4.028798681764683
syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics , intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous , constant and reproducible flow .    3.2103945240873744
for early recognition of UNK of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system , an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit .    3.550379673099695
the sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate , type - specific cut - off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system .    3.656586763213515
the sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard .    3.1434601992734885
methods : six syringe drivers that are widely used in clinical practice were tested for alarm delay and bolus delivery in the event of an occlusion in the system .    3.135519335014802
first , the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10 , 50 and 100 ml / h were measured .    3.006858640342889
then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post - occlusion were assessed , using a basic infusion system ( syringe + single infusion set ) .    2.98502695319374
finally , several alterations to the system like extension , tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured .    2.6640086883720224
results : because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested , there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates .    3.4892611789456933
predictably , there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate .    3.9289209346160336
using the basic infusion system , alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured .    2.816859108348746
in two of the tested syringe drivers , a pressure - release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm , which prevented bolus application .    3.0368407839511327
in the other devices , release of the pressure in the occluded system caused UNK of 0 . 5 - 7 ml .    3.9131875926135598
variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume .    2.9829433226085165
tap batteries , parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system , however , caused marked increase in both alarm delay ( 107 % ) and bolus volume ( + 147 % ) .    3.494299627935631
discussion : unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave UNK of syringe drivers .    3.135879499458226
while applying highly potent drugs , the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient .    2.960398457781853
as a result of the significant time delays in the pressure UNK , the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion .    3.2148107046723706
syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure .    3.2647280955227425
a further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume .    3.1605562142568018
because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory , it is rarely used .    3.7222342650991216
however , minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous k - wire pinning are being increasingly used .    3.088488859349817
a justified indication for the use of k - wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short - and long - term anatomic and functional results .    3.5955046510453736
short - term supplementary immobilization with a minimized plaster cast or protective external fixation is generally considered to be useful .    3.6952821385665726
reports on plaster - free functional treatment after k - wire pinning have been published .    3.0061263165299303
the indications therefore need to be further specified .    3.414811639654475
follow - up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in k - wire stabilization and good - to - very good results in 75 % of the cases .    3.802066388517417
UNK of the UNK tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare .    3.3343181591114526
rapid proliferating burkitt ' s lymphomas could mimic acute diseases .    2.827290959588066
due to the extreme UNK , the lymphoma is UNK and surgery should be done only for histology .    4.03289568547786
initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease .    3.3780431175216874
wet autoclaving is a simple , reliable and time - effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed UNK material .    3.165003005149279
both routine diagnostic ( e . g . , oestrogen and progesterone receptors , cytoskeletal proteins ) and research antibodies ( e . g . various p53 antibodies , mdm - 2 , bcl - 2 , mib - 1 ) are reported to demonstrate its application .    3.3109142749292784
wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin - embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections .    2.6954491036014407
the technique has the UNK - UNK to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time , without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology .    3.806848259553761
classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning , absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and UNK bone .    3.213665595696432
in cortical bone , the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation .    3.29542714130862
direct cortical synthesis , a method also known as " primary bone healing " , serves the bone ' s revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing .    3.1608960873024805
thus , this may also be termed " necrosis healing " .    3.244807181278489
along the shaft of long bones , elastic plate osteosynthesis , a biological method , is safer than and superior to the rigid technique .    3.1264789221158784
this even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible .    2.819343104453523
elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes , i . e .    3.44510874324859
as long as possible , without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate .    3.2207433327690147
thus , there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate UNK .    2.9568747658597423
the fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out .    2.9844621672432
the same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws , tension devices or UNK - gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing UNK in the fracture ' s UNK .    3.410784156317613
periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined .    3.597076748722723
healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first 3 - 6 weeks out of the periost - soft tissue combination .    3.458182272803633
histomorphological investigation dates the first woven - bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident .    3.1498073369020556
in göttingen university trauma centre , 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique .    3.0996720323938027
despite considerable soft - tissue damage , no delayed bone healing , pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed .    3.107409023384733
the risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in UNK and exaggerated reposition methods , too short a flexible stretch , and insufficient anchorage of the screws .    3.084605168287855
diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100 % certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography .    3.3860294010229937
a correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner .    3.642570289946495
both methods are available throughout germany .    2.9445441911456025
although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations , duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive .    3.7044207506695015
phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified .    3.2156760115735947
this applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered , if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined .    3.109784116066317
in many institutions , both methods are used in a " golden partnership " in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records .    3.8497366659050156
for frequent ventricular ectopic beats , currently , reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the UNK of treatment .    3.5840165766394647
this study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients .    2.823192381823461
catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats .    3.5870031125450863
the site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping , earliest endocardial activation time , and UNK mapping .    3.5829812111310035
in 5 patients a new non - contact mapping was additionally performed .    2.7204641725364502
the ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients .    3.7488840112711874
ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49 / 65 patients ( 75 % ) .    3.051445600545057
during a mean follow up of 13 + / - 11 months , 9 of 49 successful ablated patients ( 18 % ) had a recurrence .    3.5271958897768054
radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity .    3.0804920420253907
it may , therefore , be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic , drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity .    3.3213223926084714
injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons .    3.422308793799422
after healing of bone and soft tissue damage , posttraumatic UNK can persist .    3.8921711138635042
the paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed UNK , which consist of the common orthopaedic UNK like a UNK bottom and a stiffening of the sole .    3.1654608474878163
the therapy is shown on two cases .    3.300557128651073
with these UNK adequate is possible and pain relief realistic .    3.6921337714994427
background : myopic prk up to 6 d is an approved and safe procedure .    3.0800340968670006
the efficacy and safety of combined treatment of myopia and astigmatism in compound myopic astigmatism ( park ) have not yet been demonstrated .    2.9618360083077673
nitric oxide ( no ) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission , as well as in non - specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues .    3.5160677290156888
increased quantities of nitric oxide in UNK air can be measured during inflammatory processes .    3.2650327669352386
however , the exact role and precise sources of no under physiological and pathophysiological conditions within the airways remain to be defined .    3.045885926446535
a thallium - 201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non - transmural septal ischemia .    3.147020589146815
the consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe , almost pouch - like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15 - 20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function ( ef 49 % ) .    3.501742740258389
in the absence of coronary artery stenosis , the patient was treated conservatively with an ace inhibitor ( UNK 20 mg / day ) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with UNK .    3.751578606046149
with this strategy the patient has been UNK during the eight month follow - up period .    3.420750200151245
we investigated in 17 children ( mean 7 . 1 years ) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation UNK or UNK reconstruction .    3.6077938070397653
mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3 . 8 + / - 1 . 1 days ( initial dosage 0 . 25 mg / kg / per hour , dose adjustment by the nursing staff ) .    3.530872571458009
mean tramadol consumption was 0 . 21 mg / kg / h on day 1 and was reduced to 0 . 08 mg / kg / per hour on day 4 .    3.5626236711171417
lowest oxygen UNK ( mean ) ranged from 93 . 8 % to 95 . 2 % .    3.8099525358040793
three patients ( 17 . 6 % ) suffered from nausea / vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days ( 4 . 7 % ) .    3.2391328282974277
pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur .    2.94792904641814
the continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children .    2.952988419275297
over the past 5 - 7 years , there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer " emerging " treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation .    3.7505056234334266
one of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator .    2.8758617250722796
in this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially - available implantable atrial cardioversion devices .    3.1802677499724563
the main UNK identified were sodium ( 134 + / - 38 mmol / l ) and potassium ( 37 + / - 16 mmol / l ) and as UNK chloride ( 183 + / - 46 mmol / l ) and bicarbonate ( 10 + / - 4 mmol / l ) .    3.3087309191888252
the ph value of the pus liquid was 6 . 164 + / - 0 . UNK .    3.208468433029623
the calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was UNK + / - UNK mm hg , whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49 + / - 13 mm hg .    3.3261992600419035
both pressure types show time - dependent pressure curves .    3.4175237815940886
with time , the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases , whereas the osmotic pressure decreases .    3.192266505227795
there was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation .    3.565210321459487
the results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as UNK active systems , and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows .    3.562231722297452
after penetration of UNK microorganisms into the tissue space , the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells .    3.2868174093931013
destruction of tissue by products of the UNK UNK takes place and results in UNK necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity .    3.9865401631907518
the UNK - directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure , two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area .    2.8687816139074913
internal mammary artery ( ima ) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium .    2.8500688859674455
their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia .    2.997273075988178
this study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the ima graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia .    3.4758686697631154
twenty - five patients with multi - vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the ima as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries .    3.0214382578906407
distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood - UNK arrest .    3.1845484265762813
after UNK the aorta and ima graft , the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion .    2.9157719377342386
a sufficient ima graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature : the cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course , respectively .    2.6689814298147225
the rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side , and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side .    3.576749519701388
an insufficient ima graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses .    3.0405429695398793
UNK ' s disease ( UNK UNK UNK ) is a rare x - chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of UNK .    4.248344833418059
the basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha - galactosidase .    2.9604915914769507
because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of UNK , its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells .    3.511165767838516
with time , generalized UNK , paresthesias , renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop .    2.903107933616634
we report a patient who in addition to the well - described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far .    3.020244861312402
analysis of serum concentration of alpha - galactosidase identified three female heterozygous carriers in the patient ' s family .    3.2566187225051664
benign , proliferative changes of the brunner ' s gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias .    3.367191416209776
the authors present a case of brunner ' s gland adenoma of unusual dimensions ( 12 x 5 x 2 . 5 cm ) .    2.984144586897038
the patient presented with UNK epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms .    3.1528053300348957
in this case we performed surgical treatment , including a UNK and polypectomy .    3.8784591803220745
because they are localized in the UNK small , superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis .    3.2218139911242356
malignancy seems to occur only very rarely , with only 14 cases reported in the literature .    3.032687831218029
as the majority of brunner ' s adenomas are quite small , endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases .    3.4913665582674365
large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection .    3.1573857814368735
objective : how does adjuvant training of strength and endurance influence the muscular , cardial , respiratory , immunological systems , and the quality of life during UNK chemotherapy in a UNK athlete with liver metastasis after resection of a carcinoma of the rectum .    3.580357295825401
patient and method : a 58 - year - old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum ( UNK , n0 , m - liver , g2 ) underwent regional chemotherapy ( UNK acid , 5 - fluorouracil ) via an intrahepatic port system .    3.6310816370370875
six cycles with 5 days each were applied .    3.269537931164631
during the intervals between cycles ( 14 days ) , beginning in the 6th postoperative week , a strength and endurance training ( duration 13 weeks ) was carried out twice weekly with an intensity of 40 - 60 % of the maximum postoperative individual power and endurance ( evaluated with weight and treadmill exercise tests and measurement of lactate ) .    3.226564439051527
before and after chemotherapy , an echocardiogram , resting and exercise electrocardiogram , lung function , natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index ( glqi ) was evaluated .    3.0926674794583566
after chemotherapy was finished , the effects of training were assumed .    3.703418422687004
results : strength increased between 0 % and 144 % .    2.838488035460741
endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step , expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21 . 5 % , respectively , improvement of lung function regarding UNK 1 and UNK by 12 . 9 and 11 . 3 % , respectively , and UNK in 11 . 4 % .    4.146550379338282
the relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27 . 2 % , and the glqi improved from 109 points ( pathologic ) to 129 points ( normal ) .    3.294808104234543
conclusion : there were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness - related quality of life .    2.9300014439232993
postoperative sports activity during regional chemotherapy is possible .    3.273025426704019
introduction : we report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients .    3.3400990213817825
the laparoscopic technique is presented and the results are discussed with respect to the data from the current literature .    4.257303339084291
material and methods : since 1993 , a total of 249 patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease .    3.4657567225423005
in 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy ( in most cases via a transperitoneal approach ) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision .    3.468505937240071
clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups .    3.962644590256275
results : there were no differences in terms of operative results ( operative time , pre - and postoperative hemoglobin ) between the laparoscopy group and open nephrectomy group as well as among the different age groups .    3.6938894392292356
patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss , transfusion rate , analgesic consumption , hospital stay , and convalescence .    3.5361325067471303
these advantages were not related to patient age .    3.490641895206
the complication rate was comparable for both groups ; however , both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years .    3.505769596989877
the mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1 . 7 % in the open nephrectomy group .    3.9948730384156566
conclusions : the laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results ( with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate ) when compared to open nephrectomy .    3.279155043228184
in terms of postoperative parameters , patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages .    3.487205646084445
especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and , therefore , the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients .    3.693872139397007
the vast majority of adder bites among children in germany is caused by the common viper ( vipera berus ) .    2.9687050527147636
the venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes , some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity .    3.1198277927249225
adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication .    3.0987164193228853
the aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability .    2.5623803235898324
some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months ( 24 - 60 ) after stabilization .    3.8091684516886297
the mean age at the time of operation was 29 . 7 years .    2.8188219173407725
all patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks .    2.8313073746131847
according to the criteria of rowe , 29 patients ( 90 . 6 % ) had good or excellent results .    3.4351456811943524
two patients ( 6 . 3 % ) developed recurrent instability 6 - 24 months postoperatively ; 93 . 7 % were not or only UNK limited in sports activities .    3.6643282865063695
bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability .    3.247861579757734
the use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of UNK the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint .    3.23870195049171
purpose : assessment of coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) patency with computed tomography methods has been demonstrated as an alternative to coronary angiography .    3.499163365221558
the evaluation of the bypass anastomoses is still of limited success .    3.1122608415913566
prospective ecg triggering of conventional ct scanners al - UNK heart phase - triggered single - slice acquisition in the sub - second range .    2.9050646164698546
the goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ecg triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal cabg anastomoses .    3.1672558774576394
multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by UNK and freud as well as by UNK .    3.878417917341875
in the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the UNK reactions in borderline personality disorder .    3.4646202534467836
the concept of comorbidity is criticized .    3.024001047047058
case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing UNK .    3.2493945350276596
the authors point out , that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing .    3.3309111247465846
but their development has its limits : in most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic " investigation " can be on a psychodynamic level a UNK of traumatic abuse .    3.8042500362466214
many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years , and some have already found their way into clinical routine .    3.349216313114587
cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment .    3.280110681870696
however , the short - term culture of oocytes before UNK ii does seem relevant .    3.079935614836196
UNK culture has mostly replaced UNK techniques and , given appropriate laws , provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential .    2.969891145982755
an exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation .    3.5151747493399608
viewing the latest data , assisted UNK seems to bring no improvements for most patients .    3.3848761954396553
preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in germany due to new statements from ethical committees .    3.2882349451479898
cytoplasma transfer , nuclear transfer , or the transplantation of UNK cells into donors are currently only experimental .    3.7558245266926193
the importance of spiral - ct is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors .    1.8537580285594373
its importance for follow - up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors .    2.1379185880547174
using spiral - ct multiple signs of alterations ( n = 98 ) can be diagnosed , which are not only important for tumour relapse , but also for assessment .    2.377282703553099
spiral - ct offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy .    2.2026123228221075
in follow - up examinations after radiation , laryngoscopy and spiral - ct are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath - holding technique ( separately reconstructed ) and also as functional spiral - ct of the vocal cords in " i " - phonation .    1.754678769621212
in the years 1980 - 1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the german UNK of bavaria and lower saxony .    3.5029588295537617
there was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis , i . e . from 199 / 205 in 1980 to 16 / 7 in 1992 .    2.7074182849585724
in both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically .    4.068275463040312
whereas in bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and UNK zoster encephalitides was apparent ( 1 / 4 in 1980 , 10 / 24 in 1992 ) , the same development was not found in lower saxony .    3.1929245027041024
although the number of measles encephalitides dropped in both states during the period of the survey , up to 6 cases of the illness occurred annually .    3.5973512114007673
only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period , while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same .    3.8646292513388127
purpose : to assess patient reliability and compliance , most UNK check for false - positive and - negative answers .    2.853140937961984
in this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video UNK with respect to age - related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli .    3.2359023919805026
during a 7 - year period ( between july 1987 and june 1994 ) 19 patients were treated for chopart dislocation .    3.058519280756965
seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma .    3.2930018606977995
we found 1 excellent , 6 good , 6 UNK , and 4 poor results .    3.8569991473546295
only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre - accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level .    3.5446437399243536
in our patients , chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities .    2.7266902092393113
in long - term follow - up , the chopart dislocation was the most UNK injury even for polytrauma patients .    3.4221597672595827
for incidents of malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) outside the hospital , a high number of UNK cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis .    3.306920657958592
as a result , there are no statistical data in this field , and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published .    3.355626026179074
the case described in this report is a proved example of a non - anesthesia - related triggering of mh in a 21 - year - old man who had had an anesthetic - induced mh manifestation in childhood , which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test .    3.3237650727505477
after UNK a UNK , he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol ( 2 . UNK ) .    3.4583101779748806
the first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization .    2.86695095306213
after admission , the patient showed a full - UNK mh episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy .    3.5191046367933665
suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be UNK ( excessive alcohol consumption , over - heating , mental stress ) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances .    3.251588757217275
the case demonstrates again that an mh attack might be triggered under certain non - anaesthesia - related situations .    2.8636011768177454
for patients with an mh disposition , additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required .    3.606524915936169
UNK UNK UNK of different species live worldwide as parasites in UNK mammals .    3.4978527721220556
in the host the larval development causes typical UNK , i . e . , abscesses including the UNK .    3.0737888192991027
as a result of increasing UNK traffic , UNK can also bring back to germany tropical types of UNK .    2.924410455326086
surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very UNK .    3.446149131072332
in a prospective survey ( 1993 - 1996 ) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material .    3.675654143616442
in 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive ( 20 - 30 l ) intraoperative lavage .    3.3017944901299017
additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage ( n = 17 ) or staged lavage ( n = 5 ) were applied only " on demand " , namely in 20 patients ( 11 % ) .    3.43765824710313
in 166 patients ( 89 % ) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible .    3.1433647222351295
the mean severity of peritonitis ( n = 186 ) was 28 . 5 ( range 16 - 43 ) using the mannheim peritonitis index .    3.601898153830794
the primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower gi tract ( 52 % ) .    3.1092109997427966
we conclude that nowadays , using high - quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment , only a few patients ( ca .    3.7366261746501226
10 % ) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage .    3.323613122497566
surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis .    4.162873351990013
native tissue harmonic imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult - to - image patient .    3.6291629836099486
by using a UNK shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections .    2.976987332489007
the improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary .    3.4980541997064836
aim : the aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound ( ivus ) .    2.607607321713137
method : 181 arteries were examined by 20 / 30 mhz ivus .    3.191273360924079
the ultrasound cross - sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic ( 30 kv ) and histologic cross - sections .    3.469094950269978
results : calcified lesions were imaged as bright UNK with UNK .    3.0496691559309967
in 13 cases of 161 calcified lesions were too small to detect by ivus .    2.914263092693205
in 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis " calcified lesion " could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology .    3.164876783946693
the sensitivity was 91 . 6 % , the specificity was 94 . 7 % and the accuracy was 93 . 0 % .    3.8936985749235773
conclusions : because of the acoustic properties of calcium , calcified lesions can be detected accurately by ivus .    3.145235206487351
ivus can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies .    3.5588425499293717
UNK UNK has called the holocaust " the dark core of the twentieth century " .    2.9004946559449922
it was the aim of weekly conferences , held in israel in 1994 and 1996 , to explore its UNK on current behaviour .    3.0378394761916288
the topic was " the past in the present " .    3.9882041886380177
the participants were UNK and UNK , the staff international .    4.441112630284501
the method used was the application of the " group relations conference " , specially devised for these conferences .    3.4051577559755235
the leadership was in the hands of UNK j . miller , director of the group relations program at the UNK institute of human relations in UNK , where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today .    3.445621468210097
it is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings .    2.8142010198626575
the task which had been put to the participants was as follows : to explore how feelings and UNK influence relations within and between the two groups .    2.889682308649965
this was easy to remember but not always easy to adhere to .    2.9118951237643667
there were moments when UNK and reality got confused , accompanied by intense feelings .    2.8657417700805152
in this paper my experience with a UNK for cases with bone diseases is reported .    3.567283531056769
all cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed department of bone pathology of the university of hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion .    3.210896606308513
adapting the system to state - of - the - art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment .    3.129973054332882
this could not be accomplished by university resources alone , but only in cooperation with other research funds .    3.472248984865473
now 76 000 cases can be routinely UNK and scientifically analysed .    3.0932853824066395
background and purpose : in germany , 750 , 000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24 - 48 months .    3.174561312388116
however , the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia .    3.100247439042979
the purpose of this study was to examine the cost - effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and UNK screening .    2.3897032744413984
the fluorescence diagnosis based on the UNK acid - stimulated UNK synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors .    3.7237197200231194
this topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization .    3.3008368593964317
the red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye ; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation .    2.9929678947734475
in our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity , 96 % of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence .    3.418231223624347
in 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise .    3.123415404739564
however , many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding .    3.3920599397581896
it was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce UNK after ala incubation , which leads to false - positive findings .    3.11492092467313
this improves the reliability of a fluorescence - guided biopsy .    3.1551323713459825
however , suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method .    3.7169725231546127
autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers .    3.208010953920892
based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response , autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation .    3.7328327178241807
increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude .    3.1610684938549465
automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds .    3.7972580222896575
thus , changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool .    3.234000245949844
this case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a UNK by means of autocapture .    4.510238781073937
the indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed UNK .    3.295624521022767
successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events .    3.985021471547741
however , several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events .    3.4141285454415016
tissue engineering offers the possibility to UNK living substitutes for tissues and organs by combining histogenic cells and biocompatible carrier materials .    2.9134190441753276
pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and UNK ex vivo and then their histogenic differentiation is induced by external factors .    3.227496831924165
the UNK of bone and cartilage constructs , their combinations and gene therapeutic approaches are demonstrated .    3.260704679303325
advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing .    3.657601692819178
the proof of UNK function after implantation in vivo is essential .    3.217971844402894
the use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts , UNK of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants .    3.0917963667848234
the purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results .    2.6055682130578126
when the aofas ankle - hindfoot rating scale was applied , these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49 . 1 to a mean postoperative value of 91 . 1 after a mean follow - up of 24 . 6 months .    3.347282071243568
in all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted .    2.898038162270488
in one case , a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease .    3.102931478911956
at follow - up , all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch , reduction of forefoot abduction , and restored arch height .    3.080740225400699
all patients were able to fully weight - bear the operated foot , and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result .    2.916030174013113
in the pes UNK deformity occurring in stage ii to iii ( as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred ) , osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics , thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function .    3.191033056178868
by the update of UNK a of the german road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be UNK even in absence of an actual driving impairment .    3.420936669330559
the only UNK is the detection of certain drugs / metabolites in a blood sample .    4.068516472017666
therefore for UNK there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood / serum .    3.489094734959927
the new mahsan UNK enzyme immunoassay ( mtp - eia ) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix .    2.861287290454579
for an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from mahsan ( mtp - eia ) and the routinely used abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay ( fpia ) with a UNK of routine serum samples .    3.2222191992319384
for the mtp - eias we used the cut - off recommendations of the UNK ( cannabinoids 2 ng / ml , opiates 10 ng / ml ) .    3.032101889940728
for the abbott UNK the serum samples had to be pretreated ( UNK with acetone ) and appropriate cut - UNK were defined by our investigations ( cannabinoids 20 ng / ml , opiates 30 ng / ml ) .    3.1043427047970615
out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42 % were positive with gc - ms and 18 % from 123 samples were positive for opiates .    2.9483057318255685
the abbott cannabinoid fpia gave false negative results in 23 % of gc - ms positive cases and 9 % false negatives for opiates while mahsan mtp - eia gave no false negatives .    2.914549573641311
each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13 % of the cases and for the mtp opiate assay 2 % of the positives could not be confirmed with gc - ms . as a result of our study the cut - off values for the mtp - eias have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives .    3.741970289863668
systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by UNK .    3.061826968788815
seven cases have been reported to date .    3.3152147885150702
we give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30 - year - old italian man .    3.3903805658651227
bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells , schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and , less obviously , in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels , in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain .    3.3416747794797854
these findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis , nonspecific UNK , adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple UNK .    3.2986855857857855
the clinical course was marked by chronic renal failure , chronic haemodialysis and renal transplantation .    3.123300325871218
the patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic - toxic shock .    3.2378295422322276
the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed .    3.2192230290192154
17 % of malignant melanomas ( n = 100 ) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter ( median diameter : 4 . 0 + / - 0 . 9 mm ) .    3.584941236973005
the essential epiluminescence microscopic and UNK features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions , although their clinical criteria differed from the classic UNK .    3.1116857817634083
6 ( 35 , 3 % ) of the small melanomas were were found to be in situ .    4.743302742078591
this percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger ( 38 , 3 % ) .    3.358425496880881
the remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from clark ' s level i to v , including all classic histogenetic types ( superficial spreading , nodular , UNK , desmoplastic ) .    3.1626219045620956
the median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0 , 76 + / - 0 , 23 mm .    3.567835715167597
7 small melanomas had apparent histologic remnants of a melanocytic nevus .    2.936093978634288
epiluminescence microscopic features of the melanomas were evaluated and statistically compared with those of 100 dysplastic nevi and 50 spindle cell nevi .    3.337534384768019
mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential .    3.2441185438012488
it is widely distributed in UNK and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons .    3.2467295535829717
in recent years , there have been numerous reports of infections by m . gordonae in immunocompromised patients .    2.8412003777703476
in contrast , only four cases of skin infections by m . gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published .    2.809958198037828
m . gordonae was isolated by tissue culture .    3.313771650544657
the skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with UNK for three months .    3.312078320381952
the article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors .    2.864254899429125
biochemical , UNK and molecular genetic findings are discussed .    4.435312970840164
it has been established , that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the UNK and the liver .    4.065286352956976
the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear , however .    3.3979090756334287
in particular , one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia .    2.7031385920740028
furthermore , organ - dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist .    2.955393874238109
oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs .    3.7803389298428063
the molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is , however , still unknown .    4.275011464144995
the authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor - specific mr contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function .    2.947909462971686
receptor specificity of mr contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor - specific carriers to ligands .    3.6271486643270414
this concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity .    3.4057793671956045
specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor - organ contrast and therefore tumor detection .    3.013913566577558
specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function .    3.1138028223761034
future design concepts of novel mr contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs ( UNK , adrenal glands , lymph nodes etc . )    3.2424414062419995
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers .    3.3655444290889696
UNK UNK UNK can arise as a rare complication in patients with down syndrome .    3.821178863315399
it is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by UNK elimination of abnormal elastic fibers .    3.505557378945061
this may reflect an immunological reaction UNK elastic fibers .    2.6657582630392365
we describe a 40 - year - old woman with down ' s syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time .    2.772938054219198
the position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot .    3.189200824459088
medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot .    3.4224288692858833
a large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones .    3.11754894458629
the most popular ones are dwyer ' s osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot , and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to evans .    2.9631914833486133
indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail .    3.688934417501056
the closing wedge osteotomy according to dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet .    3.473580381137357
in UNK the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems .    3.1663306044576167
in these cases an osteotomy according to mitchell with lateral displacement of the UNK UNK is more suitable .    3.695905091808867
in flat - and UNK a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to evans can be indicated , especially when the load of the foot is UNK medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot .    3.144554230348412
between january 1994 and august 1998 , 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis UNK .    2.90664401713995
one patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides .    2.9637323552999892
in all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection .    3.9600086870252333
the average duration of infection was 8 . 3 months .    3.4118459762097215
the patients had undergone an average of 3 . 8 operations .    3.9004347612665273
follow up investigation occured 2 . 5 years ( 1 . 5 - 4 . 7 ) after flap transfer .    4.111505519410526
the flap is easy to harvest .    3.643137258448185
he has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation .    3.03758643881447
the functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal .    2.974995592862395
that vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region .    3.0077481074414663
information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and , therefore , new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics .    3.420422854742373
a german law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to UNK the different strategies .    3.6303626551511194
all UNK to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set .    3.010956509034853
nevertheless , local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases .    2.8830458020172327
financial support and political work is therefore needed .    3.6209594346476948
to UNK the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis .    3.2919279522620077
this includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials , human placenta and the rat model .    3.2722152553123083
the most important role in this concept is played by the placenta .    3.304014597589697
it supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis .    2.984642623263239
as to availability , handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept .    3.0354132722460827
since manfred bleuler ' s description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago , debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid , independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset .    3.390349180806092
as this review shows , this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now .    3.170031036487937
it must rather be UNK that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since manfred bleuler ' s comprehensive contribution , nor managed to achieve a much UNK basis UNK .    2.8474065292648154
the reasons for this are the international conceptual and UNK confusion that has developed around this illness group , and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far .    3.1907546633698978
definition of the problem : in parallel with public and philosophical discussions , there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in UNK ethics .    2.9584396514065507
in this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements .    3.2915199169891145
arguments : a short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms .    3.4075714238015418
the second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps : the level of principles , the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences .    3.265887612370765
the third part presents some reflections following the UNK ethical tradition ( the ethics of a good life and death ) focusing on the central question : how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering .    3.0570403979436613
conclusion : it would be UNK to UNK the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life , especially the meaning of dignity , autonomy and UNK of human life , and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia .    3.575747927276683
in this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death .    2.9120427155844233
multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy .    4.036750296792091
despite the combination of all three therapeutic options , there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain .    3.750823150650512
recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor UNK gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures .    3.3289566106735484
inactivation of the gene may be an important determinant of the UNK of today ' s multimodal therapy protocols .    4.38823705115569
in 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy .    3.367257350681634
from all patients , biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53 .    3.574013401247122
after radiation treatment , 51 patients ( 57 % ) showed a complete response ; 39 patients ( 43 % ) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all .    3.4164559868490314
among the responders , 82 % of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive , whereas among the UNK only 56 % of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive .    3.0113991990266302
the majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment .    2.70397752991062
in our study , detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more UNK reaction of the tumors .    3.1732863631811243
nevertheless , successful strategies for radiation therapy may need to take into account the tissue of origin and the status of p53 in the tumor .    3.4760252888056598
the human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life , well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components .    3.043046750973632
in different joint diseases , it becomes UNK and the destruction of the cartilage UNK the repair .    3.9744879719483763
in tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix , these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids , in the synovial fluid , and then in the blood and the UNK , where they can be detected .    4.135772181827272
the quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids .    3.6727031361393223
the research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis , the disease severity rather than its presence or absence , the prognosis , and the response to therapy .    4.096226457477196
they should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level .    3.4771093545157137
the specific cartilage matrix markers promise to become useful tools in the future in clinical use .    3.3397329816230448
the research in this area is still in the early stages , with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s .    3.7143138189723217
axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm .    3.8616930255410127
in our hospital , with many UNK in anaesthesia , only 250 - 300 axillary blocks per year are performed by about 30 colleagues .    3.138172777267071
this implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist .    3.3307416029965986
the present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions .    2.8917143519860757
we used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist ' s experience in this technique .    2.821846173890874
the study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity ; all received an axillary block .    3.026975920661195
we used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1 % without adrenaline .    2.4272109085300437
sensory blockade was assessed by the UNK method ( no blockade , analgesia , anaesthesia ) ; motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms ( no blockade , paresis , paralysis ) .    3.201666406965013
data were analyzed using the mann - whitney test , with p < 0 . 05 considered statistically significant .    2.941255153808901
of the 112 blocks , 95 ( 85 % ) were successful ; 17 ( 15 % ) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia .    3.4903286042691155
eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after > = 70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia .    3.0847936642683016
we found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block .    3.3862788553385244
the minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was 0 . 4 ma and differed significantly from the value of 0 . 6 ma in the failure group ( table 3 ) .    3.398015893739796
the dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group ( 5 . 9 vs . 5 . 3 mg / kg ) .    3.562985369205185
the frequency of complete sensory blockade ( anaesthesia ) had increased by 21 . 9 % between the 20th and UNK min .    3.419973766903606
complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade ( fig .    2.9671362808382717
using the method of electrostimulation , the axillary block is an appropriate anaesthetic technique that can be applied in a hospital where each anaesthetist only occasionally UNK it .    3.790808065056108
prior to injection of the local anaesthetic , the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to < 0 . 5 ma .    3.8173737609204665
the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery should be no less than 30 min because complete sensory blockade can more often be achieved .    3.4654553287979404
the dose of mepivacaine should be no less than 6 mg / kg body weight .    2.7916936976026
vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels .    3.2270705491465197
numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults .    3.1854681139695775
it is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia .    2.9593908275259992
these properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease .    2.9669150019507335
five vegf forms of 121 to 206 amino - acids are produced from a single gene by alternative UNK .    2.969879126179868
cells expressing vegf usually express several forms simultaneously .    3.012337015083466
vegf121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability .    3.3431861572188426
however , this form is fully active as an UNK of angiogenesis , and as a blood vessel UNK agent .    3.522229515803327
exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains .    3.451043901380764
the vegf form containing exon 7 ( vegf165 ) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 ( vegf145 ) display similar biological UNK raising the question of why so many vegf forms are required .    3.039029146680214
it was found that vegf121 UNK better because it does not bind to UNK - sulfate proteoglycans .    2.965932175446986
in contrast , vegf145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly .    2.503771479176047
when the receptor binding properties of vegf121 and vegf165 were compared it was found that vegf165 binds to a class of vegf receptors that is not recognized by vegf121 .    2.8853019860915343
these receptors are encoded by the neuropilin - 1 gene , and we have recently found that the related neuropilin - 2 gene also UNK a vegf165 receptor .    3.203911304146354
we have recently found evidence indicating the UNK form complexes with another vegf receptor , UNK - 1 .    3.5489017920925727
however , the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated .    3.2016536290062603
in addition to mucositis and UNK as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors , late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem .    3.0215347324860224
the healing of wounds by secondary intention is a simple method to close operative defects .    3.462593983392308
the quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the defect .    3.787006709325969
best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave geometry and when the defect lies UNK at the interface of two anatomic subunits .    3.3805221002743546
partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention .    2.9350177312609316
this simple and efficient operative procedure is UNK by two case reports .    3.8787870489001026
background : acute infectious UNK ( im ) is a UNK lymphoproliferative disease of ebv - infected ( UNK ) b cells and poly - / oligoclonal cytotoxic t cells which are to a high percentage ebv - specific .    3.721590935374936
in b cells ebv infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of ebv nuclear antigens 1 - 6 ( UNK - 6 ) and membrane antigens 1 , 2a and 2b ( UNK , UNK and UNK ) .    3.7928257887079817
here we examined if also lytic ebv genes ( i . e .    2.6354734789977186
UNK ) , which are associated with a productive ebv infection , are expressed during im .    4.019058575970434
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( arvcm ) is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) and sudden death .    3.3273746798654567
treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death .    3.077423749364763
in a minority of patients with progressive arvcm and clinical signs of heart failure , pharmacological treatment with vasodilators , diuretics , and digitalis may be required .    3.5377969462099
a prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound ( us ) , computed tomography ( ct ) , and single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth .    3.5089333568060863
the typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after UNK exercise .    3.2741844386203907
ocular muscle involvement with UNK ( in 50 % ) and diplopia ( in 25 % ) are the most common initial signs .    4.431536730287083
the disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles ( generalized myasthenia ) .    2.986752734784286
the muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can UNK to a diagnosis of UNK .    3.4731034314572784
since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease .    3.9018730752615296
also , a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy .    4.285662613446667
the mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability .    3.4335249032077937
the injection of edrophonium ( UNK ) , the UNK testing after UNK stimulation ( decrement test ) and the testing for serum antibodies against UNK receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia .    4.514486343862463
the edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases .    2.9904009363775153
antibodies are present in 50 % of ocular myasthenia and in 80 - 90 % of the generalized form .    4.001373453063356
the lambert - eaton myasthenic syndrome , other neuromuscular diseases , mitochondrial diseases , diseases of the cranial nerves , UNK and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis .    3.624107890022001
the application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and UNK - UNK .    3.404271782172664
they offer a great deal of innovative ideas .    3.100996615905523
best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures .    3.22923348429378
when using 2 , 7 mm UNK primary mechanical UNK of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1 , 8 mm k - wires .    3.202197692301239
a prospective and randomised study with two years follow up , including 183 radial head fractures , showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants .    3.4459823237997997
for this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended .    3.1492320020162294
despite the more extensive UNK device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant .    2.8530050136280103
UNK - UNK polyactide screws showed good clinical results , UNK resorption was extremely late within 5 to 7 years .    3.206932657791386
the treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every UNK surgeon .    3.0666759649947313
the UNK for regeneration of cartilage tissue is minimal and leads to mechanically inferior fibrous tissue .    3.129194060979671
the established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis .    3.198209173411164
autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to UNK a full thickness cartilage UNK with hyaline - like cartilage .    3.521183802130812
outcome studies with a follow up from 2 - 10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella .    3.9073446861748735
mechanical testing of the UNK cartilage showed almost UNK stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage .    3.8273089226797654
the available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well - trained surgeons .    3.2442019338556625
result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis .    3.393136515579188
vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels .    3.6187623479201307
according to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process , the clinical presentation and the histological appearance , different UNK syndromes may be distinguished .    4.207712491306655
primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs , malignancy or infection .    3.051655701504843
panarteriitis UNK caused by chronic hepatitis b and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic hepatitis c are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections .    3.0654012886386153
however , these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis .    3.194095428442834
in numerous case reports , various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis , either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction .    3.346108383468735
immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient ' s immune system .    3.960545676924259
after successful treatment of the infection , the vasculitis usually UNK .    3.162204510238965
therefore , all patients with vasculitis should be evaluated for underlying infection .    3.854601954171032
to calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by UNK of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre - and postoperative computed UNK of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by UNK ( universal spine system ) .    3.4445541631875973
our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the UNK fragments which was performed in all 32 cases .    4.3034480628649385
we found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area ( UNK preoperatively 55 % , postop .    2.8678642037328923
80 % ) and midsagittal diameter ( msd preop .    3.3454823822124404
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit , no neurological deterioration occured .    3.3265049097808097
fractures with neurological deficit showed more canal compromise ( 52 % ) and less midsagittal diameter ( msd compromise 51 % ) than those without ( 40 % or 39 % ) .    3.2889151756884836
there was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit .    3.2187078251312617
below l 1 the spinal canal is greater than between th 11 and l 1 , so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated .    3.2629762745418844
in case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis : an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is UNK .    3.148481859067989
in fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long - term UNK such as UNK and claudicatio spinalis .    3.33480343720473
in common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury .    3.822270582743253
an exact diagnosis is mandatory as well as a differentiated therapy .    3.79092973984061
especially the correct decision about the therapy ( operative vs conservative ) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon .    3.3667527987158725
these patients should be transferred to a specialised centre .    3.4431014693915456
the intensity of dna degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time .    3.643716001437238
the aim of this study was the investigation of dna degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues ( muscle , brain , liver , bone ) and with different formalin concentration ( 2 % , 4 % , 8 % ; UNK ) .    3.3866451639247073
an additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using pcr analysis .    3.273838290183162
the smallest amounts of dna were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone .    3.079764360750284
the amount of dna that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration , while at the same time dna degradation increased .    3.282676598137647
with the pcr - UNK system UNK 01 , all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration .    3.303553087006718
the draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata , acne fulminans , acne UNK , rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans ( pyoderma faciale ) .    2.4767020012695244
the lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression .    3.0938241669645543
histopathologically , it consists of elaborate , epithelialized UNK connected to the skin surface at multiple points .    3.1800529975635734
it contains corneocytes , hairs , bacteria , serum , inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas .    2.931109152059053
a surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus UNK can be studied .    3.7750904770276814
intralesional corticosteroid injection , cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective .    3.328330458207866
sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary .    3.916871230073781
the draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst .    2.6789744519628163
instead , it is a soft - tissue disease , where the UNK and t1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura .    3.7655352800662745
thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis .    3.9636815769604237
if surgery is recommended , it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib .    3.8599369443424196
transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications .    4.234695909174708
among these , brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one .    3.4176702518929614
objective : the objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non - cancer pain in germany and austria .    4.045066386555885
methods : in june 1997 a questionnaire was sent to UNK german and austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy .    2.781337843843384
questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked .    4.279055464409636
results : the response rate was 23 % .    2.974256193015926
the data show that 78 % of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain .    3.395023251704371
local anaesthetics are used by 85 % of these anaesthesiologists , followed by morphine ( 72 % ) , clonidine ( 48 % ) , buprenorphine ( 34 % ) , baclofen ( 20 % ) , fentanyl ( 13 % ) and sufentanil ( 10 % ) .    4.606676979671059
for most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used , again followed by opioids und clonidine .    3.3024555558567417
in the 137 answering pain clinics 79 . 821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year .    2.739874530818482
discussion : epidural and intrathecal pain therapy is frequently used in germany and austria , either as a complementary or alternative treatment to systemic pain therapy .    3.185844886585561
local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment .    3.185947206950349
for some of the applied substances UNK data are lacking .    3.650161395480528
the use of these substances has to be considered very carefully .    3.3513128562305434
UNK conduction disturbances ( iacd ) are the known substrate of re - UNK atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy .    3.609608092290113
signs of iacd can be missed on the standard ecg , and signal averaged ( sa ) p wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological ( eps ) properties of atrial myocardium .    3.1434118765929946
unfavourable eps effects of raa pacing are known to UNK , but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice , and raa based pacing modes remain standard even for pts .    3.2752995387035266
we examined and compared eps effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools : UNK obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system ( via telemetry ) and time domain analysis of sa p wave in 22 pts .    2.727258620523816
with bia pacing system ( implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and iacd ) .    2.965403855590282
the results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently : raa pacing UNK iacd in comparison to sinus rhythm ; the effects of cs pacing is less visible .    2.9196795005764424
bia pacing UNK all atrial activation times .    3.413577278299484
the normalisation of sa p wave duration , reduction of sa p wave dispersion , increasing of rms 20 and decreasing of las 5 and finally UNK of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts .    2.9741488631986477
indicates beneficial effects of bia pacing ( in pts .    3.52969967112167
with iacd ) in comparison to sinus rhythm and raa pacing .    3.491984964276293
unfavourable eps effects of raa pacing in patients with iacd indicates suitability the need for alternative ( UNK ) atrial pacing modes .    3.9377923606573018
time domain analysis of sa p wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non - invasive evaluation of eps effects of different modes of atrial pacing .    3.1965770033759724
background : we report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia .    3.0443762419837253
on account of the spatial distance , there is no danger of UNK the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery .    3.469012111018542
however , in the UNK and anaesthesiological literature , some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation , use of the laryngeal mask airway , bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported .    3.3046923991765826
the endoscopic guided puncture tracheostomy has established itself in many intensive care units .    2.776094435316663
manufacturers offer complete tracheostomy kits , based on the described techniques from UNK ( cook - set ) , as well as from UNK ( UNK - set ) .    4.138520743705792
chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis may occur in children , adolescents and adults , but has not been found in newborns or babies either in our series or in the literature .    3.587908838658818
symptoms suggesting an acute disease like fever are uncommon , but a primary chronic course with symptomatic and asymptomatic periods is typical .    3.0795753829350874
pain and swelling are the main symptoms ; painless masses are rare .    3.53656614814236
in children and adolescents the clavicle and metaphyseal regions of long bones are typical sites of chronic UNK osteomyelitis .    3.0792399229734664
laboratory findings are non - specific but important for the differential diagnosis .    3.19108189685065
the sedimentation rate and c - reactive protein might be elevated .    3.1196681319070922
the x - ray examination shows osteolytic , sclerotic or mixed bony changes and , in case of a diaphyseal involvement , UNK periosteal bone formation may be present , suggesting a malignant process .    3.240853841704577
in late stages sclerotic bone formations may be seen as a rest .    2.9016035104977043
uni - or multifocal lesions can be detected by UNK , as can asymptomatic lesions .    4.014414942586896
magnetic resonance imaging shows gross signal intensity differences both in the bone and perifocal soft tissue and involvement of the synovium with gadolinium UNK enhancement in t1 - weighted images .    3.162725824920642
in early stages of the disease granulocytes , UNK and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology .    3.6038985886414032
in intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found , whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically .    3.1774668838026345
in chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis , all clinical , radiological and histological findings , as well as negative bacteriological cultures , are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made .    3.143540030497265
the disease may be uni - or multifocal , and new bone lesions may occur over time , as well as skin manifestations , which can be found years before or after bone involvement .    3.769247121563693
the association with dermatological diseases and / or synovitis led to the UNK UNK syndrome ( synovitis , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteomyelitis ) .    4.032482820294057
for the treatment non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief , reduction of swelling and dysfunction .    3.377682943343355
antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective .    4.034799857736435
major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences , and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years .    4.0786441315814645
a woman with severe stiff - man syndrome showed UNK cardiovascular dysregulation .    3.139076901149897
the blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5 - 10 min .    3.4802488216725496
this rhythm was also maintained after relaxation .    3.273723414286227
it is UNK that spinal UNK mechanisms are responsible for the tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system .    3.0602161045616265
the frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid - UNK and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer ( n = 113 ; UNK - 3 , pn0 - 1 , UNK , r0 ) were investigated ; the prognostic value was compared with pt and pn stage , grading and UNK ' s tumor classification with cox ' s multivariate regression - model .    3.706623314020403
sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases ( n = 113 ) .    4.147910375703243
statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present ; they were independent of pt stage , histological tumor type , tumor grading , and the clinical course of disease .    3.4656833258779414
microcarcinosis ( defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or UNK without adjacent stromal reaction ) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pn0 cases ; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value .    3.240698345083591
in microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis , the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value .    4.293594097273863
in pn1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value .    3.545820236050033
microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis .    3.199650507988976
this article summarizes the most important results of the turku conference on active strategies for an aging UNK , which took place in turku / finland in 1999 .    3.193519257682339
about 140 experts from all eu - member states participated .    2.9548452757499355
the article can be seen as a contribution to the current change in the debate on labor market policy concerning older workers in germany .    3.220351584366405
the incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0 . 2 % to 4 . 9 % .    4.528691507534986
ninety per cent of these were associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease , where vessel UNK and poststenotic dilatations are not an infrequent finding .    3.470560611585311
we present the case of a 67 year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery .    3.5022565136396957
the patient was symptomatic and had a posterolateral myocardial infarction .    2.9788249291475197
we performed a ptca and stent - implantation of the stenosis and coronary artery aneurysm of the right coronary artery .    3.1918077686229154
after the procedure , the patient could be discharged without angina pectoris .    3.4322544367095102
a control - angiography will be performed six months later .    3.2143772610019696
tmlr ( transmyocardial laser revascularization ) is a disputed UNK technique available in europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber .    3.1765653055850978
goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions : are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels ?    3.5079421929679584
we examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after tmlr .    3.8115857829811683
channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope .    3.685025021077332
laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 µm thick .    3.242065138322581
despite UNK removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks .    3.070741506330185
open UNK channels can be shown in all patients .    3.2297037201519356
these channels communicate with intramural vessels , but in no instance with chamber lumen .    3.212809777206586
our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood .    3.3001356277713403
additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium .    3.016637486182592
however , our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased .    3.0222216629617757
if similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after tmlr remains open .    3.364031870188609
recurrent miscarriages are , like sporadically occurring UNK , often ( approx .    3.0178426671165344
50 % ) due to chromosomal aberrations .    3.917647631337542
an undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological UNK .    3.5432268291659024
the initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal hla systems ( hla UNK ) is most likely incorrect .    3.3246996987772377
nevertheless , the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes .    3.211570002819038
several placebo - controlled studies have been performed .    3.3354936181341777
due to the small number of cases , results were not significant .    3.1672759890500424
a metaanalysis of all studies , however , proves significant effects of the active immune therapy .    3.5167605286088253
the risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins ( ivig ) .    3.362504699518511
this therapy , however , is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy .    3.1190185113907116
in a metaanalysis of all published results , ivig was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo .    3.2718826930099922
the indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions , after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions .    3.043272454894879
it appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy .    2.9049613861536527
UNK the concept of immune therapy is still under debate , alternative concepts are not available .    3.471248330073488
hence , new therapeutic approaches are also not available .    3.0926955517130645
the first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available .    3.1850804659836527
our new tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss ( snhl ) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer .    3.43333174103584
to avoid hearing losses during implantation , the tübingen piezotransducer will be ( 1 ) fixed to the mastoid cavity and ( 2 ) positioned to one of the ossicular target points .    3.736530209929413
this can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity .    2.950045046254178
the manipulator weights 0 . 7 g . with four degrees of freedom , it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer ' s probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions .    3.0539275692011985
the main advantages of the present micromanipulator are ( 1 ) easy handling during surgery , ( 2 ) the transducer ' s precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom , and ( 3 ) the transducer ' s stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position .    3.435616100647876
following integrated safety as the leading principle , ossicular or inner ear injuries caused , e . g . , by the patient ' s head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon , are minimized .    3.1445183481335985
the micromanipulator is , as it were , the surgeon ' s vibration - free " artificial hand " .    3.492963397000178
the manipulator ' s development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail .    2.882137864181204
while coupling the transducer to the body of the incus , transducer , microphone , and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76 % of all mastoid cavities without protrusion .    3.1336882827616757
in the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus , the protrusion - free implantation rate of the above - mentioned three implant modules is 78 % .    3.0010898262475414
the role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment .    3.409402202427676
computed tomography ( ct ) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims .    3.563533496663746
although magnetic resonance imaging ( mr ) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than ct , due to the ease and speed of ct , and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with ct than with mr , mean that mr is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work - up .    3.59587026392106
recent mr techniques such as flair or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of mr in head trauma .    3.224948934577815
conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions ( e . g .    2.8626514032541
traumatic arterio - venous fistulas , vascular dissections ) .    2.872772043672052
injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint .    3.8613662880523525
today we are often confronted with an UNK and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions .    3.599783591500705
additionally , the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results .    3.326660548147609
therefore , the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics , injury mechanisms and UNK , based on our experiences and data from the international literature .    3.5899452359948243
a further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques .    3.607527654211373
we also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results .    3.495865005569647
sevoflurane , like all currently used volatile anaesthetics , is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents .    2.822559801781857
the most significant UNK is a UNK known UNK as " compound a " .    4.136767177022649
compound a is nephrotoxic in rats and , at higher doses , in UNK primates , causing proximal tubular necrosis .    3.416686035805954
there has been much interest in the potential for compound a toxicity in humans .    3.079499348282953
inhaled compound a concentrations are greatest at low flow rates , high sevoflurane concentrations , UNK absorbent , barium hydroxide vs soda lime , and UNK absorbent .    3.2795772417250486
typical inspired compound a concentrations during low - flow and closed - circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8 - 24 and 20 - 32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime , respectively .    2.989577111962657
investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low - flow sevoflurane , low - flow isoflurane or high - flow sevoflurane .    3.89301554417448
there have been no case reports of compound a - associated renal injury in humans .    2.93245765634647
in volunteers , one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers , while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers .    2.9272011904527484
the mechanism of compound a nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine UNK , and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans .    3.1126905545097
in the report of the 1995 world health federation / international society and federation of cardiology ( UNK / isfc ) task force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies , the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated .    3.150656248390041
idiopathic , autoimmune , and infectious forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy are now recognized in this definition .    3.3190327260893167
UNK , UNK and UNK are considered as main UNK factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease .    3.8797668882845366
we report our experience in managing a temporal bone fracture after head trauma that had no apparent clinical signs .    2.757760269089522
recurrent csf UNK and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures .    3.058656638330074
the location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment , facial paralysis , vertigo or tinnitus .    2.972430612578066
only csf liquorrhea through the eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base .    3.153749804674864
hyperkeratosis UNK UNK ( UNK ' s disease ) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis .    3.837087580131768
we report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation .    2.851156593716487
in this context , a good response to calcipotriol , a synthetic vitamin d3 derivative is of particular interest .    2.826355972864719
pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life - threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations .    3.22245869166247
diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation / perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography .    2.884711179904728
both methods , however , carry substantial drawbacks .    3.897773237267298
therefore , clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non - invasive diagnostic modality .    3.491459336889105
spiral ct of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality , that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth - order branches .    3.19923810835322
this paper reviews the technical aspects , typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique .    2.7516145067659226
the potential role of spiral ct in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented .    4.0650384859988415
introduction : interleukin - 12 - p70 ( il - 12 - p70 ) is a potent UNK cytokine composed of a heavy chain ( p40 ) and a light chain ( UNK ) .    3.3588958295330165
UNK results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of il - 12 after polytrauma .    4.193610324386205
methods : we daily analyzed systemic concentrations of il - 12 in polytrauma patients ( n = 37 , mean iss 33 . 9 ) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by elisa .    3.248972190978759
patients were divided according to their mean il - 12 levels into those with elevated il - 12 ( group 1 , n = 7 ) , those with decreased il - 12 ( group 2 , n = 4 ) and those with il - 12 in the normal range ( group 3 , n = 26 ) .    3.833064389606632
results : patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of il - 12 up to p70 > 1000 pg / ml and p40 > 2500 pg / ml .    3.203388303626764
the common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia ( 85 % survivors ) .    3.143897201741854
patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma ( group 3 ) showed normal il - 12 values .    3.153969677642624
patients with decreased il - 12 levels revealed also a thorax trauma and pneumonia but all patients UNK .    2.9148081679724975
the groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit , in tiss , in mods score and in respiratory ratio , but not in iss , mean crp values and leukocyte counts .    3.231427621483616
correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between UNK altered il - 12 values and clinical parameters , with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and iss ( r = - 0 . UNK ) or mods score ( r = - 0 . UNK ) in group 1 .    3.655281273488965
conclusions : after major injuries there is no overall suppression of il - 12 formation .    3.6185106352254977
patients with normal or elevated il - 12 levels belong mainly to the survivors , whereas patients with decreased il - 12 levels are at high risk of UNK to multi - organ failure .    3.0544696003722014
this article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome .    2.7117380145275733
shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon UNK the UNK arch , mainly in forward flexion of the arm .    3.747892313735627
different stages of impingement syndrome are described .    3.024748471479391
stage i relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon .    3.0685164899663246
in stage iii there is a tear of the rotator cuff .    4.157689234342846
moreover , calcifying tendinitis , fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome .    2.78157311643893
imaging is important for the exact diagnosis .    3.9575855224409557
standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome .    3.4598650748294357
they may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity , subacromial spurs , and form anomalies of the acromion .    3.042590857458547
they are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis , fractures and neoplasm .    3.0018415790979573
ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors .    3.6010228176957373
however , there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears .    3.051305448436223
its usefulness has therefore been questioned .    3.2554936938409527
mr imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures .    3.328356176659974
several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings , such as tendinopathy versus partial tears , may be difficult with mr imaging .    3.6079418794480236
however , reproducibility for full - thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography .    3.1410162125484065
moreover , specificity appears to be superior to sonography .    3.4000316484796063
mr arthrography is not UNK accepted .    3.5043725884027923
however , it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning .    3.304125288094967
standard arthrography and ct have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff .    4.125423466828014
gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type ( according to UNK ) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only .    3.681500995097453
over the past 18 years , we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type , accounting for 3 . 6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas .    3.8410877486751525
macroscopically they were classified as UNK iv or iii , while histologically most of them were well differentiated .    3.4871025115039567
histologically , these tumours retained the pre - existing structures of the stomach , most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria ; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic , particularly in the submucosal and UNK layers .    2.9677605368724143
in all cases the tumour tissue spread inside lymphatic vessels .    2.7371333811378467
all but 2 cases with UNK involved lymph nodes , often small , showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus ; in three quarters of cases the UNK was infiltrated by the tumour .    3.8536060057711694
significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom UNK ii operation had been performed .    3.078302784905306
the mean survival time of 16 patients was 14 . 9 months .    3.4916680121639594
owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth , extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of UNK ring cell cancer .    3.6033640856780162
the high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging .    3.475402490249847
preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult , because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification .    3.334075663771516
close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary , and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the UNK importance .    4.284119838485095
one rare case of so - called massive idiopathic osteolysis UNK - UNK is presented .    3.9986236044027867
in a 77 - year - old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2 . 5 month following trauma .    3.4719164381575833
as a histologic cause for the osteolysis , a marked stimulation of UNK on the spongiosa , especially UNK , was observed .    3.5617417406445506
the course and the clinical findings are described , and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature .    5.105747561674652
the results suggest that an early UNK therapy ( calcitonin , UNK ) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes .    3.63629719739605
in this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client - centered therapy is discussed .    2.7024786456625964
UNK is UNK said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue .    3.2091425833256015
if one UNK psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic , and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts , then a comprehensive ' status diagnosis ' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory - led client - centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy .    3.0168625465982015
client - centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which ' assumed diagnoses ' ( embedded in the therapist ' s ' empathic knowledge ' ) are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience UNK to understand and change his ' diagnosis ' .    3.0479366268262185
this is the main finding to diagnose segmental ( articular ) dysfunction .    2.828424356873809
normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end .    3.388407263912936
in contrary , the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction , i . e . restriction of joint facet gliding .    3.0385342575031116
multiple intra - and UNK lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland , including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations .    3.3907216582113984
in the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes .    3.1518168905984973
except for the frequently occurring warthin tumours , primary salivary gland tumours , which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes , are rare .    3.423938078405806
examples of these are adenomas ( pleomorphic adenoma , basal cell adenoma ) and carcinomas ( acinic cell carcinoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma , sebaceous gland carcinoma ) .    2.7828903940661007
three of our own observations ( sebaceous UNK , acinic cell carcinoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma ) are analysed .    2.8737755288457945
the condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour - free and that no other occult carcinoma is present .    3.486111593277427
we report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding .    2.724845598856481
precocious UNK due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed .    3.8442711843132193
within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed .    3.407525143516364
elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously .    3.110332313780136
after having given informed consent , 40 patients ( age range from 20 to 60 years ) with an active irritant contact dermatitis ( icd ) , 40 patients in whom icd had cleared , as well as 40 healthy volunteers serving as controls were tested .    3.594562928917429
the skin responses to sls were assessed both visually and by measurement of UNK water loss ( tewl ) as an indicator of stratum UNK integrity .    2.9723234402992964
sls significantly increased the erythema scores and tewl in patients with healed icd , and the increase of tewl was even more pronounced in patients with active icd .    4.4073391127661665
by contrast , a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active icd only but not in patients with healed icd .    4.023409089730503
however , because of the relatively high interindividual variation , a cut - clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test .    3.1970490162375977
on the other hand , the art seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following icd .    2.69959062284179
introduction : the correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of UNK ( prk ) , while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy .    4.003613346762374
experience has shown that cataract surgery , using modern tunnel techniques with self - healing incisions , results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing .    3.3139645135384845
in this study , we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair - UNK t - incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy ( alk ) .    2.87167877586863
an often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication , mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care , is reactive acute cholecystitis .    3.1310585923417857
on account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis .    3.563196423983685
ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively , seven times on different days , in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months .    2.906292273672812
the results show that artificial respiration , parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to UNK ( 28 / 40 ) UNK or to a three - layered wall of the gallbladder ( 9 / 40 ) .    3.453345468898596
in 22 . 5 % of patients ( 9 / 40 ) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis .    3.9138684268315584
in correlation with the clinical signs , cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients .    3.7427041645160983
the preoperative UNK findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively .    3.617160170980691
we found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients .    3.1468221263172462
our study shows that the morphological correlate of a UNK three - layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations , even if there is no underlying cholecystitis .    3.6732789676982307
the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings .    3.2525388968429603
osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk .    3.71825915188897
the purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis .    2.9480930229987843
several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone , such as conventional radiography , high - resolution computed tomography ( hr - ct ) and high - resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( hr - mri ) .    3.8266410609678987
the best results were obtained using high - resolution tomographic techniques .    2.997031397329217
the highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using hr - mri .    2.862628857098038
these studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion .    2.818893780366726
combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis .    3.8010179829884
classification of cosmetics , which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents , is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists .    3.7517512066782417
their definition within the eu and the respective european directives , replacing national laws step by step , will be briefly presented .    2.782031005291721
the problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be UNK in detail by examples from clinical practice .    3.0269140970686683
finally , we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing " UNK " active cosmetics , and in the pharmaceutical industry towards " cosmetically " oriented medicinal products as part of a current " life - style " UNK .    3.1162578293913197
in some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents .    2.785751396992712
the decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy .    2.813374177999658
especially in medical expert UNK the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient .    3.275468265292447
the purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative UNK shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases .    2.9779691940041717
this study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were UNK in primarily acute , subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness .    2.9303059652378356
we considered the location of the tear , the shape and the size .    3.600810751052782
furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon , its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined .    3.063159243305482
the results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not .    3.3585840364719766
the isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is UNK for the trauma .    3.6430872479033254
in comparison with the degenerative study group the UNK and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study UNK for traumatic tears .    3.6855519337355185
health care decision making in UNK severely ill patients presents many difficult medical , ethical , and legal problems for the physician .    3.088880565917999
at the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions .    3.839657029647928
UNK ' s disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands .    3.145663929581537
the following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts .    2.9066091310096502
such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported .    3.085075015238669
the treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand .    3.1089887419854194
the application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters ' intrathoracic blood volume ' and ' extravascular lung water ' .    2.8898873777461076
this technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 french catheter in the femoral artery .    3.1010667832401975
additionally , controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient .    2.7830489442781143
therefore , the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload .    3.427403553001735
furthermore , the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used .    2.6942967290071067
hypnosis , autogenic training , progressive relaxation and UNK show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation - therapy and are useful techniques in psycho - or behavior - therapy .    3.008080559325958
though they share some aspects with body - oriented psychotherapy these relaxation - techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious UNK .    2.8717360916942893
though in details somewhat different , the methodology of these techniques creates a framework , in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited .    3.3059757255158475
however , regular practice of the patients is UNK .    3.9748953117962946
focussed attention , imagination and new UNK of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects , which may contribute to enhanced internal UNK and UNK .    3.3340607538164493
controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders ( e . g .    2.7891936056709565
headache , pain , UNK .    3.8351547966511177
as components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs , there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders ( e . g .    3.134356820505527
relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific - based component in the treatment of psychic , psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders , except psychosis .    4.038223465919283
juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in UNK by murray .    3.6868954159968697
major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy ; minor criteria include UNK , osteolytic lesions and a positive family history .    3.2704761495350723
a 35 - year - old woman suffering from crohn ' s disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the UNK of her hands and feet , as well as on her elbows and wrists .    3.552891497349705
the clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum .    2.564095334721381
no improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids .    4.257245581935769
in contrast , treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions .    2.8981575729180213
during a new attack of her crohn ' s disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions UNK again .    3.0339692499603617
the parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and crohn ' s disease , as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases , strongly suggest a common etiology .    3.449419339029099
this hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature .    3.302826787424514
the mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization , UNK on a cortical UNK and on a behavioral level .    3.4865083841646833
possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and UNK on somatosensory reorganization in humans .    3.827789782529094
the somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex .    3.126296347216813
changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing : on one side , limb amputation will result in a representational " invasion " of the UNK cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes .    3.2388473114752743
on the other side , sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb .    2.8201517657485926
plastic changes can be temporary or persistent .    3.313382516383993
UNK factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization .    3.1200882517555906
thus , specific physical training combined with UNK modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions .    3.0312702871426884
there have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) .    3.052260919545977
however , a substantial number of patients with ami who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options .    3.762792583467614
to describe the proportions , characteristics , and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective " maximal individual optimized therapy for acute myocardial infarction " ( UNK ) trial .    4.330448491751868
chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years , accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ - specific symptoms .    3.1827644575531386
people with any kind of UNK deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections .    3.4778701734111417
history , physical examination , laboratory tests , microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis .    3.403814767470815
the most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases , amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma .    2.6814636024866743
background : we perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil ( < 3 mm ) .    3.1655763618693293
we assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle .    3.0877087389988094
trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively UNK the severity of trauma victims ' injuries and physiologic derangements .    3.7173137893444115
they are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions .    3.3135101616130225
in the pre - clinical setting , an effective trauma index meets the following criteria : - it is highly reliable with regard to identifying high - and low - risk patients .    3.209183161060827
- it has high face - validity .    2.6961398460055648
- it has high inter - and intra - rater reliability .    2.763334891601507
- it is easy to use and allows rapid , accurate measurements .    3.091989166043871
the most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the injury severity score ( iss ) .    2.8378965445058997
it is calculated as the sum of the UNK of the three most severely injured body regions , and was originally developed as a means to UNK the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents .    3.803616204438469
the trauma score ( ts ) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity .    3.0659344930730885
it UNK the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions .    3.280680190686617
the recently developed mainz emergency evaluation score ( mees ) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs , including a pain scale , and has been designed as a dynamic score .    3.219151091408775
nevertheless , limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described .    3.233264466973381
mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring .    2.9854022779421316
in addition , intubated or UNK patients were excluded from outcome studies since the scoring systems UNK options for evaluation of pathophysiological conditions after therapeutic interventions .    3.140896630806084
thus , therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed , and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible .    2.925435272162541
the accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging , for example , " pain " as chosen in the mees must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult , especially when classifying unconscious patients .    3.0446741580411176
further criticisms of the above - mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim ' s age , gender , pre - injury health status , or the influence of alcohol or additional medication .    3.5038984097027264
if trauma indices in pre - hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches , significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed .    3.0973891212239923
resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices , since , e . g . , in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements .    3.1462172048933827
furthermore , a qualitative assignment of single vital - function parameters as crucial indices for a patient ' s condition never reflects the broad range of a patient ' s profile .    3.2618129669498153
many multiple - trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range , and the administration of analgesics or even pre - hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field .    3.7620886296684417
providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care , the mees has been developed as a dynamic scoring system .    3.9892432715077386
this design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an UNK criterion for future scoring systems .    3.4501887616845384
in view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine , pre - hospital indices do have limitations .    2.9154257533086003
the parameters " unknown patient " , time pressure , UNK measurements , lack of diagnostic facilities , incomplete evaluation , and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated .    3.0385531854367502
accurate prediction of outcome within early time - UNK is therefore not possible .    3.6697221223804393
ossification of the achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic , hypoxic injury of the tendon .    4.051653465244793
the usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma .    3.8975453390069896
we report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the achilles tendon .    3.471039962471875
because of the radiologically " occult " fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by mri .    3.0814391447282965
with a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery .    3.481998886131138
hair problems are UNK at the levels of information supply , trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment .    3.2807025706165835
the UNK represent a major health care challenge , and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community .    3.7176212638674504
they may pose a UNK problem for non - specialized physicians , who tend to UNK such complaints , although the patient ' s perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought .    3.455152668784269
perception of a hair problem is subject to UNK standards ; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for " UNK " and what is " healthy " and " UNK " , and the media provide an abundance of UNK information with respect to hair care .    3.644215010520682
patients with hair problems frequently UNK the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist .    3.4535760504148256
thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser ' s training qualifications .    2.878428129515468
besides manual , creative and psychological UNK , " trichological competence " relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders , recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required .    3.1358213135967046
to optimize the interaction between the physician , UNK and the media , more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable , with success depending on full identification of the set goals , qualification and UNK to the standards determined by the medical speciality .    3.8112247005283613
we reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small - cell lung cancer ( sclc ) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy .    3.033613714347828
adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was sclc before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two .    4.453685840995393
two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small - cell and adenocarcinomatous components , and five had only adenocarcinoma .    3.301959981356716
the interval between histological evidence of sclc and adenocarcinoma was 3 months - 5 years .    3.0710443403565293
from the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in sclc after chemotherapy : ( a ) a primarily UNK differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy , and ( b ) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of sclc , as patients with treated sclc are known to have an increased risk of non - sclc .    3.4244435857818045
however , therapy - induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely .    3.054840821225234
these findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of sclc to allow early and appropriate reaction to non - sclc components .    3.4386435935688646
demonstration of bdv - specific serum antibodies , the isolation of bdv from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients , and the recent demonstration of bdv antigen and bdv - rna in human brain tissue strongly suggest that bdv can infect humans .    3.2212298099262364
isolation of UNK virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof .    3.542993069803918
there is still great controversy about the question of whether bdv antigen , bdv - rna or bdv can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not .    3.076075074212639
overall , the question of UNK of bdv infection for humans is wide open .    3.376327573294949
investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that bdv might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so - called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases .    2.8214085874176784
UNK studies suggest a widely non - specific but possibly pathogenic role of bdv in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders .    3.1649791871292043
in a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and uva / b phototherapy to a uva / b mono - phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis ( ad ) .    2.9257782246617845
the patients in the balneophototherapy group ( n = 16 ) were treated with baths containing 3 - 5 % of the synthetic salt UNK - UNK , followed immediately by uva / b irradiation , while the other treatment arm ( n = 12 ) received uva / b phototherapy alone .    4.122294467919618
after 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant ( p < = 0 . UNK ) reduction of the scorad score from 69 . 5 before to 36 . 8 after therapy .    3.7302135901667386
no statistically significant reduction in the scorad score could be observed in the uva / b phototherapy group ( 50 . 6 before to 44 . 3 after therapy ) .    3.3732001123973654
the cumulative uvb dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group ( 0 . 9 j / cm2 ) as compared to the uva / b monotherapy group ( 2 . 0 j / cm2 ) .    3.5564938163489597
balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed .    3.1566106669893315
we conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis .    3.0950235140859794
five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate .    3.5719572637960053
head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected .    4.965823079960328
the functional and cosmetic disadvantages and UNK related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient .    3.2332428365214168
background and purpose : only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt - pa for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published .    3.3711170967912807
wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown , because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa in stroke ( ecass and ninds ) did not UNK assess the status of the extracranial vessels .    3.6766525375040504
introduction : chronic pain is an individually variable experience , incorporating physical , psychological and social dimensions .    3.172596396589581
chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity ; therefore , a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies .    3.443165403186819
it is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability .    3.0918372538929173
the traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions ( bankart lesion , hill - sachs lesion , UNK of the capsule ) , which are caused at the time of primary dislocation .    4.393561604748648
the quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the bankart lesion .    3.674357839085538
the stronger the capsule , the greater the external force has to be in order to UNK the resistance caused by the capsule .    4.389791439067666
the damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule .    3.396741675539182
in cases of atraumatic instability , secondary lesions are normally absent .    3.007448603136263
these instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule .    2.9562900099243885
when stabilizing , a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration : stability and function .    3.367104963767594
reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability .    3.5449954335283724
additionally , the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted .    3.1449454410895816
both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation .    3.395818184606728
in benign UNK , thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland .    3.482382062265495
there is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with graves ' disease .    3.3053751947661976
in germany , thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas .    3.0589933251560404
avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative UNK therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy .    3.154501415242888
in patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected UNK - proto - oncogene mutations , thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation .    2.7851925004302753
the UNK and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas .    3.6002144821469266
in patients with medullary carcinomas , persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure .    3.024794799090077
thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas .    4.896582282098945
the operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland .    3.534923086954161
UNK type i is an autosomal UNK inherited deficiency of UNK UNK resulting in accumulation of UNK and its degradation products ( UNK mainly ) .    4.1048784872771265
typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement .    3.964536717560806
there are three main forms of the disease : the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age .    3.030297376467647
experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults .    3.276981335701814
the present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures ( one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings ) .    3.1979249156796277
ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding ( sdb ) are only seldom mentioned in the literature .    2.976724413518268
however , if no sdb is present , no one will look for these structures .    3.022487783542104
in our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made : prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium .    3.171099723514882
6 car passengers ( age between 4 and 31 years ) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year .    3.5183517747665327
2 victims had UNK fractures with cerebral compression injuries .    3.3352613165877987
in 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present ; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases , but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury .    3.396400408891671
in 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious .    3.2350727192738273
in 5 cases ruptures of UNK bridging veins could be demonstrated .    2.7254628005678674
in one case ( survival for 3 days ) a minor sdb ( 20 ml ) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis ; another victim died at the scene .    3.182467181096619
the other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing sdb and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis .    2.9386582612912506
this combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and sdb is UNK .    3.1113169407320473
the frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature .    3.549512397673591
a rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the sdb in the presented cases .    3.7547162698797742
implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear , provided they are fully implantable .    3.268110318802545
accordingly , a comprehensive , interdisciplinary , combined project was initiated at the ent clinic of the university of tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids .    2.8205759626490954
a novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described .    3.3515897938543144
unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far , this transducer does not rely on the UNK principle but on a circle - shaped , UNK combination system consisting of a UNK disc and metal membrane .    3.33857922454498
the transducer can be UNK sealed and is designed for implantation into the mastoid .    3.4028102072058153
transfer of mechanical oscillations to an UNK in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements .    3.5461992895737566
the transducer is highly UNK with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range ( greater than 10 khz ) .    3.5117225450121494
below this resonance and down to low frequencies , the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm .    3.1099032826632214
at low and middle frequencies of up to 1 khz , these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound - pressure levels of around 90 db spl .    2.98404396760892
at higher frequencies of up to 10 khz , the output level increases to about 130 db spl .    3.2248314735774035
nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels ( less than 0 . 1 % ) throughout the whole transfer range .    3.350370813429907
particularly , this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss .    2.8819860136128708
in craniomaxillofacial traumatology , surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction , a surgeon ' s aim may interfere with the UNK visual pathway .    3.4013601487034673
precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders .    3.4312966869694863
in order to develop these strategies , knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma , primary radiological investigations , and further diagnostic measures are important .    3.2625133053767046
due to the difficulties in UNK testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions , we established flash - evoked visual potentials ( vep ) and the UNK ( erg ) as reliable electrophysiological methods to UNK specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact , even if pathological , but still present or absent .    3.223056118666689
case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not UNK mean irreversible vision loss .    2.8660110359950046
the electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography ( ct ) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma .    3.2189438038132
the results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and / or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage .    3.399574635600461
the conservative therapy of choice for the treatment of traumatic optic nerve lesions is the UNK - UNK regimen ( 30 mg UNK / kg bodyweight i . v .    4.027316577720785
and 5 . 4 mg / kg bodyweight / h i . v .    3.53548693692485
for the following 47 h ) .    3.1153716966376477
surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the UNK part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by ct .    3.7820446445526876
prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated .    3.7576447678043268
to fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery , sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required .    3.3150310205252707
there is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor , maturation of the cervix , and preterm rupture of the membranes .    3.707815675772462
at the fetal - maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the UNK on the fetal side and the UNK , myometrium , and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed .    3.8841146180686765
melatonin ( n - acetyl - 5 - UNK ) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans , produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by - adrenergic receptors .    3.6987135031011698
serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day , rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a . m . melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm , daily sleep induction , aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions .    2.891206575471114
furthermore , melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra - and intracellular free radical UNK .    2.8104990583950418
melatonin seems to UNK mainly UNK radicals , the most damaging of all free radicals .    3.461969939231314
melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e . g .    3.6177791315237484
atopic eczema , psoriasis and malignant melanoma .    3.0560096724337766
the influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect .    2.9049415855525433
topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of uv - erythema .    4.166362331122716
penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability UNK further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin .    2.9190090574678624
lung dust analyses were performed on tumor - free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors .    3.4314980515219755
the measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients ' occupation as stone mason .    3.681603784895562
no evidence supporting the correlation of increased chronic asbestos load of the lungs and the development of typical carcinoid tumors of the lung was found .    3.888357243560937
analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the department of surgery at the herz - UNK UNK , fulda , from 1990 to 1995 , showed that meniscal lesions were the most common ( n = 89 , 60 . 5 % ) .    4.153562646039216
the most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions .    3.3635931696440102
conversely , contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases ( 20 . 2 % ) , while de - novo lesions occurred in 29 cases ( 29 . 2 % ) .    3.422681225583165
a coincidence of meniscal injury with first - or second - grade cartilage damage was documented in 35 patients ( 39 . 3 % ) , whereas 54 patients ( 60 . 7 % ) had normal intra - articular cartilage .    4.051882365544381
cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy .    3.9598640351301406
the most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage - UNK .    2.9769682581043484
concerning patients ' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by oak score , the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function ( 65 . 2 % ) and showed good or excellent outcome in the oak score ( 88 . 8 % ) .    3.9630381928491127
patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.088709078295658
in conclusion , in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery , repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively .    3.471271531566221
however , patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit .    3.2530602018358548
the present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease - specific stress of eighty - six patients with psoriasis and fifty - eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the UNK clinic , UNK , germany .    3.733341306989085
in addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease , the patients were offered , practice in relaxation techniques , social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling .    3.373253287212108
the clinical change was assessed by pasi and scorad , respectively .    3.0246040720334832
the marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases ( UNK ) and a questionnaire for health - related control attributes ( UNK - s ) served as psychometric measures .    3.9403604989698273
patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre - post comparison .    3.564442483804177
social fears , avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups .    3.1846214782531375
patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes .    3.688684521860713
dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis .    3.799959087859747
treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60 - 70 % of patients .    3.5893896067088664
surprisingly , these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries , including germany .    2.864092589008952
the aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of hannover , which has about 1 . 1 million inhabitants .    3.484129618065036
in germany special prescription forms , i . e . triplicate forms , have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids .    3.38906345963233
at the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days .    3.096746251028364
for two observation periods of 6 months lasting from january to june 1988 and from january to june 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the aok hannover ( one of the major medical insurance companies ) were evaluated .    3.331052778098965
the reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis .    3.0349995781963206
the individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined , excluding , e . g . days of hospitalization .    3.2611476486990956
during the two observation periods only 16 . 2 % ( 1988 ) and 19 . 5 % ( 1991 ) of the practitioners in the region of hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients .    3.335744813008089
the majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine .    2.7334373152456846
in two - thirds of the patients , cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug .    3.3315847769845255
the total number of patients with a prescription for cancer pain was 164 in 1988 and 196 in 1991 .    3.265934103716743
altogether UNK prescription forms in 1988 and UNK prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients .    2.8966249685237186
applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient , only 36 . 0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32 . 1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days .    3.9683010707483524
the mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16 . 8 + / - 25 . 4 days in 1988 and 19 . 4 + / - 29 . 1 days in 1991 .    3.6858012492013112
our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain .    2.6092041382045434
taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer , only 14 . 5 % ( 1988 ) and 19 . 0 % ( 1991 ) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics .    3.40833189661833
comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed .    3.664571691762516
there are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment : many physicians as well as their patients are still UNK of the side effects of strong opioids .    4.188955469085064
therefore , it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue .    2.7694616289322895
the legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids .    3.0821726756043364
in 1993 the regulations were simplified ; nevertheless , this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners .    3.467431015092033
thus , further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs .    3.1250042066391153
the long - term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of merle - d ' aubigné and UNK ( pain , mobility , walking ) .    3.558472500236794
a 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma , present on the left side of her nose for two months .    3.487846672804447
after repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy , she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal .    3.018009195384735
this led to complete resolution within 5 weeks .    3.04714716634798
although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available , the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations .    3.5801749046293527
between january 1995 and june 1996 , 24 inpatients at our hospital ( mean age 55 . 6 years ) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy ( ect ) .    3.3397245866968204
clinical improvement was observed in 80 % of the patients , including those without risk factors ( nrg , n = 16 ) , as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases ( rg , n = 8 ) .    3.9166289644418772
during a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ect 7 patients ( 35 % ) relapsed .    3.5039712251684225
the rate of relapse was higher in rg than in nrg patients ( 57 . 1 vs 23 . 1 % ) .    2.9634954819109303
in all cases ect was well tolerated ; UNK applications of ect did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity .    3.1234893897801785
however , rg patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications , which were noted in three rg patients ( 37 . 5 % ) , but only in one patient ( 6 . 2 % ) in the nrg ( fisher ' s test , p = 0 . 09 ) .    4.243785415056056
taken together , our results demonstrate that ect is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age .    3.2872909066455307
on 21 . 11 . UNK the UNK UNK von kleist and his UNK UNK vogel were found dead in a small UNK by the UNK .    3.845440910912531
the autopsy revealed that kleist was shot in the mouth and vogel died from a close - contact shot to the chest .    2.8264387400093405
the UNK , which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact .    3.2734522207645256
the conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of UNK .    2.8242133216605136
subjective and objective opinions were mixed together .    3.219248923999563
some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted .    3.1756943084852467
there is no doubt that a single emergency phone number is desirable , but in contrast to other countries , in germany different emergency phone numbers and dispatching centers exist for the fire brigade ( fb ) , the emergency medical service system ( ems ) , and the general practitioners ' emergency service ( gps ) .    3.5193979090976932
due to this fact , valuable time is often UNK by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another .    2.693343363054197
further , the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number ( 112 ) was calculated .    2.9026308983642783
a total of 80 UNK calls were received ( city area 84 . 3 % , county area 15 . 7 % ) , most of them directed to the fb of mainz ( 33 UNK ) .    3.366152925617496
the ems dispatching center received 31 UNK calls , the five gps - centers 15 256 calls ; UNK emergency calls that were directed to the police or fb needed transfer to the ems .    2.8903043950026808
during UNK the ems and fb received the most calls , with a reduced frequency on saturdays and sundays ( table 2 ) .    3.0907993907751874
nevertheless , the highest total numbers of calls were received on saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the gps .    2.959361299286222
the fb had the highest specificity of calls ; more than 50 % of the calls to the gps were unspecific ( fig .    3.3924908157417284
of all calls , 4 . 37 % were classified as emergency calls ; two - thirds of these came from the area of mainz during the daytime .    3.47327271237745
during off - duty hours of the gps in the city , 51 % of the emergency calls reached the ems directly ; 49 % had to be connected by the police or fb .    3.4698213397880715
during duty hours of the gps , the fraction of calls directed to the ems decreased significantly to 35 % .    2.874718582293838
during duty hours of the gps centers in the county area , only 14 % of the urgent emergency calls reached the ems UNK directly ( fig .    2.8972252846458786
compared to the multiple - center mode , a hypothetic single dispatching center for all systems would probably be followed by a slight increase in total number of calls due to the fact that the gps numbers would be answered 24 h a day , but there would be only minimal differences in the total number received on most days ; only on sundays would a decrease be expected .    3.316530581440042
the ems area of mainz , with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers , can be regarded as typical of the german situation .    4.09988091930905
the high number of emergency calls to be transferred ( up to 86 % under special circumstances ) demonstrated that this weak point in the german ems system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number .    3.239660854026455
this should occur when a europe - wide three - digit number " 112 " will be instituted , probably in 1995 .    2.77701407515547
additionally , the continued existence of 5 - or 10 - digit telephone numbers for non - urgent calls may be useful for allowing non - verbal differentiation of calls .    3.0775358800781825
the main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time - consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other .    2.9120747954028645
in addition to elevated intraocular pressure , a compromised ocular blood supply has been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open - angle glaucoma ( UNK ) .    2.7356068121823047
the ongoing change of demographic and economic structures does not UNK employment ( as many believe ) , but this change indeed induces problems with the mandatory old - age security system in germany .    3.208130488388138
this paper discusses some popular reform proposals and UNK with another proposal which takes into account economic incentives .    2.8157825404683314
especially the UNK aim of a longer lifetime employment is UNK .    3.0052003840272445
epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to 10 % of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non - polyposis colorectal cancer ( hnpcc ) is the entity most frequently identified .    3.4094384250760377
it was described first by a . warthin in UNK in " family g " and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors .    3.4027662354696813
we report the case of a 61 - year - old woman with five different cancers .    2.60703331697691
although the strict amsterdam criteria were not fulfilled , molecular analysis revealed hnpcc ; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36 - year - old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother .    2.9594446840332385
genetic testing in clinically suspected hnpcc cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the amsterdam criteria .    3.5201288787303313
in patients meeting one of UNK criteria 2 - 7 without meeting the amsterdam criteria , germline mutation analysis is recommended only in UNK - positive tumors .    3.3188811719239895
introduction : the UNK - UNK stent features 2 newly designed " bridging segments " for enhanced longitudinal flexibility , in order to allow easier and safer stent implantation .    3.1400030892586988
the median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla .    2.5015831577495846
in 1984 glassman [ 3 ] presented a conservative - surgical method of division of the UNK suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically .    3.6497393435963534
an orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla .    2.689805613968714
in the period from 1991 to 1997 , 16 patients with a UNK and various UNK findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by glassman [ 3 ] .    3.7892523551231387
after successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase , a mono - or bimaxillary operation was performed .    2.9662727681138263
the use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients .    3.4113239306269527
dilatation of the maxilla was UNK by determining the pre - and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and x - ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla .    3.3953120549353293
in one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years , a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture .    4.288351941000602
the method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of le fort i plane is suitable for patients up to the age of 30 .    3.7695196400860524
in older patients , the median palatine suture should be UNK as well .    4.667229863345264
osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease .    4.646323030864249
in addition to known risk factors e . g .    2.653939579233265
genetics , age and hormonal status it has been suggested that chronic - repetitive micro - and substantial ( macro - ) injury may play an important pathogenetic role .    3.295936893523185
arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication following vascular trauma .    3.9183563125432177
we report a case of an arteriovenous fistula of the neck after a penetrating injury .    2.950013267227676
the only presenting symptoms were a UNK and a UNK murmur .    3.7347727668688986
there were no signs of cardiac insufficiency .    2.9505125875210885
duplex scan and arteriography detected an arteriovenous fistula between the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein .    3.347516454243147
treatment should be carried out as soon as possible , and is then usually simple and successful .    3.5506344074801994
pathogenesis : arteriosclerosis and UNK ' s disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall .    3.637840915171564
while mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients , arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors .    3.69707240592623
UNK ' s mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media , whereas arteriosclerosis - associated calcifications primarily involve the intima .    2.937131472695205
the new technique of non - invasive magnetic resonance ( mr ) sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland .    3.3733538411661477
ten volunteers and 15 patients with various symptomatic diseases of the parotid gland were tested in the present study .    4.0221515865170305
diseases included pleomorphic adenoma , UNK , carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma , ductal carcinoma , adenoid cystic carcinoma , UNK carcinoma , non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma , UNK , UNK , UNK ' s syndrome and congenital duct UNK .    3.529151755371501
in addition to the usually performed t1 and t2 cross - sectional sequences a heavily weighted t2 sequence ( tr 3600 , te 800 ) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid - filled parotid duct .    2.6521765667600343
results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients , except one with sicca syndrome .    3.3335768631980556
pathological conditions such as duct dilatations , duct strictures , obstructing duct UNK and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable .    2.777198170158816
while x - ray sialography obtained a higher resolution , only mr sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction , as well as all ductal cysts .    3.53221443856123
our findings show that mr sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system .    3.175549054637712
there have been no contraindications or complications to date because mr sialography is non - invasive .    2.941343808420632
the technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve .    2.978766066999367
substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields .    3.0581611220686478
such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal UNK or with the recently available dynamic UNK UNK ( UNK ) .    3.2366469722960995
for treatment planning a new kind of planning program is required that can calculate the 2 d - intensity matrices for each photon field .    3.021836798897169
at the german cancer research center ( UNK UNK ) such a program has been developed under the name of " UNK " ( conformal radiotherapy ) .    3.6780089313865827
although it is an independent application , it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present .    3.449966670308791
so - called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 d planning , as the trial - and - error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided .    3.3462435637940504
instead , the radio - oncologist is given the chance directly to UNK medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume , maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors .    3.0155745412069987
in addition , the so - called UNK optimization allows aimed , partial overdosage , especially in UNK structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results .    3.0528732213022014
the problem six - year old boy with unilateral type - ii UNK , UNK and UNK of the 2nd toe .    4.311713846624479
the marked UNK of the forefoot not only causes painful pressure points but also problems with fitting of shoes .    3.6257711652957396
a child with typical signs of the cat eye - syndrom except the characteristic feature of a cat eye is reported .    2.9609415828617847
in a chromosome analysis ( 47 , UNK , + mar de novo ) an extrachromosome was detected .    3.3465771097090493
using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker UNK to chromosome 22 .    2.7259556769663313
in the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome .    3.479588323823506
however , there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations .    3.272635758437143
the great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric UNK on the long arm of chromosome 22 .    3.064003766117852
according to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome .    3.3505802275351266
probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome .    4.377410743706486
introduction : children with all frequently present with skeletal pain at the time of diagnosis .    2.860917401911879
we retrospectively analyzed the incidence and clinical features of skeletal pain and the correlation between pain and radiographic findings .    3.5796334075077403
objective : elevated levels of interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) have been reported after cardiac operation , during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection .    3.697108105709911
although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect , the actual mechanism is not completely understood .    3.3255765390454104
speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus .    2.835777653638171
therefore this study analyzes whether il - 1 and / or il - 6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus .    3.1322141657616265
methods : during aorto - coronary bypass operation , human muscle fibers were excised ( n = 32 ) and skinned using UNK - x - 100 .    3.050939934319503
the experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane - related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself .    3.1484283841720475
different concentrations of il - 1 and il - 6 were applied ( pil - 1 / il - 6 1 - UNK - 5 - 10 - UNK ) .    3.7141608488134286
force generation , calcium sensitivity , and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured .    3.2671928634933334
( experiments were carried out at optimal length , bath temperature 23 °c , and UNK conditions . )    3.885686040759685
results : none of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental UNK a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to il - 1 and il - 6 .    3.01677466875132
despite using UNK concentrations of il - 1 and il - 6 ( pil - 1 / il - 6 10 - UNK ) no significant effect occurred .    3.3170775441009432
furthermore no difference in calcium - sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of il - 1 and il - 6 could be observed .    3.4167117228305126
conclusions : thus , there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by il - 1 or il - 6 .    3.50802118546241
given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic UNK that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism .    3.277918695974334
these data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising .    3.2840093036118168
indications for UNK and radiocarpal UNK and UNK are osteoarthritis , kiehnböck ' s disease , rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint .    3.65826307082544
the resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist .    2.989404950192584
in conclusion we recommend resection - arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb UNK - metacarpal osteoarthritis .    3.297181266628691
implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load .    3.1278327014564704
therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients .    3.0092019199715367
of the limited carpal arthrodeses the UNK - UNK arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure .    4.069014222663809
it can be indicated for UNK - osteoarthritis , kiehnböck ' s disease , UNK - lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint .    3.480015874266408
persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly UNK by simultaneous wrist denervation .    2.943793118707667
in advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient .    3.4764589962843315
increasing numbers of UNK at the anaesthesiologist ' s UNK , providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient ' s condition , have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form .    3.5392948299424227
consequently , this most common method of record - keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate .    2.7866550076823424
in recent years UNK data - acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records .    3.8085426712647554
but after a 7 - year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia , we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record - keeping will achieve wider acceptance .    3.6193476479603612
the first is the handling problem , which was discussed in a previous paper [ 11 ] .    3.196757795592146
the second major problem is the appearance of artifacts , caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation .    3.2919232284180584
in this paper , 300 courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on - line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated .    3.268373697562533
algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process ; the efficiency of that " artifact filter " was validated in 35 of the 300 cases .    3.0789366381836936
based on more than 30 , 000 values for each parameter , the incidence of artifacts was 3 % - 7 % .    3.8187646184668247
however , only 0 . 1 % - 0 . 5 % of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter .    4.201245973543046
the method described here provided acceptable UNK UNK of the most important haemodynamic parameters ( figs .    3.966544827406999
1b and 2b ) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data - examination processes , which are currently being developed in our clinic .    3.498213821479603
extracorporal shock wave application ( eswa ) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys , bile , pancreas and the glandula parotis .    2.218529240160411
the aim of this study was to explore the effect of high energy extracorporal shock waves in patients with painful calcaneus spurs .    3.1001602126046137
83 patients who underwent UNK treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0 , 30 mj / mm2 .    3.9411376058373415
follow - ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain - free and 20 patients improved from the treatment .    3.5411313723168503
the results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar UNK .    3.353521837381291
in developed countries , medical conditions , rather than lack of food , are the main UNK to malnutrition .    3.4320188822921374
undernutrition is especially common in older persons , occuring in 5 - 12 % of community - dwelling older persons , in 30 - 61 % of hospitalized older persons , and in 40 - 85 % of persons in long - term care institutions .    3.8144777732095156
the multi - factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes .    3.3395475281350997
heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the UNK of undernutrition .    4.077465969248779
this structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition .    4.055947786752605
the number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years .    3.2381865471172966
therefore , a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important .    3.038778194381833
the aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low - dose midazolam ( 3 . 75 mg ) , especially during the postoperative period .    3.118215910475381
heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per - UNK frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction .    3.7413420919050138
according to the new york heart association , the severity of heart failure is classified into four grades ( nyha i - iv ) .    3.227237450054662
predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease , hypertension , cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases .    3.1751749857978173
psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical - geriatric department in a general hospital .    3.135217998247831
based on the clinical examination and the values of the mini - mental - state - examination ( 2 ) , 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state .    3.4890660888071676
the other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening - scales ( geriatric depression scale ( 11 ) ; hospital anxiety and depression - scale ( 4 ) .    2.9993070844976986
if these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder , an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in UNK treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff .    3.764923426379104
dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests .    3.007648967855116
psychic disorders were found in 41 patients , mostly adaptation disorders and depressions , the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy .    3.47292708299344
the screening instruments turned out to be reliable , so they can be recommended for further use .    3.534537001131199
difficult to answer remains the question , how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical - geriatric department .    3.4727006714250335
based on the " trauma registry " of the german society of trauma surgery , an UNK quality management ( qm ) system was implemented .    3.3971197753140343
the principles of the qm system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented .    3.714170767835789
the analysis uses the data on 2 , UNK severely injured ( iss = 22 + / - 14 ) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2 / 93 and 12 / 97 .    3.3054661115498236
the z - value of the whole series was - 0 . 24 .    4.079887816931964
clinic a had a good ( - 2 . 49 ) , clinic b an average ( - 0 . 3 ) and clinic c ( 3 . 62 ) an adverse z - value .    3.9184662139495474
the assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases .    3.4308868867727385
clinic c had a prolonged preclinical treatment time ( 90 min vs 62 min in clinic a ) for severely injured ( iss > 15 ) patients .    3.0565448541504567
at the same time , the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma ( ais > 3 ) was lower ( 44 % ) in clinic c than in a ( 62 % ) .    3.178917784786921
with 14 min clinic a had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed ( x - rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound ) in cases of severe blunt trauma ( iss > 15 ) , compared to 54 min in clinic b or 31 min in clinic c . also , cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury ( gcs < 9 ) was applied significantly faster in clinic a ( after 36 min ) than in clinic c ( after 62 min ) .    3.154738005248891
delayed diagnoses were defined as the difference between the iss at discharge and the iss at completion of diagnostics in the emergency department ; this criterion was met best by clinic a with an iss difference of two patients compared to five in clinic b and four in clinic c .    3.349842497395457
for invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media ( cm ) with excellent tolerability are available .    2.8721303230182222
the governing practical factors for cm are x - ray opacity and biocompatibility .    3.3743440902816935
tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity , osmolality , and ionic concentration .    3.1455768960520922
in germany the nonionic cm are currently preferred .    3.0303297286961257
because of its low thrombotic complications , the ionic cm UNK is an important alternative in high risk interventions .    3.5280590992052416
in patients with known cm incompatibility , the prophylactic application of h1 - receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications .    2.8192038107040123
background : in the present study we evaluated the influence of topical UNK on intraocular pressure and the blood - aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and pc - iol implantation .    2.7391426111875172
a judgement on the patient ' s quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease .    3.8199015503219487
very often there is no correlation between these parameters .    3.866267577848734
it is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question - UNK since non - life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much .    3.342894811311547
the most frequently used questionnaires are the sf - 36 and the UNK health profile .    3.393961810600063
however , these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately .    2.6188837424224394
therefore specific tools such as the UNK ( dermatology life quality index ) and UNK have been established for dermatology .    4.671071345612697
we surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by UNK using UNK regional anesthesia .    3.1557007976449674
after a description of the surgical technique results are presented .    3.814834783521642
except for trivial hematomas , no complications were seen .    3.2712371830170035
long - term results remain to be seen .    3.460021160974393
the value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) .    3.6804208236416223
clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38 / 69 cases ( 55 % ) .    3.8007675406265973
the chromosome aberrations , especially complex changes , were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as UNK of the haematopoietic cell lines and UNK .    3.789236629161864
complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the mds patients .    3.0653195992399254
our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in UNK the histopathological diagnoses .    3.3735206436197487
recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non - dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis .    3.1275162766106726
in the course of 1 year , clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea , which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people , was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic .    3.4547175635276144
the disease is associated with antibiotic therapy , due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with clostridium difficile .    3.8574328094762653
symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic UNK or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea , abdominal pain , fever and acute phase response .    3.2377783913045293
diagnosis of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when , in addition to typical clinical symptoms , a toxin - positive stool specimen was found .    3.252596720819236
oral vancomycin was effective in all cases , leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters .    3.3667860572091763
according to recent results , in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin - resistance and in view of higher treatment costs , metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients .    3.4609057183747542
this report analyzes 46 cases of personnel - to - patient transmissions of hepatitis b ( hb ) , hepatitis c ( hc ) and hiv in health care settings .    3.1616597756869216
similar circumstances were found for transmission of hb ( 40 cases , 404 infected patients ) , hc ( 4 cases , 224 infected patients ) and hiv ( 2 cases , 7 infected patients ) .    3.468926874365565
cases with the highest number of transmissions ( one anesthesiologist with 217 hc transmissions , and one eeg UNK with 75 hb transmissions ) were attributed to poor infection control practices .    3.0504609533065663
as long as infected health care workers ( hcw ) adhere to general infection control measures , a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform ' UNK - prone invasive procedures ' .    2.792385494226554
whether changes in UNK of infected hcw are necessary should be decided on an individual basis .    3.3354903116806938
often , the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally .    3.2298774733126248
medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel .    3.746365236782269
the healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible .    3.1488883986450382
the introduction of painless , simple , and yet reliable methods , e . g . , pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening , has considerably improved the situation for obstetricians and midwives .    2.8751135502054788
injuries of the spine in children rarely occur .    3.6001549837890305
they amount to about 0 . 2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1 . 5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine .    5.244775938578328
the younger an injured child is , the more likely it has sustained a lesion of the upper cervical spine .    3.4823364491467292
this spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all c - spine injuries .    3.871739969802655
important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years .    3.807653696927117
later diagnostics , classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults .    3.11196738199004
the knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding UNK of x - ray films .    3.665965293928332
typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of UNK of the atlas and the c2 / c3 segment with " true " instabilities .    3.402872623858963
relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms .    3.110197568620768
specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and " fractures " of the synchondrosis .    3.693311674921329
although a variety of histologic entities were described , primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings .    3.751360649295633
over a period of 20 years , 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery .    2.8325772027660046
among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea .    3.1253186840880467
in these patients a UNK combined with tracheal resection was performed .    3.111293862688758
one re - operation for erosion bleeding of the UNK artery on the 8th postoperative day was successfully performed .    3.824243351662876
all patients showed excellent long - term survival .    3.1354209712988506
principles , methods and results of percutaneous therapy in acute and chronic vascular alterations of the subclavian artery and its branches .    3.633684510348805
UNK concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders ( tmds ) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time .    3.0285991460105106
current understanding of this association is reviewed .    2.9874197504268465
an analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of tmd patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise .    3.2632374692629065
however , a cause - effect relationship has not been established to date .    3.396007178520055
theories that try to explain the UNK of tmd symptoms and ear symptoms ( particularly tinnitus ) by a common underlying cause remain UNK .    3.756183237347988
it has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence , tmds and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone .    3.3910895082159227
a methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered .    4.031353541064663
owing to the lack of prospective , controlled , and randomized studies , statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in tmd patients are not well supported .    3.403811266077091
our report describes a 46 - year - old woman with self - inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm .    3.8808386074009245
she induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and UNK .    2.8158106479783824
a preexisting disorder of the affected leg ( postthrombotic syndrome ) and of the affected arm ( UNK subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis ) delayed the diagnostic proceedings .    3.7574442218540582
our case report shows that : - confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self - inflicted origin .    2.7874714346886558
- oedema resulting from a tourniquet and " hysterical oedema " can be developed by one and the same patient .    3.311197222185502
- effective care of such patients is only possible if dermatologist and psychiatrist work together all the time ( UNK psychiatry ) .    3.1873994886702857
purpose : this study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of tmj symptoms in patients treated by long - term orthodontic therapy for class ii malocclusion .    3.9341966512254696
patients and methods : a total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery , 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment .    3.2633577346809735
UNK , disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the UNK - UNK scheme .    3.868708373003322
results : both groups showed a normal maximal UNK distance .    3.2953856150462446
the deviation during the opening movement was mainly UNK in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group .    3.7190575415208773
muscular pain UNK in the group without orthodontic treatment .    3.981733364000485
clicking sounds of the tmj were registered in 70 % of both groups .    3.653027119141241
occlusal interference and a higher UNK distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment .    3.5228681959992567
preoperatively , clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60 % of both patients groups .    3.1951061259992337
both groups often exhibited tmj clicking and crepitation sounds , whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain .    2.9323261165906733
the synthesis of ps 2 protein is induced through estrogen - dependent transcription of the ps 2 gene .    2.846188887230112
furthermore , ps 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer .    3.3727176886092245
in 162 cases of primary breast cancer , ps 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded tissues .    2.9581812606380224
staining was evaluated semiquantitatively using an immunoreactive score ( irs ) .    3.2687754738614556
the concentrations of ps 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay .    3.187678005356633
positive staining for ps 2 ( irs > = 2 ) was seen in 27 % of the tumors .    3.8890186280449637
comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection ( 26 % of tumors had ps 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut - off value of 26 ng / mg cell protein ) revealed an 81 % concordance rate ( r = 0 . 76 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.7604278104202153
univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical ps 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients , tumor size , tumor grade or nodal status .    3.4579316487686405
however , the immunohistochemical ps 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen ( er ; p < 0 . 001 ) and progesterone receptor status ( pr ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.669586399917749
ps 2 - positive tumors were er - positive in 66 % of cases and pr - positive in 73 % ; 89 % of ps 2 - positive tumors were positive for er and / or pr .    3.349393493812952
the incidence of immunohistochemical ps 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas ( er - and / or pr - positive ) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors ( er - and pr - negative ) .    3.558380772192071
patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery .    3.2547737782606556
it is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels .    3.160807787987847
also , there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive , revascularizing therapeutic approach .    3.458248608557204
therefore , acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients , and to assess results of catheter - based recanalization .    3.9541157656221317
we report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the x - linked UNK known as bruton ' s disease .    3.668421076355967
both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months , a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature b - cells in the peripheral blood .    3.5498103354855526
with respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal - UNK disorder with the same clinical make - up as bruton ' s disease .    3.490957241121976
a deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified .    3.4800023179094577
conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest .    3.1150219947383726
the use of mini - devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however , its clinical relevance and longterm - results are still under debate .    3.2441464836267175
this review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm - follow - up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices .    3.847338765128068
the most frequent side effects are urinary infection , haematuria and / or handling problems with the devices .    3.519921625335004
according to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini - devices .    3.123149958215599
although proper patient selection might give excellent longterm - results in patient continence rates .    3.0202441454226845
background : in contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism .    3.4224401786464496
currently two techniques are available : the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy ( park ) and the combination of arcuate UNK with standard prk ( prk - t ) .    3.290667933490543
although there are randomized data for cabg vs . medical therapy and cabg vs . ptca in primary therapy of cad , there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior cabg .    3.0443734359217394
presenting for recurrent angina after previous cabg who required either re - cabg ( n = 67 ) , ptca ( n = 768 ) or medical therapy alone ( medrx ) ( n = 430 ) at our institution during 1986 through 1996 .    3.6329170002567355
outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45 + / - 34 months .    3.7508142290619877
actuarial survival was significantly higher in the ptca - group at 1 , 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina , despite the freedom from subsequent re - intervention was significantly lower ( 1 - year - survival 95 % [ 37 % ] vs . 95 % [ 3 ] medrx vs . 79 % [ 4 % ] re - cabg , 5 - year - survival 87 % [ 57 % ] vs 78 % [ 17 % ] medrx vs . 50 % [ 4 % ] re - cabg and 10 - year - survival 72 % [ 65 % ] vs . 63 % [ 31 % ] medrx vs . 50 % [ 15 % ] re - cabg resp . , p < 0 . 0001 , [ numbers in UNK represent corresponding values for incidence of re - intervention , p < 0 . 0001 ] ) .    3.124674175798853
these findings were similar after adjustment for different baseline characteristics .    2.7044842064884915
due to advances in surgical methods , such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis , there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures .    3.720384318123434
regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis , there is a trend towards surgical therapy , at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa .    3.9333971864856396
this trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible .    3.037650923989668
along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders , surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized .    3.380159901637986
this consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures .    3.055370050067618
conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling , even more so in children .    3.6985924000477772
a case of a 37 - year - old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine UNK at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented .    3.1676342962646973
the symmetrical , simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions , the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable .    4.046440254123218
the situation of intensive care units ( icu ) in germany was analyzed by a national survey .    3.7998668375563707
questionnaires consisting of multiple - choice and short - answer questions were sent to icus of university UNK , hospitals with > 1000 beds , 500 - 1000 beds , and hospitals with < 500 beds separately with regard to the different disciplines ( anesthesia icus , surgical icus , cardiac surgical icus , neurosurgical icus , neurological icus , mixed - surgical icus , internal icus , UNK icus ) .    2.962728558214926
the personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug - addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases .    3.433866167250445
the antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature .    3.4061079895162862
it is related to specific genetic traumata and the UNK of parts of the superego .    3.8429648006036357
during the therapeutical process , the antisocial tendency UNK the therapeutical relation .    3.116892749004204
if it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point , the patients can now enter into a process , in which new UNK and the integration of parts of the superego are involved .    3.888584992620508
approaching the end of the therapy , patients , again , tend to UNK the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process .    4.2401765397076145
objective : the UNK - definition of leukoplakia has recently UNK oral leukoplakia .    3.334659829506954
based on this definition , the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer .    3.297449208455446
design : a total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) .    3.2254470733174996
results : the prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15 . 8 % .    3.426406458797927
additional UNK without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4 % of the patients .    4.086263092712418
there were no significant differences in age - or sex - distribution , history of tobacco habits or diet between patients with or without leukoplakia .    2.9854740583774735
t1 carcinomas were found in 62 . 5 % of patients with , and 24 . 4 % of patients without associated leukoplakia , whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre - operative staging of the tumor .    4.246139756708463
conclusions : the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with oscc was low , compared to retrospective studies .    3.3033884452380313
the presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor , except of tumor size .    3.159337361047323
the results emphasize that most oscc develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa .    2.7924021825455525
cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients .    3.113179706359148
they present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to UNK and UNK .    3.0121552272145333
angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis .    3.87909997120335
we report on a 48 - year - old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma .    3.0606225792555146
the clinical presentation , the history of contact allergy , the presence of antinuclear antibodies , and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non - neoplastic disease .    3.5485218974246813
however , multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma .    3.8295488923311054
this case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema .    3.065064418822444
the marburg cardiomyopathy study ( UNK ) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non - invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( idc ) over a 5 - year - follow - up period : new york heart association functional class , left ventricular end - diastolic diameter and ejection fraction , left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ecg , qtc and UNK - dispersion on 12 - lead ecg , abnormal time - domain analysis and spectral UNK analysis of the signal - averaged ecg , ventricular arrhythmias and heart - rate variability on 24 - hour holter ecg , baroreflex sensitivity , and UNK t wave UNK during exercise .    3.409455594266548
abstract the observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp .    3.694431881724792
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors UNK different biological aggressiveness .    3.2829880398429814
currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require .    3.362953695970057
the need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the UNK tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ - preserving surgery , for example , as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp .    3.75367852753385
the development of progressive disease .    3.3249789625645727
therefore , the clinically orientated basic scientist and the basic scientifically orientated clinician intensively try to determine prognostically important biological variables which would allow to better predict the biological aggressiveness of a single tumor in addition to " classical " prognostic parameters ( t - stage , histological grading , growth patterns ) .    3.11346227638936
in this context , several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the dna - , rna - and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer .    2.8148509277845113
the present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of rcc which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future .    3.042588844461588
until now reports of factitious disease have not been found in the ent literature .    3.8057092910657824
in contrast , the dermatologic literature estimates an incidence from 0 . 01 to 0 . 26 % .    3.612195168518466
in order to achieve effective treatment for these patients , knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental .    3.76467713991818
the present paper describes the variety of disease possible , using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ent department of cologne .    2.9911489325958827
according to the literature , females are involved in a ratio of 9 : 1 , with the majority working in medically related professions .    3.6943987839574652
when a factitious disease is suspected , psychiatric consultation is essential .    3.170344437672405
confrontation of a suspect patient by the UNK is not often considered because several reports UNK suicidal behavior in up to 25 % of self - manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable .    3.7134426842455537
numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending .    3.0696212211561966
current classifications are based on clinical , histopathological or prognostic parameters , as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a UNK assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown .    3.3097804057069875
UNK of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen UNK or UNK UNK .    3.382434178037305
in order to develop more satisfying classifications , recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered .    2.739909930135289
the most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which UNK in the follicular UNK and the fibroblasts of the dermal UNK including the molecular communication between these two cell populations .    3.5110041134054994
research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents .    3.683336486973028
rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis .    4.324983396386556
clinically firm erythematous 3 - 5 mm papules are found mainly on the arms , the hips and the proximal thighs .    3.4331772991596483
the lesions may be pruritic leading to UNK and crusts .    3.853534914058139
histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes , while UNK may be seen , UNK is not observed .    3.649841743292265
this overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help UNK the UNK to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis - related dermatoses .    3.706022480693152
background : the rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly .    3.8371440117986966
we wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids ( UNK ) in 1 year .    3.613445263667084
it is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively .    2.5432392207137537
this study presents a risk calculation challenging this view .    3.0587128115329016
three strategies are presented : prophylactic indication on principle ( a ) , elective operation in every second case ( b ) , and operation in case of strangulation only ( c ) .    3.523498366892252
on the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that , for the male german population aged 65 years and over 69 UNK ( a ) , 36 292 ( b ) , and UNK ( c ) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually ; UNK ( a ) , 145 ( b ) and 123 ( c ) perioperative deaths would occur , connected with UNK ( a ) , UNK ( b ) and UNK ( c ) years of life lost , respectively .    3.359944987794833
thus , operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a ( small ) reduction of life expectancy .    3.4304161980977783
these data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering .    3.3697766305119377
there is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation .    3.123650933161149
since first described by kibler ( 1955 ) UNK areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment .    3.458937114956741
while seldom utilized by physicians , physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work .    3.323434212119213
a certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine , this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts .    3.334861633178825
the actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions , all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings .    3.6483343363023693
in the following the topographic - anatomic conditions are presented of which exact knowledge is necessary to evaluate the palpation ' s result " kibler ' s plica positive " relative to its diagnostic UNK .    2.9746744069604842
aim of the study and methods : in the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated .    3.39366192612956
in 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study ( eps ) was performed .    3.0504903806097303
before eps ( t1 ) , at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation ( vt / vf ) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction .    3.4118985800628665
furthermore , before investigation , after induction of a vt / vf and after a 10 minute recovery phase an analysis of the signal averaged ecg was performed .    3.1812426429812826
nine patients showed a so - called " lactate reversal " , i . e . , an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development , during inducibility of a vt / vf ( group a ) .    3.2394251009596715
the control group consisted of 7 patients without ischemia related vt / vf ( group b ) .    3.1210114974920926
results : in group a significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 ( qrs : 115 . 61 + / - 13 . 86 vs . 126 . 06 + / - 16 . 74 , p = 0 . 08 ; rms : 25 . 81 + / - 22 . 26 vs . 13 . 11 + / - 10 . 72 , p = 0 . 01 ; las : 37 . 72 + / - 19 . 26 vs . 50 . 06 + / - 10 . 72 , p = 0 . 01 ) .    3.295455125619275
in group b , no significant changes could be measured .    3.524653139536852
furthermore , the prevalence of late potentials increased in group a from 66 % ( t1 ) to 89 % ( t2 ) , whereas in group b no increase was detectable .    3.6505950158677267
conclusions : these data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular UNK due to ischemic circumstances .    3.1153250664364083
therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients .    2.895537445246513
recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple - organ failure .    3.183765562470878
important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ards are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation , such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations ( fio2 ) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease .    3.252465844952666
therefore , pressure - and volume - limited ventilation modes with positive end - expiratory pressure , controlled hypercapnia , differential lung ventilation when appropriate , positioning ( particularly prone ) , and aggressive dehydration are used .    3.097115013524916
should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange , the patients may be additionally treated by UNK - venous extracorporeal gas exchange .    3.3691940866436254
to reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic UNK , systems internally coated with UNK bound heparin , which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation , should be used .    3.3218504231578274
from april 1989 to august 1993 , 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ards ; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange ( survival rate 88 % ) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange ( survival rate 57 % ) .    3.154612912919853
the overall survival rate was 75 % .    2.7995902268130055
on the basis of these experiences , we conclude that this step - by - step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ards .    3.0804225530776193
cutis UNK UNK congenita ( cmtc ) is a rare congenital vascular disorder of the venous system .    3.8548899258749163
in 50 % of cases there are associated anomalies of other organ systems .    3.8281131847633
clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life .    3.8539905446637466
we present a patient with cmtc with a band - like pattern following the l3 UNK .    2.9122219149608273
at the age of 13 years , the skin manifestations worsened , with ulcerations and intermittent claudication .    3.5670007148290064
angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery , and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized .    4.167297569105544
to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of cmtc with anomalies of the large arteries .    2.6575133814669254
introduction : the efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms ( paa ) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study .    4.4186488215342905
materials and methods : from january 1985 to december 1996 , 87 patients were operated on for paa .    3.209320943043342
the clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning paa - related symptoms , vascular run - off , and material used for vascular reconstruction .    3.0124428041124576
patients were examined , and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and doppler sonography .    3.5361308529785136
results : the cumulative survival calculated using the kaplan - meier curve was 70 % after 10 years .    2.5930781356156642
asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia , the worst .    4.892215168100602
the outcome concerning patent vs . occluded run - off and autologous vs . heterologous bypass material was similar .    2.633795506048496
conclusion : asymptomatic and uncomplicated paa should be treated surgically .    2.8526674875818956
only paa with a diameter less than 2 cm , and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively .    3.5046559275133533
collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification .    3.950191594109905
the majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis .    2.9925385289162327
in up to 10 % of cases " self - healing " of the skin occurs .    4.922773080247323
we report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a UNK , collodion - like membrane .    3.030639255439026
there also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips .    3.1878560238734353
after UNK of the membrane almost complete UNK of the skin occurred until the age of three months .    4.501928907111555
in the case reported here skin biopsies taken on the 20th day of life showed discrete and non - specific ultrastructural changes , with no features of lamellar ichthyosis or other cornification disorders .    3.079820661057673
past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome ( fs ) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli ( hyperalgesia ) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations ( hypervigilance ) .    3.167300724537579
in order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in fs , cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in 10 fs patients .    2.9761613821533572
results were compared with those from age - matched painfree controls .    3.4093410694672217
amplitudes of middle - latency ( n1 ) and long - latency ( p2 ) laser evoked potentials ( leps ) were significantly higher in fs than in controls .    3.110845876943139
furthermore , laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in fs than in controls .    2.65950358123537
however , auditory evoked potentials ( UNK ) did not differ between groups .    3.95666966102868
the concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among fs and control patients .    2.8713947414774452
yet , the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation , not applied in this study , to reveal abnormal non - nociceptive perceptual amplification in fs is discussed .    3.351216487768319
in a prospective study , 53 fractures of the distal fifth of the tibia were stabilized by unreamed nailing .    3.105058642271603
additional involvement of the ankle joint occurred in 18 patients .    3.2480595347683443
50 patients returned for follow - up .    3.1558465863392886
in 30 patients tibia and fibula were fractured at the same ( distal ) level ; in 20 patients the fracture of the fibula was located more proximally .    3.4783330980202676
in 12 patients the fractures extended into the tibial pilon .    2.987256315800022
severe soft tissue damage was seen in 24 fractures ( 18 open , 6 closed ) .    3.4816852687050637
ninety percent of all fractures healed uneventfully without further surgical intervention after unreamed nailing .    3.2170899418364463
in two patients the unreamed nail had to be exchanged for a reamed tibial nail .    3.0597161205638814
bone grafting and secondary dynamization of the nail by removal of a proximal interlocking bolt were performed in one case each .    3.5071410333450213
thirty - one fractures healed in anatomical position .    2.837530354994548
valgus or varus angulation of less than 5 ° occurred in 18 patients .    3.3485763836597378
one fracture healed with rotatory angulation of 15 ° .    3.1867350549060784
the highest rate of complications ( 22 % ) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating ( of the fibula ) .    4.212187539221201
there was no deep infection .    3.0078167162147054
tibial fractures close to the ankle joint can be managed by unreamed nailing .    3.6675642939981334
distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating .    3.5411233793179724
because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade ii or iii open fractures .    3.3790549471422504
complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular UNK .    3.068417975356679
normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions .    2.9261351857329414
in contrast , tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed UNK .    2.754663064113603
it has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the UNK chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle .    4.090767172556889
the enzyme telomerase adds UNK repeats onto mammalian telomeres , preventing their shortening .    2.899691798533719
telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells , but detectable in tumor cells .    3.1727482687260364
the activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in UNK in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become UNK .    3.783756052275588
this review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging .    2.8998292868505673
it summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker .    3.56299082132119
pcr - based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology .    3.295137479606314
we summarize our experience in this area based on UNK analyses performed during the past 5 years .    4.201397045707494
the peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of dna fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation .    3.527305093719555
for this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation .    2.856126364269608
the shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk .    3.485351332645678
today , the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients .    3.5737594426976393
innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient ' s categories , also .    4.432339888321954
taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed .    3.294430439291012
new developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure .    3.4393284977355734
UNK indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely : negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures .    3.1290432209867443
contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world , in germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet .    4.004323785964961
economical conditions , an increase in surgical procedures in elderly patients and advances in medical science will continue to change the surgical patient ' s characteristics profoundly .    4.106384576052922
from the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient , by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action .    3.4814190143567365
osteoid osteomas are tumors with intense clinical symptoms and extensive reactive bone changes far exceeding the volume of the lesion itself .    3.54337172259566
because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures .    3.133838229189189
we treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas ( n 6 hip point , n 1 iliac bone , n 1 femoral diaphysis , n2 tibial diaphysis ) by excision of the nidus with a 3 - mm UNK - wood needle using a percutaneous ct - guided approach .    3.0501134234557643
seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either UNK ( n 2 ) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96 % ethanol ( n 5 ) .    3.388436674509827
six patients had UNK and constant relief ( 3 years ' observation ) of their pain .    3.324705188637547
in two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful .    3.2738953904371826
only two patients needed open resection .    3.7921250773668724
compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors , sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk , transcutaneous ct - guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method , especially in the region of the femoral neck .    3.7374416211571155
we live in an UNK that could be designated as the post - UNK - era .    4.360133299597894
writing is no longer the dominant sign system .    3.6468317021855854
it is replaced by electronic signs .    3.002020316859001
we consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning - point between these two UNK , because by then , in the years after the 2nd world war the american UNK were saturated with UNK .    3.6083716461843753
thereby , the new sign system UNK itself .    3.2195930109344078
the topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our UNK of UNK , the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs , and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects , which i prefer to call virtual objects .    3.575159891135443
the manipulation of object - choice and object - relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well .    2.750628598697885
these electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own .    3.388489781516116
a totally new class of objects came into being , the class of virtual objects .    2.9344285190907966
these are electronically transformed , completed or UNK electronically produced objects .    2.7429367920364514
this procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object - choice and object - relationships .    2.4507582403445083
the manipulated object - choice and object - relationship is born and , moreover , a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones .    2.6506859494788277
a change of the socio - cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process .    3.271287284545661
new patterns of socio - cultural understanding develop , that could be described as industrial UNK .    3.0928394402199784
the goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships , and to UNK them according to our present possibilities .    3.07116875779731
in this article 34 randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed .    2.7474844904379663
all studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery , but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid .    3.734183433177961
because of differing study designs a meta - analysis of the data is not possible .    3.0941133485118075
dysplastic epithelia represent potentially UNK conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case .    3.930092072421394
the positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13 % .    2.927077945621713
using dna image cytometry on UNK , conventional UNK - smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells .    3.0004041708190776
the identification of dna aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90 % .    2.969776135709086
dna aneuploidy UNK squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade ( h - sil ) which have to be treated whereas lack of dna aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( l - sil ) which have only to be controlled .    2.9774363955395406
the methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation .    2.8792829616436975
in this brief article i attempt to UNK a few salient insights from my career as a UNK and practitioner of psychotherapy : the key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist ' s empathic UNK , coupled with a series of other positive attributes and UNK UNK interpersonal skills .    3.3372014044306386
on the UNK side , patients ' UNK frequently evokes UNK from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome .    3.8660240768004646
percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision , without extensive dissection of UNK tissue , and without exposure of the trachea .    3.1147222046703025
the early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare .    3.405477180524356
proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications .    4.156700089122939
percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen .    2.9822618273625734
it can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications .    3.225383651665331
a short history , the indications and contraindications , the early and late complications of the technique , and comparisons with other techniques as well as with conventional open tracheotomy are reviewed .    3.583633331457778
in this study , a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate - placed implants was performed .    2.602672479735946
an implantation of 16 self - cutting UNK titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 UNK dogs .    3.1431505977228746
of these implants , 8 were placed immediately after extraction of the second premolar and 8 implants were placed after 6 months of healing after extraction .    3.3398903223308745
for dynamic histomorphometry , UNK bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia .    2.9880872012439523
the specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation .    2.881338317740365
a histologic , dynamic , and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs .    3.5186032210146245
a mean surface of osseointegration of 75 . 7 % and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24 . 2 % was seen in immediate - placed implants .    3.5589571730408673
for delayed implantation , an osseointegrated surface of 80 . 7 % and a soft tissue covering of 19 . 3 % was examined .    3.9605892932566595
the fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements ( UNK ) around delayed implants .    3.620285210697212
the result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups ( p < 0 . 1 ) .    3.58001313722904
in conclusion , it can be stated that a new steady - state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups .    3.1136433590110353
there was a UNK healing in the osseous part .    2.9789076018807994
the lower level of osseointegration in immediate - placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the UNK part .    3.409290467498615
thus , a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted .    3.4550591436562543
UNK may be UNK or tibial ( UNK ) , UNK or ulnar ( side of the little toe ) and central ( middle toes ) .    3.900530992714995
the duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit .    3.294149032747552
the metatarsal bone may be UNK or completely UNK , the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal .    3.617364787074039
surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems , for esthetic reasons or , especially in duplication of the UNK , because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar UNK .    3.7149092249596083
preoperative analysis including x - ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results .    3.351569126796234
across centers , transfusion can vary UNK for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations .    3.457713294698948
excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients .    3.3008286443330164
various strategies have been proposed to decrease bleeding and allogenic transfusion requirements in the perioperative period of heart surgery .    3.305179590025813
blood conservation methods were reviewed critically .    3.4155015958303467
avoidance of preoperative anemia , tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations , the use of autologous blood , and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions .    3.617794113668507
perioperatively , maintenance of UNK contributes to improved hemostasis .    3.386192681493427
injections with botulinum toxin type a ( btx ) are considered the first - line treatment for UNK UNK ( st ) , UNK ( bl ) and UNK UNK ( hfs ) .    4.28273511888504
because btx brings only temporary and partial relief , patients frequently try other additional therapies to minimize their symptoms .    2.851273287737461
the subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with st , bl and hfs was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire .    3.014803328414842
two hundred questionnaires were considered ( 112 ts , 54 bl , 34 hfs ) .    2.8881672631499153
btx was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups ( median : 2 = good effect ) .    3.6557139390896
despite citalopram and physiotherapy ( median : 3 = average effect ) , all other therapies were rated with a median of > = 4 ( = minimal effect ) .    3.5086548629788243
patients with st tried 7 . 7 , patients with bl 2 . 4 and patients with hfs 2 . 6 different types of therapy .    4.356915715314283
in conclusion , btx is the most effective treatment for patients with st , bl and hfs , as rated subjectively .    2.8480029333244015
further evaluation of therapies additional to btx injections is recommended .    2.991787097355139
the perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient ' s preoperative state of health .    3.879636079081009
analgesia , vasodilation in vascular surgery ) or detrimental ( e . g .    2.8694337767009546
hypothermia , ventilatory depression ) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used ( e . g .    3.182420563386891
general anesthesia vs . regional anesthesia ) .    3.1397576188944822
yet , all UNK techniques have in common , that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention , but may expand far into the postoperative period .    4.1488889639714905
therefore , many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques , no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity .    4.1419567863068165
1 ) many side - effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase ( e . g .    3.170670164417147
in the recovery room ) , thereby preventing serious complications .    2.8582532466610635
2 ) postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low , that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques .    3.214773096150333
3 ) besides the factor ' anesthesia ' , may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality ( e . g .    3.1340762587761164
the factor ' UNK ' ) which are hardly quantified .    3.5736502719616237
rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient ( e . g .    3.5497394069578796
lack of a recovery room ) , to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another , in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia .    3.6765259972239366
whether the use of a certain technique - e . g .    3.194064022937965
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications ( e . g .    3.198173002993921
rate of UNK subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery ) is presently under investigation .    3.517077242909045
this paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose .    3.4535098724581217
we then introduce its objectives , the members of the study group , the composition of the collective and selection of cases , and the methods used for UNK and recording of data .    4.130808995796087
results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward .    3.5574336412926884
after some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby ( < = 1500 g ) , a developmental risk model is presented .    3.0480618868920173
this is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention .    3.3412050126941475
in the ulm study the comprehensive parent - centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy , supportive group psychotherapy , a home visit and a video - based sensitivity training .    2.862154660650154
the intervention aims to improve parental coping , the process of attachment and parent - infant interaction .    2.9695650298152105
the theoretical implications , the design and the methods of this prospective randomized longitudinal study will be discussed .    3.6500400340691246
we report the case of a 55 - year - old male patient who underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for recurrent benign rectal adenoma .    2.601596341780446
he developed severe postoperative retroperitoneal phlegmon and sepsis and died 28 days after the operation due to UNK diffuse intraabdominal bleeding caused by persistent thrombocytopenia .    3.3413637447718147
rudolf nissen was born in UNK , UNK , 9 september 1896 .    4.137880523274407
from UNK to 1933 he was the favorite pupil of ferdinand UNK in munich and berlin .    3.1817735658404227
1930 he became professor of surgery at the charité .    3.0566801285865655
the assumption of power by the nazi - regime forced nissen to UNK his position and end his career in germany .    2.7803123545728514
he took over the surgical chair in UNK , UNK .    3.61820328162822
UNK in 1939 to the usa , he held surgical positions in hospitals at new york and accepted in UNK the chair of surgery at the university of basel , switzerland .    3.231622620432347
nissen died in UNK / basel on 22 january 1981 .    3.4795852108201513
nissen was a critical UNK clinician , an efficient and popular physician , a UNK and a UNK .    3.8035694273877554
of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery , the first successful UNK in man , the classical works about the treatment of gastro - oesophageal reflux disease and UNK hernia .    3.737170239550761
the nissen - rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in europe and the usa .    3.288662592130934
this study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely .    3.8391020470315285
the particular procedure is discussed , and the necessity of strict postoperative management is shown .    4.28500709949893
between 1994 and 1997 , the author supervised UNK outpatient operations , of which UNK were arthroscopic .    3.1589990992094266
the observed complications are listed and evaluated .    3.0467286165651752
overall , outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients .    3.287685186127206
the criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out .    2.934526960291854
the schering atlas is a teaching file in ct and mri anatomy designed for physicians and students .    3.176837054122311
it is available on cd - rom , shows good image quality , and is easy to use in medium - price - range personal computer systems .    3.0991002513128936
because of the amount and quality of image material , the schering atlas ' s price is appropriate for institutions , but not for private users .    3.2530361640310397
m . UNK developed " dialectical behavioral therapy " specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients .    2.880278652457509
it rests on a UNK model that UNK a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress .    3.7272145304313495
the numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self - destructive behavior , inability to UNK impulses or severe UNK phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem - solving .    2.651338029227933
this concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them .    2.978862841798317
a comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies .    2.872673593960666
parallel to development of the therapy itself , a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual ' s guidelines , thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation .    3.3943727363152485
an initial controlled , randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels .    3.321938788860181
in the current UNK to develop disorder - specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders , " dialectical behavioral therapy " is a noteworthy model .    3.4865920420986027
complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent ; however , osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication .    3.7910737782601727
we present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin - track infection of the halo device , in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding .    3.2661495853090243
the possible complications associated with the halo device are discussed with emphasis on associated head injuries and preexisting neurological diseases , as well as indications for the halo , clinical symptoms of pin - track infections , necessary diagnostic measurements and the appropriate treatment .    3.6646176355847384
the attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - UNK to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system .    3.310685052765294
thereby dysfunctions can be seen as UNK variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences .    3.314891514461266
this leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul .    3.6865235120503628
especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through UNK , a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function .    3.628184356457371
with this hypothesis all UNK of dysfunctions can be explained .    3.2812922332908188
empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in germany are rare .    3.539245569623311
there is a lack of cross - sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long - term course of mental health care costs .    3.4175907013078457
this study combines data from two cost - studies on patients with schizophrenia , conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years , to draw conclusions about the long - term course of these costs .    3.37423828067445
the direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77 . 0 % during 15 years , while the costs of a UNK stay in a long - term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78 . 5 % in the same period .    4.0696157124633805
this increase was 27 and 28 . 5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in germany during the interval between the two studies .    3.6454768140155798
this higher - than - average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost - effectiveness .    3.214650901988557
background : the usefulness of holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited .    3.20820923088051
in adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating UNK and UNK .    3.2409738898834637
there have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children .    3.080614589697459
the immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity , pharynx and larynx .    3.0996077836293052
an operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes , cd4 + t - lymphocytes and cd8 + t - lymphocytes .    3.121415105250364
the cd4 / cd8 - ratio as a marker for the down - regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range .    3.1839213011326932
cd4 - lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while cd8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after UNK .    3.382685006777203
the in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks .    3.268669922473845
UNK , interferon - gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery .    3.1380820004725507
decreases of lymphocytes , especially cd4 + and cd8 + lymphocytes , were significantly associated with the time of operation and the volume of blood loss .    3.979684915156837
extensive trauma , age , different kinds of anesthesia and intensive care interventions were not associated with specific immunomodulating effects , although these factors might be responsible for suppressing cytokine responses .    3.553358484846159
both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment .    3.1668427819973712
monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the UNK of noradrenaline ( na ) and / or serotonin ( 5 - ht ) ; their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord .    4.084441288884758
antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as UNK .    3.5658198903464293
the present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing UNK with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment .    3.2595876687230376
from a preclinical , experimental point of view , it can be expected , that mixed type uptake blockers should be superior to selective na or 5 - ht uptake inhibitors .    3.3269260206407605
the analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs , given alone or in combination with other analgetics , in chronic pain syndromes .    3.6032532140489866
57 clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality : [ 1 ] placebo - controlled double - blind studies with high power ; [ 2 ] placebo - controlled double - blind studies with low power ; [ 3 - 4 ] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls ; [ 5 ] case reports .    2.9583092624616585
a study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence .    3.1352034442002426
the most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included UNK monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order : UNK > UNK > = UNK > = imipramine > = UNK .    3.250836687643256
a statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment , however , must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations .    3.495236083289291
intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis .    3.725139899833371
in critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine .    3.3645060333966894
therefore , surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine .    3.2951801394100615
surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills , while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine .    3.094085149130126
interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further .    4.203131769027596
the cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step .    3.083993766762801
in this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested .    3.3669065438390953
studies in infants with chronic lung disease ( cld ) showed that ( i ) if sao2 was kept > = 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen , rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed , ( ii ) weight gain was significantly better with o2 therapy than without it , ( iii ) increasing sao2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low - flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure , ( iv ) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance , and ( v ) low - flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in sao2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of > = 90 % at rest .    3.2619291240896033
these data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in cld infants if baseline sao2 is < 93 % .    2.8822891851323544
for older infants , particularly with cf , only few data are available .    3.2236371102944137
in these patients oxygen may only be given if sao2 is < 90 % unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia , e . g . pulmonary hypertension .    3.12192783824088
regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy , provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice .    3.0152348386659096
side effects include the risk of co2 retention , which occurs occasionally in children with cf or sleep - related upper airway obstruction , but has not been reported for infants with cld .    3.6606978608028595
to identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required , performance of a sleep recording of sao2 and co2 with and without oxygen is suggested .    3.3809168967198278
in infants with cld , home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered .    3.240552290627048
fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social - economic relevance .    3.213705675167921
for treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards .    3.1363961447663837
the demand for stable osteosynthesis of a3 - , UNK - b3 and c1 - c2 - fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting , even for the elder patient .    2.9857944466930237
the isolated external fixation with k - wires represent special situation .    2.9453391567805935
supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development .    3.152251883422509
introduction : pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus .    3.2949118733277607
due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia .    3.3753092199546755
case : a 34 - year - old UNK with hypertension up to 240 / 120 mmhg .    3.0822527903680887
after diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed .    3.450268746968534
conclusion : the definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24 - h urine collection .    3.0227732904226112
localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and mri .    3.8937578453782726
the definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers .    3.3386327276507815
if discovered later in pregnancy , delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended .    3.0150828288853573
since about 10 % of pheochromocytomas are malignant , postpartum screening is required to detect and treat UNK or metastatic tumors by UNK scintigraphy , chemotherapy or surgical procedures .    3.4083698294639238
ionizing radiation from natural or man - made sources may affect human health .    2.882720115148559
the main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer .    3.137631106649936
to quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed .    3.134726131739604
the ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation .    3.756874382321735
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated .    3.597728013293318
in an asymptomatic 13 - year - old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the aa .    3.276050755438899
UNK , a combination which so far has not been described , that has not been reported before .    3.376046870006003
the vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic .    3.1132400890654495
angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the aa .    3.0230346691330845
after 13 months of low - density - lipoprotein ( ldl ) - apheresis angiographically there was no UNK , but even slight improvement of vascular the disease .    3.3874523871873334
discussion : since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination , we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia .    3.1390940084083763
ldl - apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients .    3.8603337439268786
the therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated .    2.906815213530467
after a mean of 2 . 16 treatments the colour UNK by between 33 % and 100 % in 70 % of these patients .    3.233646767456261
the best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains .    3.226032933528027
in this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful .    3.1270187009152783
the rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5 % .    2.9749610077746733
the results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions .    3.0968987106085857
the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains .    3.388803425418638
most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures .    3.2720189616383464
depending on the scope of the sutures affected , the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects .    3.690880622857516
the etiopathology is still unclear .    3.1907145988595653
various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years .    3.6786518356428113
however , UNK ' s technique of fronto - orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations .    3.380561041710138
numerous UNK have since UNK this operational technique .    3.2911088588160635
it is now possible to treat practically all skull malformations with the surgical techniques available today .    2.9864665484046804
at the same time , these techniques have also aided the UNK in tumor surgery and traumatology .    3.142181488370417
in most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons .    2.8925041119240498
this is different for injuries of the extensor tendon .    2.9544804054492277
three quarters of injuries of the extensor tendon are closed injuries .    3.2627485343557225
therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon , but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones ( 1 , th i , 3 , th iii ) .    3.35170051038101
the shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias .    3.132843475162344
the operation is an important part of a surgeon ' s repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time , especially when faced with strangulation , when tension - free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail .    3.250497191024494
when properly done , the shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to UNK .    3.1969602844515306
other particular advantages of the technique are : safety , the use of local anaesthesia , benign postoperative complications and the cost , which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques .    4.369530829290205
acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge .    3.3234272805023313
acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical / surgical emergency UNK prompt diagnosis ( clinical awareness , angiography ) and therapy ( UNK laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction ; embolectomy , thrombectomy ; and / or bowel resection ) .    3.058017269058633
the difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins .    4.157111587195692
improved survival from UNK mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high - risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures ( intra - arterial infusion of UNK through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection ) .    3.375369781127343
for assessment of bowel viability , the clinical judgement during first - or second - look exploration is still the most reliable parameter .    3.494594800707144
the surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes UNK grafting and UNK endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom - free patients .    3.643043060118432
prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances .    3.249352947999648
thirty - nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis ( caa ) ; the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon - j - pouch ( cpa ) constructed .    2.684571959961087
after pouch - anal anastomosis , local septic complications occurred in 12 . 5 % of patients compared to 20 . 5 % after coloanal anastomosis .    3.929615620225225
stool frequency after pouch - anal anastomosis was 3 . 3 per 24 h compared to 5 . 2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure ( p = 0 . 053 ) .    3.319321189473185
continence was slightly better in the pouch group ( n . s . ) , and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    3.3225982989274248
this study supports the construction of a colon - j - pouch after deep rectal resection , as the pouch - anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome .    2.799188032098121
the introduction of flow - directed pulmonary artery ( pa ) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology .    3.048928344000959
there have been several developments of this equipment in recent years , including continuous monitoring of mixed - venous o2 saturation ( sv \ = o2 ) and cardiac output ( co ) .    2.931104385776117
the high UNK price , however , is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill .    3.5725919661321095
the aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to UNK used intermittent monitoring of sv \ = o2 and co .    2.740772136522923
purpose : persistent hypotony with UNK - UNK is a severe complication of mitomycin c when used during filtration surgery .    3.5717415371221937
we wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial UNK .    3.29454314144732
the detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial ( i ) or necrotizing ( n ) pancreatitis ( ap ) .    3.1122247461071058
the increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with ap may correlate with the severity of the disease .    4.044887036274604
in a prospective clinical trial from october 1992 to august 1993 , 23 patients with ap were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available elisa kits and c - reactive protein ( crp ) by laser UNK .    2.611619242480647
six of 11 patients with nap died either early ( n = 1 ) or of late septic complications .    3.4433609086412194
the peak of cytokine and crp level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation .    3.5457930772820694
the il - 6 concentration in the blood reached up to UNK pg / ml in the 1st few days , depending on the severity of ap , and dropped to almost zero in the next days , independently of the clinical course .    3.1061917962281154
the differentiation of i - versus nap , using a cutoff line of 600 pg / ml , was correct in 20 patients [ 87 % , sensitivity ( se ) : 82 % , specificity ( sp ) : 91 % , p < 0 . 001 ] .    3.262033691682437
the blood levels of il - 8 reached a maximum of UNK pg / ml in the 1st few days , depending on the severity of ap , and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days .    2.9403737337122577
the crp levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg / l and indicated the course of ap correctly in 18 out of 22 patients ( se and sp 82 % , p < 0 . 01 ) .    3.1113237763012207
in the blood samples of five patients with i - or nap , no tnf - was detectable .    3.3392131382823678
the blood levels of il - 6 , and to a lesser extent of il - 8 and crp , can predict the severity and early systemic complications of ap .    3.350133824524769
the excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells ( macrophages , lymphocytes and endothelial cells ) in the course of ap , inducing early systemic complications .    3.3610488389158104
the surface area and the UNK of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties .    3.7694131365666608
therefore , the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters ( pores < 1 µm ) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study .    2.8950297588474894
the UNK phosphates and the UNK included only synthetic materials .    3.6965259268031043
the gas UNK of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric n2 / UNK system ( UNK UNK , UNK ) .    3.6533070728532815
additionally , for materials with a specific surface area ( > 2 m2 / g ) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the UNK - method .    3.7675763816841026
a medium surface area was found for algipore old ( 4 . 9 m2 / g ) and interpore200 ( 2 . 64 m2 / g ) .    3.5867549028163683
all other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area ( ceros80 1 . 8 m2 / g , ceros82 1 . 31 m2 / g , cerasorb 1 . 2 m2 / g , biobase 0 . 7 m2 / g , endobone 0 . 7 m2 / g , perioglas 0 . 6 m2 / g , UNK 0 . 23 m2 / g , biogran 0 . 2 m2 / g ) .    2.9279186873449627
the materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters : biooss 2 - 50 nm , algipore new 2 - 100 nm , algipore old 5 - 50 nm , interpore200 2 - 100 nm .    2.622561897198926
pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers .    3.7081041420923966
the materials biooss , old and new algipore , and interpore200 contain a large interconnecting UNK system ( diameter < 1 µm ) .    2.8582123485924638
for the materials biobase , endobone , perioglas , UNK 50 , and biogran this cannot be assumed .    2.7544487211256192
the materials ceros80 , ceros82 , and cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores .    2.9778980029770907
an influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested .    3.3962682311558274
the literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts .    1.9143334699969583
in the present part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated : .    2.623122927043741
radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage i and iia / b testicular UNK .    3.604183325962882
using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95 - 98 % in stage i disease and 80 - 95 % in stage iia / b can be achieved .    3.25627550079006
disease specific survival reaches 100 % .    3.140941607816637
likewise , radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia ( tin ) in a solitary testis or in case of a double - sided tin yielding safe eradication of the in - situ carcinoma of the testis .    3.821751746214517
objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates .    3.474460260333328
a forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out - patient department because of a highly UNK rheumatoid factor .    3.5477610138996445
since the person was planning an extended stay in africa , we performed an extensive history , clinical and laboratory examination to rule out UNK inflammatory diseases .    3.307857238734248
we further analyzed if the person presented genetic risk factors to develop rheumatic diseases in the future or if the presence of the rheumatoid factor could be a reaction to multiple UNK .    3.5685992055445017
possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed .    3.119705620287164
a multifactorial etiology UNK the majority of cases of alzheimer ' s disease ( ad ) .    3.074128711376324
both ill - defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease .    3.235419521534409
allele 4 of UNK is a genetic risk factor .    4.734439942884236
its presence increases the risk of developing ad .    3.7283459419314635
however , presence of UNK is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise .    3.8424281112832097
apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease , there are rare variants which are inherited as mendelian traits .    3.3734126914912452
to date three genes are known that can be mutated in these rare forms of ad .    3.3437504294149285
of these , mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent .    2.7810746685616095
in addition , mutations in the gene presenilin 2 on chromosome 1 and in the amyloid precursor protein gene ( app on chromosome 21 ) occur in autosomal dominant ad .    2.875434385850444
this article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of ad and discusses its relevance for patients with ad and their relatives .    3.4349496280281726
in recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother - daughter - relationship with the conceptions of the ' UNK complex ' ( UNK - UNK ) , the ' symbiotic UNK ' ( UNK - freud ) , the ' higher permeability of the ego - boundaries ' ( UNK - UNK ) , and the ' conflict of separation - UNK which has to be resolved again and again throughout life ' ( UNK ) .    3.392270878892041
in the light of these conceptions it is UNK that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender ( female - female UNK ) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre - UNK mother - daughter - relationship are UNK .    2.90603528381472
there has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years .    3.446860581002682
associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis .    4.115025786147187
over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated .    3.561590833990713
out of these 39 ( 30 . 9 % ) sustained additional UNK injuries and represent the study sample .    3.5784662179280216
type b injuries according to the ao classification occurred in 16 ( 41 % ) patients , type c fractures in 23 ( 59 % ) patients .    3.6144692486488923
the spleen , liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs ( 58 . 9 % ) , followed by urogenital lesions ( 46 . 6 % ) , nerve injuries ( 25 . 6 % ) and vascular lesions ( 15 . 3 % ) .    3.997680817845827
the most common UNK lesions were thoracic injuries in 56 . 4 % and severe head injuries ( gcs < 8 ) in 33 . 3 % .    3.289664654133833
the mean hannover UNK was 35 . 6 points , the mean injury severity score 27 . 6 points .    3.5958665378199317
UNK was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures ( 53 % ) , eight procedures ( 50 % ) in type b fractures and 13 ( 56 % ) in type c fractures .    3.877065727392544
in type b injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases , in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case .    3.7470850075690234
in type c injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients .    3.2696048328017557
in four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral UNK .    3.1315954231331133
all surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months ( range 7 - 59 months ) after the trauma .    3.976853828659044
the patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the german society of trauma surgery .    2.905307828624084
53 . 4 % of the type b fractures showed a good clinical outcome , 47 . 6 % a poor outcome .    4.310531232221478
15 . 4 % with type c fractures presented with a good outcome , 84 . 6 % with a poor outcome .    4.631445672009462
80 % of the type b and 23 % of the type c fractures had a good radiological outcome .    4.046430125197781
20 % of type b and 77 % of type c injuries had a poor radiological outcome .    4.0338981155806914
five patients ( 12 . 8 % ) sustained persistent urological symptoms .    3.739454907225155
three of these had urinary dysfunction , two used permanent UNK due to their severe UNK deficit after a head injury .    3.1598151114609534
ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus .    3.3759371083661254
the mortality rate was 28 % .    3.037670052646048
seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding , four in the intensive care unit from multi - organ failure .    2.9516081280638415
the management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury .    3.4130512119967045
lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present .    3.2766799787604475
urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency , urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks . we recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression .    3.6215410079428163
the treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating .    2.7490705132521662
if this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice .    3.4342467213077628
dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - UNK UNK resulting form a lack of stimulation of the " behavior inhibition system " on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other .    3.6249608818882533
the examination of primate behavior provides a model which may UNK these seemingly contradictory hypotheses .    3.006008383761966
according to primate experiments , UNK depletion results in anxious and UNK behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress , which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate .    3.183375703256407
young non - human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and UNK , while as adults they tend to be aggressive , UNK excessive amounts of alcohol and are less UNK by alcohol intake .    3.1172347581122803
these observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies .    3.4945940126466875
persistent breakdown of the blood - aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long - term prognosis .    2.9495722131150948
using laser - UNK , we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long - term postoperative course for both surgical procedures .    4.266119746748597
during the first 3 postoperative days , flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured pcl than in the conventional pcl group .    3.5482843415753087
cell counts after transscleral suture fixation ( 27 . 7 + / - 18 . 3 / 0 . UNK mm3 ) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days .    3.873485737803211
in contrast , the conventional pcl group regained the preoperative level ( 2 . 5 + / - 5 . 1 ) after 3 days .    3.5261781206986527
after 3 months , no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups .    2.963891262962441
after implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses , breakdown of the blood - aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional pcl implantation .    2.781758623111066
however , the barrier function was re - established equally in both groups in the long term .    3.2008873538220866
no signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found .    3.506703902443832
there is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension .    3.2042301189739737
we report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication , which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep - disordered breathing .    3.0195238224841034
the 36 year old male ( body mass index 31 kg / m2 ) was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule .    3.16396912737169
diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work - up in the acute hospital .    4.226181680418072
blood pressure was adjusted with five - fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation , but was still elevated with " non - dipping " as determined by long - term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages .    3.36580205071881
polysomnography confirmed the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea .    3.962578409922824
10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal cpap blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night .    3.2753785251477705
medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge .    3.5344952385708726
moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient .    3.6895140210803143
the case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep - disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke .    3.720254010453666
the possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis .    3.5438626499513903
this is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the dept .    3.973633597218054
of trauma surgery in collaboration with the medical dept .    3.7190177147723857
microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy .    3.328392231966452
in accordance to a literature review , this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation .    3.672161747197086
the purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose - dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to UNK therapeutic possibilities in UNK and pseudarthroses .    3.782849838998155
from january 1994 to january 1996 , 18 patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis .    3.4498122955925843
all patients received intraocular and systemic antibiotics in accordance with the first group of patients in the endophthalmitis vitrectomy study .    3.63621560176399
the aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the visual outcome of surgical treatment .    3.2214934950655456
tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long - term ventilated icu patients .    4.118831818918149
in the last few years , percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( pdt ) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy .    2.7941511420372294
our study seeks to evaluate tlt in terms of complications and practicability .    3.180312460910232
mean operative time was 9 . 8 + / - 10 . 9 ( range 6 - 27 ) minutes .    3.3656144552662477
severe complications , such as bleeding , aspiration or infection of the UNK have never been noted .    4.478265896899543
a slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively , demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily .    3.0863034039569723
however , no patient became hypoxic during the procedure . since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen , tlt should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80 % .    3.1433947564990192
despite the fact that severe complications associated with tlt have recently not yet been reported , physicians who perform tlt should be well - trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy , too .    3.1664476011538496
according to our present data , tlt seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to pdt .    3.0100847309812986
nevertheless , for a UNK evaluation of tlt , further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary .    4.184223940228649
a study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions .    3.360747161345395
in volunteers , in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of gnrh , no alteration in sexual reactions occurred .    3.2909320121684633
it is possible that other testosterone fractions are more UNK than the total testosterone .    2.9859020721166636
however , all the known fractions correlate closely .    3.095154095700436
the significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now .    3.5271964995861125
in an animal experiment , the intracavernous pressure , the density of - receptors , and the UNK activity depended on normal testosterone levels .    3.530092440902494
it is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans .    3.152539886360458
in a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7 . 45 % potassium chloride - solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day .    3.147512586744988
the epidural potassium chloride administration resulted in a paresis and painful paraesthesia of the patient ' s legs and a level of sensory blockade to th 11 .    3.465568703645586
furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed .    3.0135084597103363
for therapy a single bolus of 40 mg dexamethasone was administered intravenously followed by an epidural infusion of UNK 0 , 9 % 99 cc / h for several hours .    3.1263751528499375
about 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared .    2.9832668261661954
it is proposed that the use of colour - coded epidural catheter devices and UNK electrolyte solutions as well as infusion - pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications .    3.6671470842710825
this paper reviews respiratory muscle / circulation interaction in congestive heart failure .    2.4403982574841114
respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - UNK capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients .    3.032694308834164
the mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented .    4.110610570702972
not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients , but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation , such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation .    3.287925190859605
the underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed .    2.7908578137951587
traumatic , perilunate dislocations are rare lesions , and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures .    3.619338988293866
unfortunately , one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized , although conventional x - rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48 % of cases , which can be improved by performing ct or bone scan in addition to 62 % and 95 % , UNK .    3.621636469306177
forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism .    3.9265371914735714
the treatment consists of open reduction , predominantly of the lunate bone , and internal fixation .    3.5242392674215375
huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and UNK are ideally fixed by means of compression screws , while smaller fragments can only be aligned with kirschner wires .    3.9602580627654596
osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems .    3.703214501786942
in cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator .    3.0644144110070983
the best results on the martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of / damage to different tissues .    2.8635616076867345
although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20 % in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all , the martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow - ups .    3.3458638282413076
maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns .    3.0827579724026
the aim of this study was to investigate the mothers ' attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result .    2.8081097274855273
interleukin - 2 ( il - 2 ) and interferon - ( ifn - ) were both administered subcutaneously ( sc ) in combination with intravenously ( iv ) applied 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) for the treatment of patients with UNK renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) .    3.31103566269719
the therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of 8 weeks , which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen .    3.690019207182314
the ifn - was given in each of the 8 weeks ( 6 - 9 mu / m2 once to three times weekly sc ) combined sequentially with il - 2 ( 5 - 20 mu / m2 three times weekly sc for 4 weeks ) and 5 - fu ( 750 mg / m2 iv weekly for 4 weeks ) .    3.573468723886894
among the 30 consecutive patients treated , in 2 cases a complete , and in 9 cases a partial , remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases , with an overall objective response rate of 37 % .    3.8305941988306773
mean response duration was 8 months ( range 3 - 18 months ) .    3.252340241435925
a stable state of the disease lasting 3 - 18 months was observed in 10 cases .    4.699486759293638
the side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade i ( n = 2 ) , grade ii ( n = 22 ) and grade iii ( n = 6 ) , according to the who classification .    3.71881419092258
in conclusion , this triple - drug UNK demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive il - 2 treatment regimen ( applied iv ) , but without its high toxicity .    3.385249165178668
compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage cvi i and cvi ii according to widmer ' s classification .    3.567938223054095
compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks .    3.0956894235035732
the cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy , after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks .    3.179825516428563
marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks , along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume .    3.5412646405152834
video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and UNK halo diameter .    3.7730021353140293
compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation .    3.761191135948264
the efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar .    2.815269143865691
the splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock .    3.6566730744074785
the mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state .    3.313225751314545
the specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia , particularly in low flow states .    3.000622402984953
as a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and UNK to UNK from the gut lumen .    3.5931968337837015
activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome .    3.1818361924001635
so far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction .    3.285377214099664
as pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current , the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current .    3.1276745691073566
whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow - up , was studied in 87 patients who received the vdd - single lead UNK 425 connected to the pacemaker unity ( UNK intermedics ) .    3.0679243432455157
the impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow - up were assessed for each patient .    3.840732808913837
similar impedance values were defined , if the two measurements were within a range < = - 100 to + 100 .    3.3740874646236834
six - months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation , if the difference exceeded > - 100 or > + 100 .    3.2406195582276873
at implantation , impedance was 535 + / - 98 ( range : UNK - UNK ) and significantly increased to 604 + / - 160 ( range : 361 - UNK ) after 6 months .    4.693722420784851
mean difference between the two measurements was 69 + / - 162 ( range : - UNK UNK + UNK ) .    4.372829407118727
similar impedance had 43 ( implantation : UNK + / - 75 , 6 months : 531 + / - 87 ) , lower values 11 ( implantation : 660 + / - 83 , 6 months : UNK + / - 73 ) and higher values 33 patients ( implantation : UNK + / - 99 , 6 months : UNK + / - 168 ) .    3.4297154103898086
compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation .    3.7984223795294954
conclusions : pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation .    3.0004677372692417
pacing impedance changed > 100 in 51 % of the patients .    3.2663704797446034
the long - term follow - up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally , but not for the individual patient .    3.0255760525176645
endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might , therefore , play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis .    2.9672755580558805
the aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin - 1 ( et - 1 ) release following a local endothelial injury during ptca ( group a ) and after sustained myocardial ischemia ( group b ) .    3.161585420540165
additionally , the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed .    2.8664519067001795
since first described in the early 1990s , coronary magnetic resonance angiography ( mra ) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease .    3.1645368250360413
despite technical limitations , coronary mra has established value for imaging of anomalous coronary artery and assessment of bypass graft patency .    3.34019465975036
current research focuses on the development of optimal respiratory compensation strategies , improved spatial and temporal resolution and faster acquisition of image data .    3.3337173801621085
the accurate detection of stenoses and assessment of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is presently being evaluated with large multicenter studies .    3.544673869053876
with further technique UNK and more clinical experience , coronary mra is likely to become the dominant noninvasive modality in clinical cardiology .    3.300361232115259
which steps are to define as a standard of a careful procedure ?    3.8045798296678988
a digitised three - dimensional ( 3 - d ) image of the face has many valuable uses .    3.8656389513969627
these include accurate measurements of facial morphology , clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures .    2.998356007285078
a new system presented here , based on UNK techniques , instantaneously UNK digitised images using high - resolution cameras .    3.3024897880740522
it has an accuracy of more than 0 . 5 mm rms and creates the 3 - d image from approximately 20 , 000 points .    3.4325995901348634
the principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed .    3.0046817648410804
surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated .    4.37677087560861
a potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial .    2.7460986129919576
phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials .    3.5945965117181102
in the present study , a potential drug - drug interaction between phenprocoumon and UNK , causing an alteration in UNK effects , has been investigated .    3.5195746903793514
to analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments , especially the disc , after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with ao internal fixator , we performed magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the UNK region after implant removal .    3.7936559527290985
there were two aspects of disc degeneration ( dd ) : ( 1 ) biochemical changes and ( 2 ) structural damage .    3.3524987857952
mri detects biochemical processes as one aspect of dd that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture .    3.3490723943520284
none of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus , which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability .    4.116482837651912
we observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture - adjacent discs and alterations of UNK shape more often in the upper of the two , whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree .    3.652347102787367
the UNK of upper - disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage , such as alteration of shape and loss of height ( altogether more frequent in the upper disc ) .    3.233699843150651
our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation .    2.863979043882522
with regard to the upper disc , the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised .    3.475007129380631
the question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone .    3.245518005012764
besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by mri , a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions .    3.519267737723124
to study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in central europe , patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984 - 94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible .    3.391967128673066
the incidence of cold urticaria was found to be 0 . 05 % .    3.8642296653321124
the mean age was 41 . 0 + / - 15 . 6 year , the mean duration of disease 7 . 9 + / - 5 . 8 years .    3.807945934742929
atopy was found in 46 . 5 % of patients , and 23 . 2 % of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria ( cholinergic , chronic idiopathic , UNK , UNK and heat - induced ) .    4.421506192879794
laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal .    3.4595641739731535
44 patients were treated with antihistamines , with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement .    3.5734824073607085
treatment with antibiotics ( penicillin , 1 - 2 UNK iu / d over 2 - 4 weeks , n = 18 , or UNK , 2 g / d over 2 weeks , n = 10 ) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8 .    3.692897867920779
during an average of 6 . 5 year - follow - up , 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission .    3.4895144880628743
the good therapeutic response to antibiotics in this study underlines the need for a better elucidation of the cause of cold urticaria , in view of possible infectious causes .    3.947830885420461
background : since its first implantation as an UNK replacement in the united states in 1985 , hydroxyapatite has been rarely used as an orbital implant in germany .    3.1936289378868272
the aim of the study was to collect data on long - term tolerance , postoperative complications and the cosmetic end results .    3.065327692542569
a 37 - year - old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications .    3.284082613985046
she developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders , the right elbow and both hip joints .    2.94547979162137
owing to complete joint stiffness , she was immobilized and unable to UNK or UNK without help .    3.4601129629670626
operative treatment was performed in two procedures .    3.285939941022119
the right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first ; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures .    3.28348228211152
background : atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ( avnrt ) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population .    2.73909700811125
patients and methods : 41 children with a mean age of 9 . 6 ( 3 . 7 - 16 ) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ( avnrt ) refractory to medical treatment ( n = 38 ) and recurrent syncope ( n = 3 ) underwent electrophysiologic ( ep ) study .    3.35930091281691
in all patients dual av - nodal physiology could be demonstrated during ep study and typical form of avnrt ( mean heart rate 220 / min ) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation .    3.233550260140269
a UNK 7 f ablation catheter was placed at the UNK region of the UNK valve annulus close to the UNK of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial UNK during sinus rhythm .    4.316553012395678
starting at this point radiofrequency current ( 500 khz ) with a target temperature of 70 °c was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway .    3.2587818645269504
if a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm ( < 120 / min ) occurred during energy discharge , programmed atrial stimulation was repeated .    3.0506092411742194
otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus .    3.0994209875946543
slow pathway ablation was defined as lack of evidence of dual av nodal pathways during repeated atrial stimulation .    3.136210267246193
slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial UNK after ablation .    3.314021524605996
results : the number of energy applications ranged from 1 - 19 ( median 6 ) .    3.399767041451619
in none of the patients permanent high grade av block was observed .    3.550307432501679
during follow - up ( mean 4 . 1 years ) two patients had a recurrent episode of avnrt after slow pathway modulation .    3.6251310493407845
all other patients are still free of avnrt without medical treatment .    2.9208666394412752
conclusion : selective radiofrequency current ablation / modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of avnrt in young patients .    2.8607684241318854
since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible , we conducted a study to compare 28 cases from each anesthesiology department .    3.580373802271505
all operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique .    3.502297173265243
the two groups did not differ in age , bmi , operative time , weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory .    3.363879124362298
blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient ' s blood volume .    3.4606994405499365
blood pressure , heart rate , medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols .    3.5274991481297944
results ( means and standard deviations ) : group i ( n = 28 ) and [ group ii ( n = 28 ) ] : total resected tissue UNK + / - UNK g [ UNK + / - UNK g ] ; hb - preop .    3.2787827588184384
13 . 6 + / - 0 . 9 g / dl [ 13 . 8 + / - 0 . 8 g / dl ] ; hb - postop .    3.751660552465337
10 . 8 + / - 1 . 3 g / dl [ 9 . 7 + / - 1 . 3 g / dl ] p = 0 . 006 ; blood loss UNK + / - 339 ml [ UNK + / - UNK ml ] p < 0 . 001 .    3.4116545436358376
after exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss .    3.5745410757411844
map was elevated only initially , while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group ii .    3.9854917226204747
during anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane , the dose of enflurane in group i could be limited to 0 . 3 - 0 . 5 % after initial i . v . administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil , while in group ii without opioids doses of 0 . 5 - 2 % were required .    3.9642877551581486
the well - known dose - dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not UNK by UNK at the operative site .    3.707186936951866
conclusions : blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension .    2.893336945942075
sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane .    3.598192757397451
blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties .    3.1662058949848575
continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery .    3.554296050041496
preparation of the required infusion solution in UNK with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in germany .    3.5688388364847228
the effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties .    3.5132739026333155
the preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0 . 06 % and fentanyl 0 . 0002 % in 250 ml infusion UNK at the UNK of the university hospital mainz is described .    2.9405569862373286
to determine the physicochemical stability , the concentration of bupivacaine - hcl and fentanyl was assessed using hplc over a period of 32 days ; in addition the ph values were determined .    3.226061432801398
after 32 days 95 % of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded .    3.5854083800879506
the ph baseline value had decreased from 5 . 48 - 5 . 52 to 0 . 5 - 0 . 7 units .    3.9272445706645116
the measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0 . 06 % and fentanyl 0 . 0002 % over a period of 32 days .    2.3649466378393207
the infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature .    3.2440995456207253
the programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult , especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory UNK ( mal ) needs to be determined .    3.036619664123883
the aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold ( esrt ) and the postoperatively determined mal and hearing threshold for 27 patients , each having one of three implant types .    2.7059319339474226
the question of whether the esrt provides a practical technique to simplify , improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated .    2.4973485372135165
for the monopolar stimulation mode used for the med - el and UNK implant systems , the average mal and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average esrt across all electrodes .    3.1862741509039827
these UNK between mal values calculated from the esrt and the actual mal values , determined UNK , UNK considerably from one another .    3.5936642974301027
therefore , it was not possible to determine the mal from the esrt with certainty .    3.3744784007330693
the esrt does , however , provide a means to estimate an approximate upper UNK for the mal , apart from its use to control implant function .    3.727133274722813
the determination of the exact mal will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques .    3.4248404942743185
movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems .    3.3184465819142503
we experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and UNK : yag laser vitrectomy .    3.0482821394955355
we report on a 53 - year - old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by UNK aortic end - to - end anastomosis .    2.7644120975533752
after 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft , transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch .    3.04102967807553
the iliac reconstruction was performed by ptfe interposition .    3.894765392744955
there was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis .    2.9850387521338178
at 1 year follow - up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms .    4.412848181109613
in this biomechanical study the implanted unreamed humeral nail ( uhn ) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses .    3.0397713932358577
in literature other intramedullary implants have been UNK for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft .    3.2329514496323903
this study examined , whether the implanted uhn , as well as the uhn implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device , is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly .    3.3226539250493112
to evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses , the uhn has been compared biomechanically to the UNK - UNK humeral nail ( rt ) in paired mid - shaft UNK cadaveric UNK .    3.034052292466091
UNK paired comparison has been performed with the uhn without and uhn with interfragmentary compression .    3.097938381555898
in anterior - posterior , as well as medio - lateral direction stiffness under four - point - bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the rt .    2.7562765809964356
under torsional loading with moments of 4 nm , 6 nm and 8 nm the uhn reached more than the double torsional stiffness .    2.4830043991992023
the rt , which is only dynamically interlocked , UNK a high initial " play " between bolts and nail itself .    3.2781430937423357
through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the uhn under four - point - bending in anterior - posterior , as well as medio - lateral direction UNK significantly .    2.5223131423628473
also under torsional loading with moments of 4 nm , 6 nm und 8 nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly .    2.3510604166330644
in comparison to other biomechanical studies of different UNK it is clear , that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non - statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types , which are critically under rotation , as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures .    3.140986460932036
while the different national health systems UNK structurally , cost expansion in health care is a global challenge .    3.020229226600948
structural UNK have been developed during recent years in the usa which can be summarized as " managed care " .    3.851539391241805
they are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system , in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical UNK .    3.4396374733369446
in managed - care models , patients are deliberately directed to the most economic forms of therapy .    3.569906081848183
the spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines , which lead to a standardization of processes .    3.417376000933492
financing and medical executive responsibilities fuse .    3.4858646566557985
the autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to UNK an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system .    3.2540038300393483
it is progressively shifting to financing institutions , managing UNK or insurance companies .    2.7228116323648037
structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the u . s . and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs .    2.7252420667905115
nevertheless , the us model is still far more expensive compared to the german system .    3.5075611825468567
historical development , current concepts of us - managed care , its potential influence and general applicability to the german situation are discussed in an overview .    3.6798031531572057
on the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy , and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis .    3.3135764585550644
in the early 1980s , a peptide that caused diuresis , natriuresis , and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups .    2.8266645088619082
this was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides , followed by the characterisation of the amino - acid sequences of several species .    3.0586780109546132
research on the immunohistochemistry of UNK / atrial natriuretic peptide ( cdd / anp ) and the regulation of cdd / anp gene expression led to detection of the peptide in extra - atrial tissues .    3.402437162068169
later on , two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide ( UNK ) and c - type natriuretic peptide ( UNK ) .    3.0735315051160623
these peptides share structural features with cdd / anp with regard to their 17 - amino - acid - exhibiting loop UNK by a disulfide UNK .    3.105455551839018
another recently discovered peptide is UNK ( uro ) , a renal - borne new member of a - type natriuretic peptide .    3.4446862080991467
uro was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as cdd / anp , containing the 17 - amino - acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the UNK - UNK of the peptide .    3.5246501575768563
regarding physiological actions , data strongly support a close association between uro and urinary sodium excretion .    2.9670246085661502
the application of uro in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to cdd / anp - 99 - 126 .    2.95083256334554
these results were encouraging for the use of uro in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure ( arf ) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of UNK arf in patients following liver transplantation .    3.831762523704465
UNK the results of these two studies , uro represents a new approach for not only prevention , but also for treatment of arf following organ transplantation .    3.5122898894564436
this opens up new possibilities for the treatment of arf of other origins in intensive care medicine .    2.976660451976403
dermatomyositis in a 7 year old girl was diagnosed two months prior to admission to our pediatric rheumatology program .    3.658618139772407
serological and molecular biology methods were used to investigate the evidence for a recent UNK - b - UNK .    4.309265608641315
objectives wide approach to the posterior aspect of the scapula for internal fixation of unstable fractures of neck of scapula and glenoid .    3.6252012085524288
the guideline " joint swelling " is addressed to primary care physicians - general practitioners , internists or orthopedists without special experience in rheumatology .    2.8195313705858065
it provides a framework for UNK patients , as well as for physical , laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care .    3.6904585915228765
situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described .    3.1639652171846637
the appendix contains comments on signs and symptoms to differentiate arthralgia from joint swelling and on the diagnostic value of a history of joint swelling without confirmation by the physician .    3.609983629642731
further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a UNK form .    4.2542881791705165
the significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed .    3.1840255163324636
introduction : bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure .    2.8502815862417172
four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the UNK classification : postoperative bile fistulas ( type i ) , late strictures ( type ii ) , tangential injuries of the bile duct ( type iii ) and defect lesions ( type iv ) .    3.5020024518593345
the diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature .    3.9991729424080544
methods : eleven patients ( median age 43 . 8 + / - 17 . 2 ) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between november 1993 and december 1998 .    3.045068978403994
nine patients ( four type - ii lesions , five type - iv lesions ) were referred from another hospital ; 2 defect lesions out of UNK laparoscopic cholecystectomies ( 0 . 5 % ) were documented in our own patient group .    3.4266142089073663
in both cases with type - iv lesion and a short defect , an end - to - end anastomosis was successful ( hospital stay 11 . 6 + / - 1 . 0 days ) .    3.0133895158458195
however , a UNK roux - y end - to - side hepaticojejunostomy was UNK in all cases with a larger defect ( n = 5 ; hospital stay 14 . 8 + / - 2 . 0 days ) .    3.74799398507512
the two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with UNK - UNK or hepaticojejunostomy ( hospital stay 11 . 2 + / - 0 . 6 days ) .    3.4930050289230423
conclusions : the incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation , selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure .    2.8372954027151245
the clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center .    3.117388045498554
in the last years the incidence of renal cell carcinoma diagnosis increased about 15 - 20 % .    3.1974965477390387
the main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence .    3.2683708937360767
in the present autopsy series comprising 23 . UNK autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1 , 77 % in jena and 1 , 55 % in UNK ( 200 . 000 inhabitants each ) .    3.324752339457991
over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased .    3.547909441257544
with the advent of atypical antipsychotics , quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly .    3.5156814207849987
the positive effects are based not only on the compliance - enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration , shorter duration , and overall reduction of hospital treatment .    3.0121835705503153
the mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42 % .    2.8122993328915764
in the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non - perioperative myocardial infarction .    3.5693369173048715
however , in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications .    3.2870860670694215
in the last 4 - 6 years acute - ptca has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction .    3.300950598461179
up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute - ptca on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction .    3.291538305505179
nevertheless it can be assumed , that acute - ptca will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction .    3.355733212204429
therefore , in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and , if indicated , acute - ptca should be performed .    3.8589305204831987
in principle , thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra - or postoperative situation .    3.4474161636884983
however , if coronary angiography and ptca are not possible , thrombolysis might be taken into consideration , in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis .    3.5787161992003655
since acute - ptca has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction , this group of patients should be especially considered .    3.995731879133684
medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical UNK , middle ages , and modern times .    3.211889874749317
from the present state of research it is distinguished between " primary illnesses in old age " and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age .    2.93548794422738
even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing , negative UNK of the aging process have to be UNK .    4.330377948037664
advances in medical sciences are a good pre - condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age .    2.8112657176179847
the analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia .    3.278724808012368
with ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography , the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible .    3.419568081482091
transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy .    3.208171824406477
furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy .    3.00145964360614
a prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding , the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma , advanced maternal age , early growth delay or fetal bradycardia .    3.2780587778372587
because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction , surgical therapy of the small - bowel ileus is difficult to standardize .    3.5537056250208714
a homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the UNK bowel ( decompression , endoluminal splinting ) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable .    3.7665992457610584
UNK remains the most common procedure .    4.561533003320213
small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the UNK ' s technique replaced by the child - phillips ' technique and its modifications .    3.664213702606156
however , as a result of the lack of controlled studies , there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication , long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention .    3.696985869862014
this is an important task for the future , especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel - ileus .    3.9622138948821086
purpose : the purpose of our study was to determine the value of mri in monitoring laser - induced interstitial thermotherapy ( litt ) of cerebral neoplasms .    2.554745582964183
a 70 - year - old woman with severely symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was unresponsive to drug treatment .    2.675166564777606
she had recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and syncope and was at high risk for sudden death ; a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator ( ddd - ics ) was implanted .    2.7903541664629765
her initial left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 80 mmhg and UNK to 40 mmhg during dual - chamber pacing at an atrial ventricular delay of 140 ms .    3.178883896828936
in the follow - up over six months she was asymptomatic with respect to angina pectoris ; ventricular tachycardias could be successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or by shocks .    3.163068602379006
a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator is an important therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias .    3.4060926293631275
morbihan ' s disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by UNK , describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face .    3.7679142447189755
such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea .    3.2862925031939403
the characteristic features are a chronic course , a typical clinical picture , lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures .    3.620066515803365
paediatric cardiac transplantation ( UNK ) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end - stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease , particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( hlhs ) .    3.367659513165495
the major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with hlhs and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post - bypass period .    3.933575731732162
objective : thirty years ago , cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) was primarily developed for otherwise healthy individuals who experienced sudden cardiac arrest .    2.79161382599302
today , cpr is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function .    3.0787483971336473
therefore , the appropriateness of cpr has been questioned as a matter of the outcome , the patient ' s preferences , and the cost .    3.992802261223018
the objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation .    2.7074905912516494
arguments : cpr is bound by moral considerations that UNK the use of any medical treatment .    3.4959172870671567
according to UNK and UNK , the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories , principles , rules , and particular judgements and actions .    3.010617128641002
the decision to start cpr is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest .    3.0961186721109692
the decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive cpr .    2.9926003637002405
moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles .    3.8237618074502535
the principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare .    2.689182533166264
talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success , as many victims of pre - and in - hospital sudden death have been saved in the past .    3.2841680742839796
nevertheless , resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases , involving the principle of nonmaleficence .    3.445675868910087
there is potential harm in cpr .    3.024862962246708
survivors may recover cardiac function , but UNK severe hypoxic brain damage , at worst surviving without awakening for months or years .    2.94923526665093
in particular , post - traumatic cpr is associated with an extremely poor outcome , leading to the issue of futility .    3.6437148581322334
however , futility should be defined in a strict fashion , as there might be an individual chance of survival .    2.9643487469531475
the principle of respect for autonomy means the right of a patient to accept or reject medical treatment , which continues in emergency conditions and after the patient has lost consciousness .    3.579524621990702
the time frame in cpr requires medical decision - making within seconds , and cpr is usually initiated without the patient ' s involvement .    3.1738896964474312
if the patient ' s wish ' s can be ascertained later on , life - sustaining therapies might be withdrawn at that time .    3.016958639300586
UNK ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no - cpr document , which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms , but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene .    3.0061504891050403
the principle of justice affects priorities in the allocation of health care resources .    2.7423482269752153
the decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit .    3.1587552366528415
conclusions : the standard of care remains the prompt initiation of cpr .    2.9140341295550445
however , ethical principles such as UNK , nonmaleficence , autonomy , and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine .    3.533714802901434
physicians have to consider the therapeutic efficacy of cpr , the potential risks , and the patient ' s preferences .    4.2350980694657405
acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting - out .    3.2244967089713676
UNK behaviour , too , as a part of the " complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals " ( UNK ) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting - out or UNK - out ( UNK ) .    3.860299048564182
however , this delicate acting has no meaning , it is not symbolic or communicative action .    3.1313537936079823
it is aimed at inducing effects and interactions .    3.0956569857692875
it appears both on the side of the analyst and of the patient and is part of the unconscious communication in the therapeutic process .    4.287928308306733
diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated , how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way .    3.209087370446838
the acting - reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations , by which he unintentionally demonstrates , in what a way he UNK the patient .    3.2149823057222764
background : the therapy of phimosis is circumcision .    3.189893605810277
since many years it has been discussed , whether phimosis is treatable with local estrogen application analogous to the treatment of UNK UNK in girls .    3.782988436311107
this conservative treatment depends on the presence of estrogen receptors ( er - alpha ) in male prepuce - cells .    3.500336032397384
findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast - enhanced colour doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies .    3.4173625730909913
however , the quantification of the increase in colour doppler signals after levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator , resulting in a subjective scoring system .    2.9466408422590034
a computer - assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour doppler signal after contrast media administration .    3.1357293305420035
after UNK contrast medium injection in 47 patients , carcinomas and benign lesions UNK differently regarding degree , onset and duration of doppler enhancement .    3.123434718594658
however , the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis .    3.3520770028595863
rapid image - acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes .    3.5569206605759818
recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure .    2.727314806128466
dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx , often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery .    3.324902710791654
videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition , demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects .    3.5921014241875175
therefore , videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management .    3.394342092009117
we discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the UNK - and hypopharynx .    3.919010466920761
in most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition .    3.173675919464055
our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases .    3.8127513894156997
the patient ' s ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential .    3.1336378672043104
this necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process , which UNK in the same way as other experiences of vital threat , e . g .    3.492171960419942
confrontation with one ' s own dying .    3.594787051961817
different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are UNK of the facts , UNK emotions , UNK with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one ' s future .    4.499622965129404
whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages , but essentially on their persistence .    3.121219810185346
it is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior , stage - consistent interventions and a positive feedback .    3.0314912903787294
a failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having UNK a stroke .    3.7065462317658477
a 63 - year - old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden UNK in UNK , southern bavaria .    3.142383757825635
as the appropriate UNK ( UNK and UNK ) were present , we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis ( UNK ' s UNK ) .    4.335059143561975
by different serological methods ( cercarial fluorescent antibody test , cercarial UNK reaction , UNK UNK test ) antibodies against UNK could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later .    3.980177510417258
cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide , but in central europe the disease is often not recognized .    4.320926302300661
the current adjustment of cochlear implant ( ci ) speech UNK is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits ( t - and c - levels ) for electrical stimulus currents .    3.7106599288256863
these data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients .    2.7487589882019785
in cases with non - reliable patient responses , objective methods are necessary .    3.052598733145457
by determining the aep of different latencies , late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination .    2.8457379284653745
these patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22 - or 8 - channel ci - systems ( nucleus or med - el implants ) .    3.2574156855412326
in all cases , clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected .    2.7443413840045
by making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field , subjective hearing threshold and the t - levels of electrical stimulation could be verified .    3.085734329360598
since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex , their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system .    3.2286974133263078
to date , no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients .    2.6956357064859544
the applicability in very young children remains to be explored .    3.157968780461151
laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery .    3.404777227108645
early as well as late complications are , in comparison to conventional techniques , rare .    4.685631239818359
complications arising from the operative technique are : perforation , early pouch dilatation , gastric slippage , infections of the port and the band , erosion and defects of the band tube .    3.334669675839208
insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient .    3.2641679157868726
in 7 . 5 % of 146 cases , reoperations were necessary .    3.367941175960046
obstruction of the pouch UNK and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance .    4.132326637056342
after radiologic diagnosis the band system should be UNK first and a UNK - gastric tube applied .    3.8478141734930515
if this does not result in the pouch UNK , a revision operation is needed .    3.946168482107333
the significant legal and UNK UNK of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection .    3.5960168533751395
therefore , being the UNK body fluid to handle for drug screening urine is very often manipulated to test clean .    3.088863657441132
methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine , UNK of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in - vivo manipulations .    3.7364433223958526
among these , the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to UNK the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection .    3.465412065673318
to determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined .    3.3554879040260595
based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion , the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed .    2.9167206321712777
a low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample , the application of gc / ms analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a " suspect " urinary creatinine concentration .    3.1396401230443796
one of the important factors in icp monitoring is measurement accuracy .    3.4457226433012917
for a better understanding of icp probes and their differences , the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view .    3.2375813301987892
the therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter .    3.2761808655489943
the following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease .    3.288859146797726
a 68 - year - old male patient underwent a c4 / c5 and c5 / UNK discectomy with interbody fusion of c7 - t1 vertebral body , according to smith - robinson .    2.795522553176383
during this operation , a 3 - cm - long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus , which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture .    3.83010871130229
after recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia , which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw .    3.6399024737825036
after removal of the screw , the lesion was covered by means of UNK UNK .    4.017693341778364
moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by UNK .    3.7018389354711103
introduction : the loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated : a certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity .    3.705363814061064
in contrast , the effect of accompanying pain to every - day life and working ability is not known exactly .    3.1482738015658165
in this study , we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes .    3.022163932039331
beside tnm - staging , histological grading is performed .    3.1910005775898767
this system has been extended by a selection of histological parameters which were studied with respect to prognosis , based on a review of 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma .    3.897428819137737
an increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features : clinical diameter greater than 2 cm , low degree of keratinization , high degree of cellular polymorphism , high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index ( metastases only from tumor thickness 2 , 4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration ) , desmoplasia and ulceration .    3.0400373719831304
consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment .    3.213100266167173
multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors .    3.2702690651030286
therefore , the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise UNK of high - and low - risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow - up procedures .    3.5875931978075433
surgical closure of atrial septal defects can nowadays be performed without preoperative cardiac catheterization .    3.0394739878443
for a transcatheter closure , however , x - ray exposure has been indispensable .    3.7388558522641593
we report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy .    2.5865180448762617
in field research , training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates .    2.9621269624899593
the subjects ( twelve women from 59 to 77 years old ) were tested once a week three times , over three minutes with a break of three minutes , three weeks in all .    3.0735734010453766
the sequence of the dances changed every week .    3.157402786561846
measurement of baroreflex sensitivity is a new method to identify patients after myocardial infarction with a high risk for sudden cardiac death , ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation .    3.4633049330994683
in this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a UNK - device and correlating this with the r - r intervals of the ecg after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of UNK ( UNK ) .    3.313120931529087
according to other investigators a correlation of > 0 . 7 with a significance of p < 0 . 05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity < 3 ms / mm hg being judged as decreased .    3.0615230572173653
we investigated 302 patients ( mean age 59 + / - 17 years , 224 males , 78 females ) .    3.1803365288835215
75 % of the investigations showed acceptable results .    3.7046322065874606
in 77 cases ( 25 % ) reasonable results could not be achieved .    3.483147990677159
we found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations ( 6 % of all investigations ) .    3.8393665003283566
41 ( 13 . 1 % ) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason .    3.8375162492647976
when we looked closely at these UNK results , we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction ( < 40 % ) , diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group .    3.8317775817598894
embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina .    2.9252032961660897
only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix , where they are most commonly seen in adolescence .    3.6134355089664845
their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy .    4.329437502687141
we report a case of cervical embryonal UNK in irs stage ia in a 32 - year - old female .    2.6810793608575327
after surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months .    3.4158724183714297
the case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features , and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed .    3.5522492432620054
the method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon .    3.730305486315768
three below the knee amputations were performed , three patients died , and three were lost to follow - up .    3.439843677417452
in all , 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year .    3.262181030566819
there were no significant statistical differences between the two groups ( p < 0 . 2 , chi - squared , t - test ) with respect to fracture type , fracture location , age , gender or accompanying injuries .    3.348134272947126
the urtn group showed significantly better results regarding time to full weight - bearing ( urtn 11 + / - 4 weeks ; fix 20 + / - 11 weeks , p < 0 . 01 m - w ) mann - whitney test , number of reoperations ( urtn 1 . 04 ; fix 2 . 89 ; p < 0 . 01 m - w ) , isolated bone grafting ( urtn 3 / 22 ; fix 8 / 19 ; p < 0 . 05 chi - squared ) , and average UNK and olerud score ( urtn 30 + / - 4 ; fix 26 + / - 5 ; p < 0 . 05 m - w ) .    3.109166358052027
in all , 15 / 17 urtn patients and only 6 / 15 fix patients achieved unlimited walking distance ( p < 0 . 01 m - w ) .    2.505713294900544
time to bony union , infection , and nonunion were not significantly different between groups .    3.1026414236753315
by varying the light spectrum , impulse length , impulse sequences and UNK , the UNK allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters .    3.7144008875514993
superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations ( essential UNK , port - wine stains , UNK of UNK , UNK malformations ) and cosmetically UNK hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity UNK pulsed light source .    3.707335303421793
catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias .    3.2049898232169576
however , the risks of catheter ablation have to UNK weight against antiarrhythmic therapy .    3.3037891282885523
with catheter ablation av - block iii ° , pulmonary embolism , pericardial tamponade ( in some cases followed by death ) , arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described .    3.521506192238916
especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients .    3.3468356543553663
on the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown .    3.6096309099918575
the risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after UNK infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease .    3.6726676554225084
it is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia .    3.567011753267332
background : chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea .    3.2252633096014804
the appearance of corneal changes does not seem to be related to dose and duration of treatment .    3.5775255570816533
the purpose of this study was to investigate microscopic changes of corneal morphology in patients treated with chloroquine in vivo .    2.7018134860919343
dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms : UNK - therapy , baths , phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments .    3.2452033975876104
which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness .    3.2417003887265086
accordingly , a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease UNK .    2.7943722852155326
in UNK , dermatoses with psychological triggers or UNK , and also depression , pre - existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment .    3.816027696974137
finally , patients who are having UNK accepting or UNK malignant skin tumours may also benefit .    3.2247779049200913
we report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease .    3.7364917713238595
by right bundle - bloc - like qrs - complexes in the surface - ecg , the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal - ecg .    3.6283456247501533
this was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased UNK vulnerability .    3.4125516201086366
during this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated UNK premature beats .    2.7833624488846507
an oral medical therapy with sotalol was started .    3.1344110661411175
after the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done , that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against vt .    3.0610294919917114
so the decision was made for ventricular ablation .    3.467944580994747
after 5 high frequency - applications no UNK ventricular tachycardia could be induced .    3.183470370350697
since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms .    3.070201730147239
the vertebral bodies and vertebral UNK show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone .    3.1425828486490994
the UNK are loaded by uniplanar bending that is reflected by the arrangement of the UNK .    3.139265582725055
the ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and ( with exception of the UNK .    3.7304530752884855
longitudinale UNK ) horizontal / oblique segmental ligament bundles .    3.1741233824852073
in combination with the anulus fibrosus , the ligaments work as a kind of UNK system .    3.093618231783696
they regulate the process of movements of UNK vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion .    3.4916704410042603
besides maintaining the necessary amount of UNK the intervertebral disc UNK the UNK uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies .    3.4932450886214172
the intervertebral joints are important for guided motion , by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions .    3.14835142507467
because of their position , they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes .    3.2134124852670256
the integrity of the fascia UNK warrants the protective function of the UNK muscles .    3.828577592788822
prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced UNK activity and diminished bone formation .    3.04367300315421
these skeletal changes are a typical complication in UNK patients , who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia .    3.9698320524949184
risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade , with some variation in results , partly with geographical region .    3.3091763947433703
four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the central malignant melanoma registry of the german dermatological society ; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development .    3.442067480104488
additional factors were hair colour , skin type and a history of naevus growth .    3.4161229149277363
a classification of relative risks was established by considering the first three risk factors mentioned , without any clear improvement of classification when further additional significant factors were taken into UNK .    3.094481513210046
for example , in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi , 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100 - fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines .    3.170073096414218
early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered .    3.3636162807251955
furthermore , intermittent intensive sun exposure ( UNK as indicator ) before the age of 20 induces the development of melanocytic naevi , and after the age of 20 it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines ; both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development .    3.718259582782013
problem : clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not .    3.0456569801346647
method : children born between 1 .    3.562509969082006
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound .    3.704457560025955
the data were analysed by spss / pc .    2.716265770478239
results : UNK children with 10 138 hips were examined .    2.908411415513224
85 % were mature ( type i ) , 14 % were physiologically immature ( type iia ) and 1 . 2 % were pathological ( UNK , d , iiia ) .    3.7503667836992736
the comparison shows , that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 ( 37 % ) had positive clinical findings .    2.9066179223929764
a screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors ( positive family history or breech position ) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time .    3.2356450820061005
the interpretation of three - dimensional ( 3d ) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two - dimensional ( 2d ) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy .    3.2243953310478877
although in the conventional analysis of 2d display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are UNK assigned to three major coronary artery systems , the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic - anatomic coronary tree in only 50 - 60 % of the patients .    2.8699511567732117
hence , the mental integration UNK both 2d images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels .    2.8713296420192296
for an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions , we have developed a 3d " fusion image " technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease .    3.3040300320606217
cause - and - effect relationships may be more obvious with 3d data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology .    3.3128821201201237
the physician ' s duty of professional discretion is one of the basic UNK at the heart of the doctor ' s profession .    3.266381661748217
it is laid down in the physicians ' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient ' s right to self - determination , which is regulated in §203 of the german criminal code .    3.031417221738682
it is established in the UNK governing physicians ' work and has its origin in the patient ' s right of self - determination .    4.044332235553613
it is also regulated in §203 of the german criminal code .    2.486750883968293
an exception can be made to the duty of professional UNK if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law .    3.1247449318035154
some such exceptions are also specified in the german social code , although the physician ' s duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated , particularly when medical data in the UNK sense of the UNK are concerned .    3.826242130254766
we report on a 56 - year - old renal allograft recipient receiving cyclosporin a immunosuppression .    2.3539665495644084
during this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms : squamous cell carcinomas , basal cell carcinomas , UNK ' s disease , actinic keratosis , sebaceous hyperplasia , a dysplastic naevus and , finally a nodular malignant melanoma .    2.9781005865390466
adverse effects of the cyclosporin a therapy are discussed , with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor .    3.679678535952856
with multislice spiral computed tomography ( msct ) , existing indications for performing ct of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging .    3.192450181112598
the high speed of msct improves efficiency , image quality and patient comfort of " routine " - imaging of the chest .    3.0491891249380942
the ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high - quality secondary reconstruction .    3.503004165737888
if a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired , msct for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high - resolution ( hrct ) sections from the same set of thin - collimation UNK data .    3.372959859079442
this way , contiguous chest images of superior and hrct sections of equal image quality compared to conventional ct scanning can be obtained .    3.036896354878982
vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of msct : for imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli ( pe ) , the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced .    3.586837052603451
if indicated , the entire UNK venous system can be evaluated during the same session , without additional contrast material .    3.5443902017091307
abstract basis of the modern shoulder implants is the neer ii - system , a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with UNK radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation .    3.4372930089446183
the second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the neer ii prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head - and shaft - sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation - translation - mechanism .    3.2448262228969034
the third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the UNK UNK of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation .    3.5629902032866463
the latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3 - dimensional UNK to independently adjust the UNK head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry .    3.266694065042713
besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface .    3.385972169270156
a hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head , which UNK the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal .    2.8867545612611445
bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi - rotational head system .    3.1915772224514765
their indication is limited to pre - existing lesions of the rotator cuff and / or the glenoid surface .    4.000637462050915
the inverse total shoulder prosthesis UNK the articular surface morphology of the humeral head and the glenoid .    3.600565421000278
the hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component .    2.8630120686816407
this implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences .    3.7294855892226946
the role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration .    2.9404784955773913
a fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus , the centre of rotation , and the anatomical UNK .    3.9609448067008546
positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process .    3.1504655745219816
a failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result .    3.2641763951229676
the shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented , cementless or hybrid techniques .    2.9243569272379437
today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist .    2.939324617689655
their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the UNK - and the peg - shaped glenoid components .    3.544064573969561
the peg - shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear - forces .    2.7776026454890386
cementless glenoid components consist of a UNK inlay and a surface treated metal - back with an integrated fixation system .    3.557559350540234
these fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self - cutting UNK - screw - systems .    3.025387117548142
the critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the pe - inlay and the metal - back because of high force development .    3.04000116469689
the question of implanting a hemi - or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface , which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease , and the age of the patient .    3.762712430548573
preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work - up - x - ray , ct or mri - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology .    3.3232148576000444
g . UNK UNK the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations .    4.194965983931858
to compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi - and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement .    3.14805967381756
looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis .    4.183801882401462
the neer total shoulder prosthesis has a 15 year survival rate of 87 % , compared to 74 % of the hemi - prosthesis .    4.00361192653497
the objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components , especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures .    3.9947422848194356
another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components .    3.325710961511304
a fairly new research - field is the computer - assisted surgery , e . g . navigation systems and robotics .    3.249957519577023
the computer - assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane ( inclination and UNK ) of the humeral head .    3.7027285418093934
the use of a surgery - robot could be very helpful to UNK achieve the desired conformity of the articular surface when preparing the glenoid .    2.9193727330005768
two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on .    3.436900379772536
one case is well documented .    3.570112389283349
in both cases there was very good functional adaptation , resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement .    3.171751036483583
the rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage .    3.368962930154089
the function of the UNK muscle is also discussed .    3.5760530683550966
johann friedrich dieffenbach ( UNK - 1847 ) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery .    3.534625642443235
one focus of his work , apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques , was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery .    3.0401049187817692
this special aspect of plastic surgery as well as dieffenbach ' s biography is presented in this historic article .    3.075001923517822
when a UNK person is found in a bath UNK , the emergency physician is UNK to give medical assistance .    4.093924769747041
if the patient is dead on arrival , the manner of death will in most cases unsettled .    3.1047937952189235
in these cases the physician should inform the police immediately .    2.9578645223376707
any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided .    3.3757960079628906
the purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic - endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer .    2.5065531694044973
these procedures were applied to 29 patients .    3.656652057503014
laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion - lifting method , by which a wedge resection is made while UNK up the full - thickness gastric wall , was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall , lesser curvature , and greater curvature of the stomach .    3.5338480976285256
on pathological examination of resected specimens , the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients .    2.989301753657746
the histological depth of the lesions was m ( mucosal cancer ) in 15 patients and sm1 ( slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer ) in one .    3.115314770274979
this one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found .    3.204115140550368
oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( + / - sd ) of 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 8 days after operation , and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12 . 3 + / - 3 . 4 days .    3.463860522900958
the 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection .    3.0993034832307145
laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage .    4.502485681684467
the surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful .    3.089593123856371
lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2 , both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region , total gastrectomy was avoided , and careful observation is continued .    3.4798865842005875
oral nutrition was resumed 4 . 0 + / - 1 . 6 days after operation , and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12 . 0 + / - 3 . 5 days .    3.271469904127581
in addition , no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure , and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow - up period of 460 months .    3.2721549958177554
selected properly , these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer .    3.118292429036457
between 1988 and 1997 , tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients ( group 1 : 36 - 72 gy , 83 implants ) and 22 nonirradiated patients ( group 2 : 92 implants ) in the mandible and floor of the mouth , and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation .    3.318411110731903
a total of 23 patients were treated with exclusively implant - supported prostheses , and 16 with implant tissue - supported constructions .    3.104448604391783
between 1988 and 1991 , group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue - supported prostheses ( using two to four implants ) .    2.940091845606797
due to prosthesis - related pressure lesions , the strategy has now been changed .    3.1985115910723803
since 1992 , group 1 patients have received exclusively implant - supported prostheses ( using five to six implants ) , while group 2 patients have received implant tissue - supported constructions ( using four implants ) .    2.805289760523075
special criteria for the success of implant - supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up .    3.8202241991121832
with an average follow - up period of 37 months , 160 UNK ( 91 % ) were clinically osseointegrated .    3.405079547443707
however , only completely implant - supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers .    2.8009153884003943
the overall success rate was about 77 % after 7 years in group 1 and about 87 % after 9 years in group 2 .    3.4002872389054555
with regard to implants placed after strategy change , the 5 - year success rate was approximately 86 % ( group 1 ) and 94 % ( group 2 ) .    3.4421703119324354
in irradiated patients , an exclusively implant - supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact ( thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop UNK ) should therefore be fabricated .    3.3140565109262403
implant tissue - supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients .    3.2513151907085445
extracorporal shock wave therapy ( eswt ) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment .    3.1876295078398678
we have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method .    3.223401744621271
in a prospective UNK study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months .    3.226593448886346
following 2 cycles of eswt with 2000 impulses / 18 kv , the reevaluation was performed at 1 , 3 and 6 months after treatment .    3.300934978447495
a total of 27 pseudarthroses was UNK , in 11 one or more UNK had been performed prior to eswt .    3.7333643054910284
following eswt we found a success rate of 41 % ( n = 11 ) .    3.8739262860990284
the clinical evidence of subjective , clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month , in all of these patients within a period of 3 months .    3.342127289372463
radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month , in all of these patients within 6 months .    2.7462736127161214
eswt appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion .    4.129472755324582
if no improvement occurs , the maximum delay of UNK is three months .    3.430536143905862
over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non - colorectal , non - neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients ( 73 women , 54 men ; median age 53 years ) .    3.3610866882906354
there were 120 first , 14 second and 6 third liver resections .    3.0776017728514566
primary tumors were : breast cancer ( n = 34 ) , leiomyosarcoma ( n = 20 ) , pancreatic cancer ( n = 16 ) , renal cell carcinoma ( n = 13 ) , melanoma ( n = 9 ) , gastric cancer ( n = 9 ) , lung cancer ( n = 6 ) and adrenal cancer ( n = 6 ) and UNK tumors ( n = 14 ) .    3.401269310927529
extrahepatic tumor manifestation ( including synchronous primary tumors ) was found in 69 / 140 cases ( 49 % ) ; 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor ( 51 % ) .    3.6151075082051944
in the 120 first liver resections , 82 ( 68 % ) r0 , 13 ( 11 % ) r1 and 25 ( 21 % ) r2 UNK were possible .    2.959999067388169
median survival after first liver resection was 20 months ; after r0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after r1 / 2 resection of 8 months was achieved .    3.024067421947962
the 5 - year survival rate was 16 % for the total group , 24 % in patients with r0 resection and 0 % for r1 / 2 resections .    3.62724266545049
morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32 . 5 % and 5 . 8 % , respectively .    3.9300406749217487
in patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months ( 5 - year survival rate 25 % ) and 7 months was achieved after r0 resection and r1 / 2 resection , respectively .    3.483166575793933
in case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months ( 5 - year survival rate 23 % ) for r0 resection compared to 8 months after r1 / 2 resection .    3.248516372211115
these data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a r0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection .    3.452049515738814
we conclude that patients with liver metastases of non - colorectal , non - neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection .    3.284893490800029
similar to colorectal metastases , a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases .    2.810476684232375
even in more unfavorable tumor entities , several cases of long - term survival were observed after surgical therapy .    3.486938438419139
therefore , the indication for liver resection should be considered carefully in every single case .    2.898025953565719
UNK about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow - up .    2.7733956037948335
the present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long - term psychotherapy , typically UNK oriented , in private practice .    3.4430934349289504
the design was a three - wave panel comprising more than 700 patients .    3.2333646382368046
at the end of the third wave , UNK patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample .    3.3435415405787934
the findings emphasize the importance of extended follow - up .    3.2959045346886677
when therapist variables are considered , therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome .    3.0297875068436455
especially positive were high age and many years , in private practice , after licensing .    3.293429000793435
therapeutic UNK and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups , one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support , UNK etc .    3.1182131340881374
therapists in the classically psychoanalytic cluster were found to do poorly with patients in psychotherapy , in contrast to patients in psychoanalysis .    3.825386322010955
it is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different .    2.5587133474254005
experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .    3.088518977748434
the austrian immunoglobulin in multiple sclerosis ( aims ) study tested this assumption by examining UNK patients with relapsing - remitting ms in a randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled fashion ( 75 ivig , 73 placebo ) .    2.916018327487476
monthly administration of ivig in a dosage of 0 . 15 - 0 . 20 g / kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24 % of patients and almost UNK the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment .    4.123501867550387
therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability ( mild neurological UNK without disability to ambulatory with assistance ) at study entry .    3.5605647792596287
overall the magnitude of treatment effects of ivig was comparable to that reported for beta - interferon and UNK 1 .    3.380915862472576
further ongoing studies will have to clarify the future role of ivig in the treatment of ms , in particular in the progressive forms of the disease .    3.59166507026412
spontaneous coronary artery dissection is a rare cause of ischemic heart disease .    2.9564260945082035
incidence , etiology and optimal treatment are ill - defined .    3.1729055972274645
between july 1995 and december 1997 , we prospectively identified 42 patients ( 36 men , six women , mean age 59 + / - 12 years ) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among UNK consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time ( incidence 1 . 1 % ) .    3.5629285642019024
in comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris ( 8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among UNK patients ; incidence : 0 . 3 % ) , the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction ( 13 / 450 ; 2 . 9 % ) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina ( 21 / UNK ; 4 . 2 % ) .    3.4113556374244887
dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery ( 19 cases ) , followed by the right coronary artery ( 15 cases ) and the left circumflex coronary artery ( 8 cases ) .    4.481233702482681
because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 13 patients to confirm the diagnosis .    3.3341418664115627
the presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in 35 cases , heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case .    2.945546480159279
in two cases , no obvious risk factor could be identified .    2.877705956767171
therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients ( including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction ) , coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty ( ptca ) in seven patients .    3.3128718143130538
three patients were treated conservatively .    3.5689687995672696
introduction : since the introduction of laparoscopic hernioplasty the tapp procedure ( transabdominal preperitoneal approach ) has become the most widely used technique .    3.3374098256290425
many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach ( tep ) , because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion .    3.2396867750891625
method : we evaluated our results with tapp in a retrospective study , with special attention to complications caused by the approach .    3.9004972380062135
we operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years .    3.372142841564644
results : complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after tep .    3.2046308452426437
there was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years .    2.8262445723591574
there were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias , the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter .    3.351553918937327
conclusion : we see no reason to change from tapp to the tep technique .    2.779966764211272
this article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines , automatic UNK machines ( atms ) and telephone cards by the elderly in four european regions .    2.814706240245098
the analyses are based on data from an international project entitled " keeping the elderly mobile " , collected in mannheim ( former west germany ; n = 404 home - dwelling respondents ) , chemnitz ( former east germany ; n = 400 ) , UNK ( italy ; n = 600 ) , and UNK ( finland ; n = 618 ) .    3.3485665271659335
the random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country .    3.0806463927386236
two generations of men and women ( aged 55 - 74 and 75 + years , respectively ) participated in the study .    3.07642009569615
the most frequently used devices were atms in chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in mannheim .    2.4650193279987427
on the basis of logistic regression analysis , age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions , i . e . , the users were mostly the " young - old . "    3.1875205154142616
education was a more important variable than gender .    3.9213630688692036
in all four regions , the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier ; nevertheless , ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in mannheim .    2.786508921269884
interesting differences and similarities among the UNK were also found .    3.621866056965445
the present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth .    2.789055906203664
in order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression , a single - blind placebo - controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out .    3.3186164745970888
all patients were UNK treated with the UNK antidepressant mianserin .    3.65537995012808
the verum group ( n = 22 ) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression .    3.842971120570836
the placebo group ( n = 24 ) was treated with acupuncture at non - specific locations and the control group ( n = 24 ) received only pharmacological treatment .    3.634986962286142
acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks .    3.6396984155173198
psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum / placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the cgi , gas , UNK and UNK rating scales .    3.2630046238223582
additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself .    3.415370768301896
however , we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture .    3.0011373655260343
acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure , acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock .    3.1295019736999534
while decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated .    3.201690961169885
cardiogenic shock , however is still a therapeutic challenge .    3.5500585869866947
for therapy of cardiogenic shock positive UNK , phosphodiesterase - inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use .    3.139338155492466
if it is not possible to correct underlying diseases , mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high .    3.6693301424822877
two years after the diagnosis of UNK syndrome , a 50 - year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet , leading to acral necrosis .    3.505673158585334
another 59 - year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet , secondary to ischemia .    3.922650895828804
this was the first symptom of a t - cell - chronic lymphocytic leukemia .    3.2746311387475737
similar cases have only occasionally been described .    3.3511840911293835
the relationship between acral ischemia and t - cell - lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article .    3.5450231683685813
the clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in UNK - tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast - enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma .    3.0998224715813643
we report our findings in a 57 - year - old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma .    3.0532632411837786
a large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits .    3.082707402429787
both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate UNK of a lymphoma .    3.3542532013319195
the development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an UNK - UNK occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma .    3.515097484320972
such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car - UNK symptoms require further diagnostic measures .    3.532544526910336
manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare .    3.5802438120423097
to our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with sjögren ' s syndrome has never been reported before .    3.55639501634306
cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin , particularly the problem of vital , UNK , UNK or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value .    3.9306410479788774
the aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters , including UNK plants and animals , drugs and toxic substances .    2.823920254782433
the time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected UNK relevant cases .    3.538042986437961
the purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol ( p ) or methohexital ( m ) for elective magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in children with respect to safety , side effects , recovery , and discharge time .    3.1871512715797974
pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion .    3.4370373177955154
nevertheless , thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications .    3.353380858965652
of these , the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare , but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications , and they have an extremely poor prognosis .    3.1231730961716737
within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas .    3.6379967233683037
in 22 patients ( 6 . 1 % ) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis .    3.7760288687146972
two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery .    4.229777664411447
one patient died : the other survived but was severely disabled .    2.8693341376459136
the latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned .    3.1699916542293196
these UNK examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated .    3.339846862992746
local selective ( or UNK ) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure , provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications .    3.481816594929031
we report on a 61 - year - old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease .    2.565021170934365
the congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of ( post - UNK ) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life .    4.054442053949225
it was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization .    3.496311861085527
due to its high prevalence , atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice .    3.555613424604942
the chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system .    3.2130051061097427
we describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our department of dermatology .    3.3764097417975845
a high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care .    3.7422367499493148
the aims of this clinic are an optimized outpatient management of atopic dermatitis , the UNK of epidemiologic data , the performance of controlled studies , and potentially the reduction of costs .    3.7028554495833697
abstract : traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head - injured patients .    3.0618029684300234
we present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the a1 / UNK junction .    3.4202805177019298
purpose : although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago , the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear .    3.1433017510481283
recent oct studies have shown UNK spaces in connection with the disc .    3.667400483948421
none of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven .    2.961757072716956
besides the hypothesis of UNK , the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion .    3.7004764754225725
we describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic UNK that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow - up of 26 months .    2.7473267954238065
the purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits .    2.940491354562981
sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion , which was not recognized until a few years ago .    3.7865954711886896
as in sclerosing adenosis of the breast , a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate .    3.0996043133657674
an incidence of 2 . 8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands .    4.03894328579866
as demonstrated in this case report , the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate .    3.6619998707803836
important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation , which is demonstrated by cytokeratin UNK , and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation , with expression of s - 100 and / or smooth muscle actin .    4.342925698270816
these antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate .    3.3747933244164967
nevertheless , in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible , even after the application of immunohistochemical methods .    3.6229076288244157
further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis , atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate .    2.6136591946197774
benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to " malignant " complications , so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance .    3.1935140495881593
the postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases ; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed .    3.052996666163404
the main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea .    3.313143674200392
in 8 cases an embolic event occurred .    3.21287050210055
all patients underwent extirpation of the tumor .    2.9364476401538866
early mortality was 10 % , while late mortality was 4 % .    3.4156880750507566
the treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation , which , due to unpredictable embolic complications , is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface .    3.3613744996656583
in such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance .    2.763770433194066
we present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive UNK .    3.299367288082678
radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung .    4.803150111472958
biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium UNK tumor cells UNK with some histiocytes .    3.2170710911999065
malignant melanoma of the bronchus was included in the differential diagnosis .    2.970390650997985
a thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed .    3.265115074547076
the lung is an uncommon localisation of UNK with so far three reported cases .    3.6819450403350364
lipoma , leiomyoma and UNK have to be included in the differential diagnosis .    3.9428304137923247
the peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express hmb - 45 .    3.2409106925475593
this has not been reported yet .    3.3609644760650936
this UNK life span , also known as " hayflick limit " , is probably defined by a " critical " length of the telomeres .    3.20789274842645
telomeres are special dna - sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle .    3.208532159382479
cells of most , but not all malignant tumours have been shown to UNK the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed , " hayflick limit " can be overcome , and unlimited cell division can be established .    3.461831753834713
this study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase UNK is used by uveal melanoma cells .    3.123917317792964
a total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal ( mp ) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985 ; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years .    3.159808029362881
of 59 patients with acute injuries , 52 were painfree with full stability of the mp joint ; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability .    3.585714790267762
nevertheless , the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired .    2.8974164766108026
the results of follow - up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective .    3.5750846717873417
the purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography ( sct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in the preoperative work - up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma , regarding local resectability and vascular involvement .    3.14681419935039
methods and materials : a total of 28 patients ( 19 men and 9 women ; mean age 58 years ) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study .    3.901843945588636
all patients prospectively underwent mri ( + / - gadolinium - dtpa ) and sct ( 3 - phase examination ) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies , and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days , irrespective of the mri or sct findings .    3.600339453340791
sct and mr studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists , without knowing the results of the surgical exploration .    3.7261994153251363
standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy .    3.410233822345182
results : laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable .    3.318131943016503
in 17 of 18 non - resectable carcinomas mri and sct were able to obtain correct information about UNK ( sensitivity 94 % ) , in 7 ( mri ) , resp .    3.3752368915588264
8 ( sct ) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable ( sensitivity 70 % for mri and 80 % for sct ) .    3.5185307172504863
the presence of vascular involvement was depicted by sct with a sensitivity of 82 - 100 % and 62 - 100 % by mri .    3.322055938936682
the specificity varied between 85 - 100 % for sct and 77 - 100 % for mri .    3.4096917149654584
conclusion : both mri and sct are good techniques for the preoperative work - up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability .    3.6119262367294995
pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis , with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 % .    3.803036576832289
the incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 % .    3.5696605596024216
pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions .    3.6702831592231724
careful diagnostic work - up including ercp and ct scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts .    3.354334116691326
the indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications .    4.054155847329533
pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients , and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 % .    4.044820785512457
pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an UNK of chronic pancreatitis .    3.8086668675907003
pancreatic resection therefore represents a causative treatment .    2.944099083911188
new percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous UNK of the surgeon .    3.737769681376965
however , so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures .    3.434182753629382
therefore , in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice .    3.3608700464460513
a 28 - year - old drug UNK who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis ( simultaneously : hepatitis a , persistent hepatitis b , hepatitis c and superinfection by delta hepatitis ) .    2.8372500407659746
liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive UNK UNK , compatible with a delta virus infection .    3.3476528473728617
moderate pulmonary fat embolism ( grade i - ii according to UNK ) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages .    3.714538712054535
it is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing UNK may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism ; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in UNK by alveolar macrophages .    3.0601245681687685
suicide on railways ( either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train ) is one of the ' UNK ' suicide methods .    3.2614826950157543
in austria , UNK suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994 .    2.667316899949972
this amounts to 5 . 73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men .    3.6286947287557956
in both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups ; the mean age was higher in women than in men ( 48 . 0 vs 40 . 4 years ) .    3.844070986045635
there was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides .    2.5421985741520103
UNK the mass media to treat the subject of ' suicide ' with reserve and with greater caution , even when not presenting a distinct suicide model , may be of importance in general suicide prevention .    3.330720269746432
for decades the results of elective lymph node dissection ( elnd ) are differently discussed , so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can ' t be neglected .    3.369420781554611
since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma - probe guided sentinel UNK ( slne ) on patients with melanoma from a breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward , after UNK a UNK 99m - tc labelled tin ( ii ) - UNK solution around the tumor or the scar , if the tumor has been UNK before .    3.107214974252349
by this method , that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage i or ii ( uicc ) but even histopathologically to a stage iii and who are UNK of a removal of the regional lymph nodes , the sentinel node can be exactly localised , tissue - sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity .    3.3788207364762357
when finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows .    3.6919404962184394
during rehabilitation of patients suffering from a recent hip fracture , we evaluated the development of several aspects of their subjective well - being ( n = 87 , age : 70 to 94 ) .    4.0368132256555525
in most cases , a deterioration of subjective well - being due to the consequences of the hip fracture could be prevented ; the well - being improved in most cases .    3.686792830352349
antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non - cognitive symptoms including agitation , aggression and UNK .    3.384182614179276
as patients are usually elderly , a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants .    3.2900532717891826
new antidepressants such as the UNK and the reversible UNK inhibitors should be the first - line agents in these patients , because their efficacy is not different from that of classic UNK , but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects , ease of use and safety .    3.8589145076452525
improvement in cognitive performance , however , may not be expected from the new antidepressants .    4.055505760189881
for the treatment of agitation , aggression and UNK , UNK and benzodiazepines are in frequent use , although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens .    3.388457280996208
good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram .    3.0809545504085887
all medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples , so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously .    3.121923908931747
the application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule .    3.554246790548581
primary clinical results of combined laser - assisted capsular shrinkage ( lacs ) and multiple suture repair ( caspari ) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented .    3.043840131637812
from july 1997 to october 1998 , 18 patients ( 2 female , 16 male ; mean age 27 . 9 years ; range 16 - 42 years ) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure .    3.4831546554713806
the operative technique involved the use of UNK sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule ( caspari ) and lacs .    2.7451997083583017
laser energy was applied using a ho : yag laser ( 10 w , 1 j , 10 pulses / s , total energy : 1500 - 2000 j ) .    2.930207823798116
the patients were followed for an average of 9 months ( range 4 - 20 months ) .    3.5777372412735544
from june 1992 to UNK 1996 , arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients ( 2 female , 15 male ; age 25 . 9 years / range 18 - 37 years ) .    3.2703786068462772
the average follow - up in this group was 4 . 5 years ( range 2 - 5 . 5 years ) , and we found 41 . 2 % ( 7 / 17 ) recurrent dislocations .    4.567894216042896
after combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair ( caspari ) and lacs , a significantly ( chi - squared test , p = 0 . 05 ) lower recurrence rate was obtained .    2.908324477028536
only in one patient ( 5 . 6 % , 1 / 18 ) did we find this failure .    3.9536195580685893
no complications occurred in either group .    2.4528046677318
the combination of arthroscopic lacs and caspari ' s technique of multiple suture repair in cases of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability and recurrent dislocations is promising .    2.9980951123546253
although , no long - term results are available , the method seems to be suitable for UNK low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery .    3.841472651939373
simple bone cysts are asymptomatic , benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph .    3.1887202790067812
etiology and treatment are controversially discussed .    3.9891504202145174
the UNK status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made .    3.1580952990659124
we present a case report of an intact UNK bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma .    3.0429699318315793
several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested .    3.4043783137936314
the question whether treatment is UNK necessary is controversially discussed .    3.0151215054928833
it is the author ' s opinion , that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment .    2.844100058856936
facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis .    3.2111579177036584
in the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated .    3.367219669306393
twenty healthy subjects underwent four UNK tests at intervals of one week .    3.263264966198975
the study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females .    3.146454006532508
ages ranged from 23 to 36 years .    3.2694718170224695
the stimulation intensity required for UNK stimulation was 14 . 6 ma on average .    3.421598956944292
the mean of the intra - individual side - to - side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32 . 5 % .    2.9596702574873177
the hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data .    2.9460704027385183
as with previous investigators we found significant side - to - side differences in healthy subjects .    3.425006812712908
furthermore , we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements .    3.080834154528919
we conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography .    3.2002604308865963
to compare patient dose and image quality of electron - beam - ct vs . spiral - ct by means of phantom measurements .    3.3208262499000947
an ebct scanner ( c - 150 UNK ) and a spiral - ct scanner ( ge UNK advantage ) were used to scan three different UNK .    3.695842774049661
administered dose , high contrast ( hc ) resolution , low contrast ( lc ) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured .    3.1618639395169126
ebct showed 25 - 35 % lower hc resolution in comparison to spiral - ct . lc lesion detectability showed equivalent results for s / n vs . patient dose using 3 mm collimation with ebct and spiral - ct , whereas spiral - ct was superior for 1 , 5 and 6 mm collimation .    3.1709793123489125
dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using ebct with 1 , 5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral - ct using equivalent scan parameters .    3.334114292691861
no differences were seen using 3 mm collimation .    2.8012831979451196
differences were due to insufficient UNK collimation of the ebct .    3.1305184778929265
the use of ebct with 6 mm collimation should be avoided , because of impaired performance .    3.4191633529138596
using 3 mm collimation , ebct showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral - ct despite lower hc resolution .    2.969946972965016
in an experimental study , the biomechanical qualities of the combined kirschner wire osteosynthesis ( kwo ) in the unstable colles ' fracture were analyzed .    2.8895389003323286
it represents a modification of UNK ' s dynamic kwo , UNK for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static kwo .    3.603372175790116
clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results , was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined kwo and its single components should be UNK .    3.71324259396647
simulation of the unstable colles ' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material .    3.17158315207253
this fracture model was subsequently UNK using the different kwo types and tested by a standardized vector energy testing device regarding its stability in the four main loading directions .    3.2101395703627813
the combined kwo UNK the advantage of volar stability of the conventional kwo with the high dorsal stability of dynamic kwo .    3.630669109761768
the main functional principle of dynamic kwo with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission .    2.9885429687003096
besides its good stabilization , dynamic kwo also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment .    3.1320259847395646
furthermore , the experiments yielded important information about technical aspects of the surgical procedure , which helps us to avoid anatomical and functional deficiencies .    3.153825046066544
based on these experimental findings , the surgical technique of combined kwo was standardized .    3.463379384773649
purpose : it is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map UNK refraction .    3.258184038860379
this is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied .    3.808370660092863
we present the case of a 2 - year - old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive UNK of the face .    3.329141748780158
the clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child .    3.2393713973935307
because of the morphological findings the medico - legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven .    2.823331822257976
during the criminal proceedings at the UNK court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico - legal expert became obvious .    3.331446400799081
findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and UNK of water and the influence of UNK in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment .    4.244706716385877
the opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be UNK .    3.643355940242456
during the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an UNK " in UNK pro UNK " .    3.3285789996145354
anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients .    3.7702358727304466
lesions treated were located between t4 and l3 , most frequently occuring at UNK / l2 .    3.2445399179245524
operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure .    3.047784883777071
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure .    3.003037904966344
one positioning related pressure harm on the UNK nerve and one irritation of the UNK root at the entrance site were both UNK .    3.954703561330659
postoperative control by x - ray and UNK showed correct positioning of the bone graft , as well as the fixation device in all patients .    3.9501344635695217
our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method .    3.2629015926518763
major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach , postoperative pain reduction , early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay .    3.6002003002171516
in order to restore function and UNK in mandibular hypoplasia , transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively .    3.348384563143797
in a retrospective study the indication , growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared .    3.083434300029254
in total , 12 patients ( 4 - 14 years old ; 7 female , 5 male ) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts ( 7 costochondral , 5 iliac crest ; observation period 4 - 9 years ) .    3.1406404222734743
in 5 patients ( 10 - 12 years old ; 1 female , 4 male ) , distraction osteogenesis was performed ( observation period 10 months to 3 1 / 2 years ) .    3.4063331322870543
in the results , according to the literature , the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably , approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases .    3.354641982606666
on the other hand , all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected .    3.1653389942488763
after osteochondral grafts , adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases .    3.350584579886386
therefore , the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia , where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device , and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary .    3.4844390817598105
in all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children , distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option , even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be UNK .    3.696985920425436
to evaluate the predictive value of mri in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement , a prospective study was performed .    3.581294343121304
twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and / or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast - enhanced mri 2 , 12 , 24 weeks , 1 and 2 years postoperatively .    3.703505693911072
the clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by lysholm , oak and ikdc .    3.304929672070899
the mri scans ( sp 63 , 1 . 5 tesla ) were evaluated regarding the quality and signal intensity of the reconstructed ligament .    3.556851247688542
during the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and UNK of the neoligament in mri was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal / noise of 1 . 1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6 . 9 1 year postoperatively .    4.141985315179224
in 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1 - year postoperative mri , whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability .    3.468235940462234
in the 2 - year postoperative mri , the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement .    3.40393487171128
miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today .    4.273915575599574
apart from easy handling , in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability .    3.3535612530484364
the treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent .    3.40324947387793
titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures .    3.90015060598799
compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry .    3.1522902425120143
the titanium mesh can be adapted and UNK individually in any situation , in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates .    3.2805094438407
as a result , complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent .    3.1324292380761016
non - invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction .    3.3369345725615007
myocardial scintigraphy using thallium - 201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism , using UNK - 18 UNK - UNK , are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability .    3.5852286592729605
besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization , both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events .    3.55457699379453
this short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on UNK diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction .    3.218551858549115
an elderly woman was found dead in her farm house UNK in a pool of blood and was partially UNK .    3.5060148935945863
blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor .    3.4958613876575027
the investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual UNK .    3.7369769307911174
the autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis .    3.4644765954776404
the woman has obviously been UNK by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage .    3.1805466193922696
a similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described .    3.39389391627906
in the ankle ( talocrural ) joint , the lower end of the tibia and fibula UNK the trochlea tali .    3.4580175297017384
thus , an approximately UNK joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg .    3.0070309083869735
due to the geometry of the trochlea tali , UNK lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint .    2.776927945609517
movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments .    3.429637098208307
the posterior articulation is the subtalar ( UNK ) joint ; in the anterior articulation , talar UNK of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the UNK and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar UNK ligament form a concavity for the talar head .    4.27220307858496
thus , the UNK joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a UNK articulation .    3.587985425504327
on the weight - bearing foot , the distal UNK and UNK are UNK and UNK against the talus in order to maintain UNK contact .    4.903434308672451
when the foot is off the ground , these movements are modified to eversion and inversion , also involving the calcaneocuboid joint .    2.713741556618339
in addition , movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during UNK or UNK changes between the fore - and hindfoot .    3.2781461486304897
limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments .    4.282977080907447
finally , the UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground .    3.798960230899428
a case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented .    2.648230184899559
the tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers ( cd 31 , cd 34 , factor viii associated antigen ) and express also histiocytic antigens ( cd 68 , lysozyme , cathepsin d , alpha - 1 - UNK , alpha - 1 - UNK ) as well as cd 8 .    3.204898954587749
this marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of UNK cells angioma .    3.5451826984671992
despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control , many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma .    3.157639980838208
therefore , in the university hospital of kiel , germany , an anaesthesiology - based acute pain service ( aps ) was started in 1985 to improve this situation .    2.9735718390736845
the anaesthesiologist in training who UNK the recovery unit serves as an aps for surgical wards and is supervised by a UNK .    3.345956200779235
the UNK on call are responsible after regular working hours .    3.055494306633115
the activities of the aps are as follows : 1 .    3.2896841824500975
induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients .    3.344765371491273
clinical UNK on all patients receiving epidural analgesia ( ea ) , other forms of regional analgesia , or patient - controlled analgesia ( pca ) every morning and throughout the day if necessary .    3.1106853379281256
additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request .    3.5018124500556844
assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient , quality of analgesia , and side effects .    4.623352449754222
writing orders for further treatment .    3.446439917028763
from 1985 to 1992 , 1947 patients on normal wards were treated ( ea : UNK , pca : 183 ) .    2.9849352766586197
epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0 . 175 % - 0 . 25 % infused continuously with top - ups if needed ( mean 240 mg / day , range 75 - 600 mg ; median duration 7 days , range 1 - 53 , table 1 ) .    3.0106041609206224
since the introduction of an aps , complications of ea such as hypotension ( 1985 / 1986 : 5 . 1 % ; 1987 / 1992 : 0 . 5 % , table 3 ) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly ( table 3 ) .    3.061754579047042
dermal infections were seen in 2 . 6 % of patients , with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases ( 4 . 1 % ) .    5.269703002502505
epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards .    3.3492142769858724
nevertheless , 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred .    3.115867192537376
the overall risk of complications during postoperative ea could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the aps .    3.4846107691351254
for other regional procedures ( e . g . , UNK analgesia ) no complications were recorded .    2.926708072549547
pca was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion ( table 6 ) .    2.9673996485662415
the loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit .    3.0498228346479395
the median duration of pca was 4 days ( range 1 - 23 ) ; the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg / day ( range 3 - 226 mg ) .    3.2264061938608686
two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred .    2.751953397991598
in this period there were 8 potential life - threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy ; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management ( 3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i . m .    3.3645201206511177
piritramide ( UNK resuscitation ) , tramadol , and buprenorphine ; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after UNK intoxication ) .    3.0946164857424363
in those cases the aps was not involved .    3.2251299254395476
there are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an aps , i . e . , i . m .    3.851275576101599
injections of opioids on request , but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported .    3.0456482413181276
since the majority of patients used ea or pca for several days , it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high - dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units .    3.4549998789991214
the introduction of an aps is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards .    2.6713481459789965
this requires standard protocols ( table 7 ) , standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses .    2.8965069614995222
lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally , bilaterally or in combination with other UNK .    3.4024700943790385
using the concept of fronto - orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis .    3.363834806705375
the process involves UNK transversal osteotomy , removal , remodelling and advancement of the occipital region .    2.881449288033434
it allows precise , reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments .    3.1092137688681367
artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy .    3.5674202704587925
the remodelling leads to a well - UNK skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume .    3.794943995770151
this article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients .    3.5509772053890516
melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin .    3.175326287376978
it almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge .    3.2612761165726494
although it usually follows a benign course , local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor .    3.756155158088462
melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery .    3.0715412728719262
10 - 15 % of the lesions recur .    4.9702448456814485
we report the case of a 2 - month - old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the UNK who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to UNK the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation .    3.365571386240325
computer - assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures .    3.3751575873094346
several reports on clinical results of computer - aided screw insertion in the cervical , thoracic , and lumbar spine as well as the UNK - iliac joints are available .    3.63967232567169
they show a significant decrease of screw UNK rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques .    3.844433228445156
over the past years , antioxidants , and particularly vitamin e , have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases .    3.2349090707455974
in rheumatology , interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis .    4.05202931037965
however , the concept of using antioxidant nutrients as potential remedies is not new .    3.1199685750723063
as early as the UNK , first case reports have described beneficial effects of vitamin e in the therapy of osteoarthritis .    4.06531428914336
nonetheless , most of the following studies were not conducted properly , thus , not allowing valid UNK about the efficacy of vitamin e . newer studies with sound methodology have shown a beneficial effect in rheumatic diseases , mainly in the reduction of pain .    3.764208010762841
this paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin e in the treatment of rheumatic diseases .    2.9109874395863526
patient - controlled intravenous analgesia ( i . v . - pca ) represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain .    3.005578225017953
however , in many countries i . v . - pca is rarely used .    2.8907548294083654
recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management .    3.2413720403073953
unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade iii and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage .    3.168687760811867
however , fatigue failure of the distal locking bolts is a frequent complication .    3.8663337323911353
we report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails ( UNK tibial nail / aap , utn / ace , UNK / howmedica , UNK / howmedica , r & t tibial nail / smith & nephew , ao / asif utn / synthes ) .    2.588763569557551
further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were UNK than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail ' s UNK .    3.384159439907907
our results suggest that mobilization with half of the average body weight ( UNK ) allows osseous consolidation without fatigue failure of any of the tested locking bolts .    3.5763052337160763
some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight - bearing in a physiological walking cycle , but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle .    2.809583125076767
voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and / or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections .    3.469612492705895
the urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders , but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction .    3.129372999954958
in the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed .    2.9775850603914447
behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role .    3.182607549698686
therapy is based on behavioural modification .    4.083666823546352
we report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone .    2.634968714848737
dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug .    3.267012346228943
before the introduction of isotretinoin , dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne .    3.4230007238682543
to date , its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described .    2.976461083063113
when hematologic parameters are monitored , dapsone is considered a safe and cost - effective drug , especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available .    3.692616585621853
however , the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study .    2.7512838961921577
anaesthesia both for adenotomy ( at ) and for UNK ( te ) frequently presents a challenge .    3.381485564546035
on one hand , children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of UNK - and UNK ; on the other hand the ent surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the " UNK " in the patient ' s mouth .    3.981779637226063
since the UNK UNK debate in the early 1990s , the question of the best muscle relaxant has UNK hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway .    3.8125232785276184
the concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially UNK with scepticism .    2.82873442242435
following several years ' use of the mask for this purpose in at and te in young children , we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic .    3.726142757438919
the laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation , provided there is close cooperation with the ent surgeon .    3.320403712640828
topical corticosteroids ( cs ) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis , so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected .    3.4431723393945015
however , increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years , and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed .    3.479697649114285
cs must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen , the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men .    3.4561984657567404
contact allergy to cs is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent , corticosteroid - resistant dermatitis .    3.0406697080794953
in general , hypersensitivity to cs is a type i and / or type iv mediated allergic reaction .    3.460465742032582
cross - sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures ( e . g .    2.845651228818482
UNK and tixocortol pivalate ) .    2.8381616450878933
contact allergy to cs can be confirmed by patch - tests , intradermal injection tests or application tests ; because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to 120 h is recommended .    3.0745562269904085
for routine screening the use of the patient ' s own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate .    3.3039674438983084
the development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research .    3.09768496215725
the alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process .    3.4014365195886103
the historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts , these being the UNK " standard alliance " of freud , UNK ' s therapeutic alliance and UNK ' s working alliance , are to be described .    3.8345248694930354
all alliance concepts refer to a general , essentially reality - oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain , which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work .    3.375624678453589
nonetheless , the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference .    3.1654060704431197
the alliances are therefore not faced with the transference , but rather with the resistance .    3.3891587758482493
we report on a 15 - months - old girl with a history of recurrent UNK of the lower eyelid , UNK , UNK and mucositis together with growth - retardation , chronic obstipation and anal prolaps .    3.665911329414092
during a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed .    2.9067219533086557
retrospectively , neutrophil counts were between 0 - 500 / µl from birth on .    2.8528545469979996
bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of UNK at the stage of UNK .    3.5778108089191347
continuous therapy with 10 µg / kg / d of recombinant human UNK - colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) induced 12 - day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts .    3.1670780695509637
there were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines .    2.7856312370166862
growth retardation and prolaps of UNK normalized , and few intercurrent bacterial infections , pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred .    2.858145931945953
a mutation in the g - csf - receptor gene was not found in this patient .    3.702601481054387
after 2 years of therapy , a reduction of UNK - csf dose ( application every 2 days ) lead to a severe neutropenia .    4.231550757159589
we report a 31 - year - old renal transplant patient treated with cyclosporin a who developed an unusual sebaceous gland hyperplasia accompanied by a disseminated follicular spiny hyperkeratosis .    2.9560345151897165
those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs .    3.099362050028885
in some locations UNK hyperkeratosis with authentic hair UNK was found .    2.8534036872884623
the histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair - like UNK either alone or in connection with hairs .    3.563075549327231
the presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated UNK hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders .    2.719766339976422
scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair - like structure of these keratoses .    3.3716640347348257
some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their UNK , which were filled with UNK UNK eosinophilic material , a finding similar to earlier observations .    3.475447422527406
our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin a and that they are apparently dose - dependent .    3.0560306159981514
background : since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation , we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures .    2.9796959021889085
we performed pupil UNK , iridotomy with iris suture , and partial sphincterectomy .    2.872888543146381
reports of accidental UNK - intoxications with plants of the UNK family , in particular UNK - species are well known in pediatric care .    3.9756221038097053
the intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years .    3.0229179958071724
two patients , a 14 - resp .    3.517287459969076
16 - year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from UNK ' s UNK UNK for experimental reasons .    4.005503625774741
patient ' s history in the first UNK patient was not available at the time of admission , a routine immunological drug screening of the patient ' s urine had been negative .    3.96459015576884
in the present case of a granular cell tumor an UNK - UNK resection of the esophagus was performed in a 41 - year - old patient after preoperative diagnosis had suggested esophageal cancer .    3.717068471149052
granular cell tumors ( abrikossoff ' s tumor ) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis .    3.779602423416441
because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor , it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma .    3.4220840284203
in the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes , a correction factor of 1 . 2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood .    3.760554560953823
the reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor .    2.9330155230896673
in a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of UNK samples , which can be considered representative of persons involved in UNK under the drinking and driving act , an average quotient of 1 . 16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1 . 08 and 1 . 21 respectively .    3.6059671067300845
in 96 % of the cases the quotient was between 1 . 13 and 1 . 19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3 % .    3.5494604202269913
from these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed .    3.4574600453213855
in germany , if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient ' s skin disorder is severe or chronic , work - related and requiring a change in occupation , then he or she must issue a UNK ( UNK translated as occupational disease notification ) .    3.47633729485344
the patient ' s consent is not required for this mandatory form , which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed .    3.823809718671953
on the other hand , if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder , or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening UNK of the occupation , then the dermatologist needs only write a UNK ( dermatologist ' s report ) .    3.2241457865435916
the patient ' s permission is required for this less formal document .    3.1456053462182014
bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors .    3.5166651989030178
sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples .    3.565574463437386
like normal hematopoietic cells , tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules .    3.084030893295576
since adhesion UNK play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells , new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions are UNK .    3.154424894006326
with the development of powerful computer systems , computer - assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years .    3.623900893075847
even in the surgical field , computer - and robotic - assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis .    3.205248794148138
this article introduces a computer - and robotic - assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures .    2.805428464172794
the hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man ' s work .    3.4382228710568676
the multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality , sensibility , motor function and stability .    3.499725396909723
in severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor .    3.9710230029383644
in a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand .    3.809707671816598
the cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw .    3.068275753645798
basically , we recommend an extended primary repair .    3.6421586659943594
after the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures .    3.228262616055922
we start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints .    3.4297492194297132
thereafter , suturing of extensor and flexor tendons .    2.8170567225264818
in case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap .    3.2289345337830695
in a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first .    3.5385911922814013
our results in vitality and sensibility are listed .    2.7626942698910377
in the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important .    3.321185261944497
therefore , it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery .    3.0084712391154618
the main complaint about the axillary " lump " was that it was aesthetically UNK , and it was excised .    3.429435557336157
the importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma .    3.013394817447748
early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended .    2.9867559907939047
paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors .    3.544392771239753
the cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood , but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis .    3.54895622185224
because no information is available on the UNK action of docetaxel , the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel ' s antitumor efficacy .    3.554363855320218
four different mouse tumors , two squamous cell carcinomas ( scc - iv ; scc - vii ) and two adenocarcinomas ( mca - 4 ; mca - 29 ) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i . c .    2.9124158849710833
tumor cells ( 5 x 105 ) were injected i . c .    3.2543520369363255
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall , and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 days later .    3.9712963353299346
the mice were treated with docetaxel ( UNK - 31 . 3 mg / kg i . v . )    3.967126570489343
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection .    3.7344758272510026
the number of new blood vessels increased with time .    2.8266364542307922
docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in mcas , but not in sccs .    3.9688794487278005
the reduction was associated with UNK tumor growth .    3.807818258506528
this was not observed for the two sccs .    3.337893401287745
since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel , the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel - responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel ' s destruction of tumor cells .    3.1002908823123025
a patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica - like skin changes .    2.8138088911971244
just as in the autosomal recessive disorder , acrodermatitis enteropathica , the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency .    3.455460680279435
replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement .    3.2087433309683044
a measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants .    2.931691205095912
the implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the UNK and the inner ear .    3.175957820915744
a defined signal within the frequency range of 0 - 5 khz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is measured by a probe microphone .    3.125769973082271
displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm .    3.108403535511486
the transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal .    3.276516408266783
this work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound - transmission of middle ear implants .    2.851498624826006
in acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to ptca regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events .    3.057608969313005
it is , however , uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting .    3.2613623202045816
we , therefore , assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary ptca and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result ( provisional stenting ) .    4.025700055635283
in order to perform accurate low - flow anaesthesia ventilation , it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow ( fgf ) and inspiration duration ( id ) on the resulting minute volume ( mv ) .    3.416067089526568
the sulla 808v anaesthesia ventilator ( draeger , UNK , germany ) is originally not equipped with a fresh - gas decoupling ( fgd ) device .    3.1213413372354304
recently , a low - cost fgd device ( UNK , bern - UNK , switzerland ) has been developed , which can be inserted into the circle system .    3.925097389472471
we investigated the effect of this device on mv in the sulla 808v anaesthesia apparatus .    2.706524655378429
the diagnosis prader - UNK - syndrome ( pws ) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of UNK UNK .    3.534034746626092
craniofacial abnormalities like narrow UNK diameter , UNK shaped palpebral fissures and UNK UNK mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary .    3.171175192852926
hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys ( for example UNK ) are common and unspecific signs at that age .    3.407546291199904
typical features like obesity and UNK , small hands and feet and small stature are not expressed until the second year .    3.5073014211787195
the clinical course of pws in the neonate is demonstrated in two cases .    2.990121906128246
diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed .    3.47038526096975
hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in pws has to be taken into consideration .    2.958481431667782
diagnosis - related groups ( drgs ) are an instrument for classification of inpatient cases .    3.4485940684848444
drgs are finding ever broader implementation internationally .    3.1810379704191925
targets for using drgs are hospital financing and budgeting , cost accounting and quality assurance .    3.14623537713534
the present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far drgs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes .    2.761809186210097
in addition to drg - based reimbursement , further quality assurance is necessary , but this is only being implemented with UNK .    3.0549394156377594
the coverage planned for all inpatient cases through drg - based reimbursement in germany from UNK on is a pioneering challenge internationally .    2.861340201848411
background : by law , applicants for driver ' s UNK not only have to have sufficient vision , but also have to use this sight reliably .    3.2326709359746135
the nystagmus patient takes advantage of UNK induced head turns and other forms of compensation .    3.2508473664613122
in the approved test procedures he is deprived of such UNK .    2.9839534855158005
UNK the introduction of the bladder drainage technique , the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000 / year worldwide .    3.388795007486765
most of these transplants have been performed in the united states .    3.1547110988904197
in contrast , the number of pancreas transplants performed in the UNK community has remained at a low level for several years .    3.428471443345173
the results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas / kidney grafts ( spk ) performed between june 1994 and october 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83 . 5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved .    2.8915059846602014
therefore spk can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and end - stage renal disease in germany , too .    3.6766164325813846
intubation and positive end expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function , particularly following blunt chest trauma .    3.4982135294765575
complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non - invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) have only gained minor popularity .    2.949346757443232
in a prospective study , 30 patients who had suffered blunt chest trauma were treated with cpap administered by mask .    3.3848153456777617
the regime consisted of continuous administration of cpap by a face - mask , with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing .    2.9847463244311703
initially a fio2 of 0 . 33 ( range 0 , 28 - 0 , 38 ) proved necessary .    3.785295397661502
the initial cpap level was 7 mbar ( range 5 - 8 ) with an ( assisted spontaneous breathing ) asb of 15 mbar ( range 13 - 18 ) .    3.226991996154859
fio2 and cpap / asb levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary .    3.0512867072194334
in all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen .    3.0954841567266795
the treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur .    3.0078101711813483
in comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average icu stay was dramatically reduced , principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation .    2.9533635270599348
we conclude that non - invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications .    3.54474075747897
abstract : clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a UNK point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis .    3.9125568612606667
diagnosis should be reached fast , sure and cost - effective with a high sensitivity and specifity .    3.7272011660632636
current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success .    3.3807417349137094
in the present study , we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage , perichondrium , and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu / nu mice .    2.733622087773721
prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor - bb ( pdgf - bb ) , but not transforming growth factor beta - 1 ( tgf - 1 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor , or bone morphogenetic protein - 2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix UNK of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype .    3.2315877454986492
tgf - 1 has also been shown to stimulate UNK by UNK UNK cells like those in the perichondrium .    4.207990813652922
in addition , pdgf - bb has been shown to modulate UNK by resting zone cells implanted in poly ( d , l - lactide - co - glycolide ) ( plg ) scaffolds .    2.80195692863679
in the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation .    3.0131503224756586
scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % plg with a 75 : 25 lactide : glycolide ratio and 20 % modified plg with a 50 : 50 lactide : glycolide ratio ( plg - h scaffolds ) .    2.7203830703512253
for each experimental group , four nude mice received two identical implants , one in each calf muscle resulting in an n = 8 implants : plg - h scaffolds alone ; plg - h scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage , costochondral UNK , or costochondral resting zone cartilage of 125 g male UNK - UNK rats ; plg - h scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37 , 5 ng / ml UNK - bb for 4 h or 24 h before implantation , or with perichondrial cells treated with pdgf - bb plus 0 , 22 ng / ml UNK - 1 for 4 h and 24 h . at 4 or 8 weeks after implantation , samples were harvested and analyzed UNK for new cartilage formed , area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue .    2.907345015974817
only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study .    3.444262542141651
there was no UNK found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells .    2.351102825476783
pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy .    3.581102463056006
the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time , whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with pdgf - bb was increased .    2.456748850613057
the results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous plg scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non - weight - bearing site .    3.083294563079296
articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for UNK when implanted UNK in this model .    4.113932970135511
bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity .    3.693336639244574
in spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological UNK to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis .    2.5877668754381338
the biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation .    3.6380151651084573
in this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors ( 30 high - grade central osteosarcomas , 6 low - grade osteosarcomas , 8 giant cell tumors , 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts , 5 UNK / UNK , 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans ) were analysed .    3.331472849947167
immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin - embedded tissue sections using the mib - 1 monoclonal antibody .    3.2367346317252936
mib - 1 recognizes the proliferation - associated ki - 67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells .    3.163361098350477
among high - grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation ( average value 30 % ) was found in comparison with low - grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors .    3.935292805959442
this approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high - grade and low - grade osteosarcomas as well as bone - forming intraosseous tumors .    4.0919724049700035
however distinguishing low - grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible , although interestingly , the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans , a purely reactive lesion , was in the range of the values determined for high - grade osteosarcoma .    3.5950058290038065
over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee .    3.205699903915209
among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials , the central bone patellar tendon bone graft , a UNK hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance .    3.2488219624565757
with some limitations , allograft materials can also be used .    3.4077523573830155
each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties , graft fixation and graft incorporation .    2.922440439384199
clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others .    3.388703012480335
when choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered .    3.3633431017692184
for the treatment of multiple ligament injuries and for revision cases , thorough preoperative planning is necessary and modified graft selection may be required .    3.167609927683894
myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions .    3.0248455981215336
frequent causes are intercurrent infections , fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis .    3.8044285960425137
early referral to an experienced UNK is essential .    3.382516253198095
specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors , crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with UNK .    2.94414591824925
infections must be treated UNK .    3.2861126706845316
UNK in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized .    3.7339578218528
in cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties , early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed .    2.9768379478441505
adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications UNK affecting prognosis .    3.341452966883531
whenever it can be achieved , the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long - term management and follow - up of patients with myasthenia gravis .    4.116603243805626
in a retrospective analysis we evaluated 48 patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea .    3.016117641006021
the calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression .    3.5079062737218916
in subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by x - ray or by intraoperative findings , an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed .    3.201160521277783
at follow - up all patients were evaluated according to the constant score .    4.016439219451189
additionally all pre - and postoperative x - rays were reviewed .    3.212269172384673
after surgery the constant score significantly improved .    3.184518598452256
in all cases where acromioplasty was performed , a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved .    3.3537007909994534
the x - ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with UNK borders converted to sharp borders .    3.1610686405270507
there was also no deposit that converted from a transparent appearance to a dense structure .    2.835399671044472
patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the x - ray .    3.0610594771947945
an additional acromioplasty did not improve the results .    2.678749382431472
the aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit .    3.7274006509180806
acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result .    4.241056991389084
preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric UNK ( UNK ( sucralfate , antacids , pirenzepine ) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation ( sucralfate , pirenzepine ) .    3.2730149770763126
thus , the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and icu regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation .    3.1592314589397703
all specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies .    3.0969352325303516
furthermore , pirenzepine has been found to be superior to h2 - antagonists , at least in neurosurgical patients .    2.967816533002015
insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis .    3.358472803185465
the most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric UNK .    2.785940554455183
this may occur in long - term ventilated patients with a gastric ph > 4 and may account for up to 50 % of all nosocomial UNK in certain groups of patients .    3.7734945587538133
mortality is not influenced by antacids or h2 - antagonists , while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality , most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation .    3.2221562761712526
three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy , a 66 - year - old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure .    2.869110106985989
malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion .    3.361092207203488
computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases , and recurrent blood in the UNK was evident .    4.169057929904977
the patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission .    3.073021141400904
autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum ( grade ii ) with metastases to the liver .    3.321430792957855
high - grade immunoblastic non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma of UNK differentiation was diagnosed , located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri - and myocardium .    2.801784290700139
mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma .    3.310059249066165
the lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels , leading to the signs of cardiac failure .    3.763642394489424
the development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high - grade immunoblastic non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination .    3.0443652408631947
malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times .    3.444052783338356
infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance .    3.6610631446473008
for inter - hospital comparison , they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable .    3.4135607915124835
finally , it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general " risk of infection " based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa .    3.4284734758167286
we strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection .    3.403072272482438
the differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned .    3.0772787678586075
for all mentioned " infection rates " it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement .    3.54509137562385
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and computed tomography ( ct ) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint .    2.9009270353818244
before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed , mri is preferred .    3.3849464554553017
for the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on , mri and ct are equivalent .    3.5034702692499744
however , in older children mri may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis .    3.810343053019015
ct in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures , e . g . for planning complex osteotomies .    3.832165733859957
careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures .    3.7465845140748764
this is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non - unions of these carpal bones .    3.5235412263385384
conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options .    3.3348858665889467
out of the patients who underwent surgery from january 1993 to february 1999 42 patients with a scaphoid fracture and 88 patients with a scaphoid non - union were , in addition to standard x - ray examination , examined clinically and by mri pre - and post - operatively .    3.7743922698007184
fractures of the scaphoid were treated by UNK screw UNK .    4.078910616198817
when there is a possibility that tissue samples have been UNK , dna analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly UNK the specimens to a patient .    3.8112934438516657
the use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded dna in formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded samples .    2.498126153849418
a review of 110 children with burkitt ' s lymphoma admitted to the university of nigeria teaching hospital , UNK during a 7 - year period revealed a preponderance of males over females ( 1 . 9 : 1 ) and a peak incidence at five years .    3.6335116891313657
the main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen .    3.1287734778390646
the spinal column , spleen , and lungs were less affected .    3.271566706280006
it is postulated that an interaction between UNK and epstein - barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour .    2.999508507448253
the most effective drug is cyclophosphamide .    3.1367916167821748
a combination of this drug with UNK and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions , but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse .    3.5517279251278087
follow - up of the patients revealed good survival .    3.6325619803408613
the consumption of the jet set drug ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - UNK , abbreviated to mdma ) by young people is increasing markedly .    3.249765353450405
parallel to this developement , there is a large number of reports on severe neurological , psychiatric and medical complications following the use of ecstasy .    3.9495203007010358
seizures are among the most common clinical complications of the cns following the ingestion of ecstasy .    3.527640314467463
the term " mild cognitive impairment " refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes , but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia .    2.9068345714844033
the prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of UNK healthy 60 - 64 year - old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging ( ilse ) .    3.15529288510474
furthermore , the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined .    2.791363487054221
the following prevalence rates were determined : 13 . 5 % for age - associated memory impairment , 6 . 5 % for age - consistent memory impairment , 1 . 5 % for late - life UNK and 23 . 5 % for aging - associated cognitive decline .    3.5379241108884933
subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests .    3.244106856870328
significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales .    2.755699142316331
significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status .    3.2167142045848136
longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts .    3.378625077813413
in a retrospective study , we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion .    3.2366622947554875
group i included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach .    3.0443024012768696
group ii included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach .    3.1473033299329156
group ii showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis l5 / s1 ( 4 % ) , tear of the common iliac vein ( 1 % ) , UNK syndrome ( 4 % ) and reversible l4 nerve - root lesion ( 3 % ) .    4.025132754667594
on the basis of our findings , we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion l5 to s1 or l4 to s1 .    2.8060791365519595
coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis .    3.453425526179797
coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) is performed only in UNK out situations .    3.0583632661487514
the number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and UNK to avoid stent - thrombosis .    3.1418169324204976
within the context of an extensive study of electroconvulsive therapy at the psychiatric clinic of the university of bonn 15 patients suffering from therapy - resistent major depression ( dsm iii - r ) were examined with a detailed psychometric test battery , containing memory - and UNK tests .    3.409367733548484
the test battery had been applied short time before , during and after the treatment with 10 ect applied unilateral over the UNK hemisphere .    3.3859197153945635
comparing the test performances before and 1 - 2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes : a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items , while visual short - term memory and visual - constructive performance showed a significant improvement ( in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side ) .    3.5260059203950442
none of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was UNK short time after the end of the ect - treatment , instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly .    3.104306631412726
between responders to treatment ( 50 % improvement in hamd ) and non - responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected .    3.7247739765490877
the non - responders had in nearly all of the tests some better ( but not significantly ) results despite being older than the group of responders .    3.452933467099952
in this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable alzheimer ' s disease according to UNK - UNK criteria .    3.546498835336523
drawing abilities ( drawing : house , UNK , clock ; rey - osterrieth figure ; UNK : mmst - figure ; rey - osterrieth figure ) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments .    2.8400862300524827
all patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18 - fdg .    2.7731274948568654
drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in mmst scores ( r = 0 . 78 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) - with visuo - spatial short - term memory ( r = - 0 . 69 ; p = 0 . 001 ) , and writing abilities ( r = - 0 . 77 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    3.004257192796658
in the UNK of ad patients UNK and simplifications were typical , whereas UNK rarely occured .    3.57533906286867
in severely demented patients closing - in phenomenons could be de - scribed , too .    2.79777020506523
a subgroup of ad patients with visuo - constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified .    3.2883436521296305
since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in dresden in 1869 , it has seen the practice of dermatology in the UNK sense , with scientific research activity and UNK .    3.371027579047007
the good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development .    3.338258705788079
the traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted : outpatient clinic , x - ray and uv UNK treatment , allergology and occupational dermatology , psychosomatic dermatology , dermatosurgery , and phlebology .    3.1936193325462727
a 12 - year - old girl from UNK with aids ( cdc : p2 UNK ) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection .    3.3293395199065676
she had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from UNK several months before admission .    2.963265026549538
while molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self - limiting disease in immunocompetent persons , a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant UNK occurs with advanced immunodeficiency .    3.0928261755512265
molluscum - like lesions of cryptococci have been described , and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis .    3.514562978525806
further differential diagnoses should include american and african histoplasmosis , and the cutaneous manifestations of UNK infections , of toxoplasmosis and of pneumocystis carinii infection .    3.442107345523922
the search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours .    2.9776678561854535
the vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours , especially for UNK malignant melanoma .    3.4485223965164002
we propose a UNK procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy , which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques .    3.1424307479241884
introduction : the treatment of full - thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily .    3.1942079701603374
current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation ( oct ) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation ( act ) .    3.0911731973132213
methods : with a prospective clinical investigation , at the time being with 2 - year results , we have examined act in comparison to oct in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological ( histology , immunohistochemistry , res ) outcome .    4.324998351162051
results : we found equally good results with both methods in lysholm , meyers and tegner activity scores .    2.7647011905718464
histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after act showed a defect filling in all cases , mainly with fibrous cartilage , while localized areas of UNK regenerative cartilage were documented near the base . we did not see any UNK visible change in the transplants after oct .    3.110245805036964
this case report intends to focus attention on hemodynamic UNK as cause of repetitive involuntary movements ( rims ) as differential diagnosis of simple partial motor seizures .    2.922004923489145
we report two patients with UNK unilateral limb UNK lasting up to several minutes and which could be triggered by UNK , heat or physical exertion .    3.3109188367466813
in both patients , duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery ( ica ) contralateral to the side of the rims .    3.3523216093089228
blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ica occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent .    2.7386108422774966
after elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic .    3.354199721816593
we suggest that in patients with episodes of rims , doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms .    3.5365515025375984
ethylene UNK ( edc ) is used as a solvent and in the rubber , plastic , and insecticide industry .    3.6183369009289943
the fatal adult dose is below 20 ml .    3.194902212392683
poisoning can occur from inhalation , ingestion or skin absorption .    3.3685106299580228
edc UNK almost all cells , but essentially those of the central nervous system , liver , kidneys , and heart .    3.8505159980695023
retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with UNK stromal tumors ( gist ) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital , we tried to answer the following questions : using the current recommendations in the literature , how are the macro - and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted ?    3.628695632407439
which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw , giving special consideration to practice - orientated management of such cases .    3.127560797798122
the patients were 65 , 75 and 88 years old respectively , and in each case the gist manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding .    3.242945189956914
during surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2 . 5 and 8 cm were found .    3.3155165830363087
going through the current literature , a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy .    3.4192549183981127
on the other hand , very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow - up UNK are almost UNK .    3.312472971023567
we conclude that UNK are difficult to diagnose because of their UNK and that their clinical behavior is uncertain .    3.3841954473680587
the potential malignancy , on the other hand , requires a well - founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre - therapeutic staging .    3.5238648593824307
furthermore , initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow - up should be adapted to the risk involved .    3.5251905091474063
the latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required .    2.879106987130406
in animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs .    3.0533716161990574
according to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today , it could potentially be applied in infants in the future , too .    3.760771314033771
however , the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase iii studies to be conducted .    2.7389512659000634
further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems .    3.0587330105123796
taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today , we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support ; however , further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified .    3.409557632703458
the role of elective lymph node dissection ( elnd ) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial .    2.823753731762315
our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of elnd regarding survival and disease - free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities .    3.1856384614449866
by matched - pair analysis , 375 patients treated by wide local excision ( wle ) plus elnd were compared to 375 patients treated by wle only .    3.1097363405146883
there was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups ; however , the disease - free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by wle plus elnd ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.097121196670688
increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1 . 51 - 4 . 0 mm for the wle + elnd group although the difference was not significant ( p = 0 . 14 ) , and disease - free survival was significantly improved in this group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    3.7438426739911397
elnd elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma .    3.399256141700022
our results confirm the findings of several studies that elnd improves the outcome after primary UNK of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness .    3.413368012929416
7 patients ( 5 female , 2 male ; age : 22 - 81 years ; average age = 58 , 1 j ) with recurrent necrotizing UNK - negative , non UNK vasculitis , were enrolled into this study .    3.226974578067988
disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy , and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) - ( dose : 1 , 0 g / kg body weight daily dose 0 , 25 g / kg body weight over 4 consecutive days ) .    3.2245020565739564
all patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen .    3.006701444223943
specifically immediate pain relief was striking .    3.547566695991187
complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving ivig ( 0 , 5 g / kg body weight ) every 4 weeks for one year .    3.7478827258008667
in 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months .    3.0060057238358038
in one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function .    3.283694344248277
however consideration of costs , effectiveness and possible side effects is needed for this therapeutic regime .    3.6807477105619695
after orthopedic surgery , skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in UNK condition due to the following characteristics .    3.7698846620674353
after use of a tourniquet during surgery , the muscle suffers ischemia / reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress , resulting in structural impairment .    3.6460707288290717
the resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy , with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance .    3.1867176626703304
degeneration of muscle fibers as well as regeneration occurs in muscle while still immobilized .    3.815549925549951
after UNK , the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern .    3.400433257327317
high mechanical loading should therefore be avoided , and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery .    3.430731311955264
considering the role of oxygen radicals , supplementation with vitamin e appears generally recommendable .    2.907073023047527
the timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years .    3.7009815972794047
this analysis was based on a literature review of mostly retrospective publications .    3.3392198800809654
data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control , incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer , lung carcinoma , and head and neck carcinomas .    3.56256836127891
the reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control .    3.3208073835245915
however , evaluation of the data was difficult , because in most publications , retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval .    3.4873055260820265
in patients with head and neck carcinomas , there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist , i . e . , close surgical margins , unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose .    2.9801369998952967
in patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy , there are inconsistent reports in the literature .    3.1975884771220393
if additional chemotherapy is necessary , the sequence surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate .    3.4614676476924493
although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences , there may , on the other hand , be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases , if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy .    3.137068723144932
concerning lung cancer , only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval .    4.46756803885562
the treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts , causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the german health care system .    3.2022996613140067
a total of 32 , 500 polytraumatized patients ( pts iii and iv ) are managed in trauma center levels i - iv in germany .    3.1382267914291506
trauma center levels i or ii are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured .    2.9679858034704014
with the baseline calculation of 64 , 000 dm per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the berlin virchow clinic , 6 . 66 million dm primary costs must be spent for treatment .    2.939423307192951
the total annual costs of this center are nearly 24 million dm for emergency cases and 7 million dm fixed costs per year , for a trauma center level i .    3.026330777856289
in europe the distribution of trauma center levels i or ii is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants .    3.0794636080969986
nevertheless , the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions .    2.9069878683752477
this was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers .    4.2838621233318435
less then half of these patients are treated in levels i or ii trauma centers .    3.7267352204469955
the financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers .    3.1628760407183716
to meet this goal a annual treatment rate of 300 - 400 polytrauma patients should be aimed at .    2.9949542885330502
the claim of the american college of surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible .    3.1034734554482197
this report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved .    3.4848630226495922
in the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists ( 6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists ) , all members of the swiss society of bioenergetic therapists ( UNK ) , provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier .    3.4910868584536576
a self - evaluating questionnaire was then constructed , to be answered anonymously , and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997 ; UNK of them could be reached and 142 ( 49 % ) returned it .    3.394139236428767
the questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition , to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems , and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness , cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life .    3.8414413586250347
bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients .    3.410428132990806
regarding the stability of the therapeutic result , 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition .    3.18468049144026
of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy , 16 opted again for a body - oriented psychotherapy .    2.8270767662461718
purpose : in a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using ct - angiography , mr - angiography ( mra ) and digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) .    3.279086621210213
the aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms .    2.720501368014624
" classic " choroidal neovascularization ( cnv ) has a relatively uniform appearance in UNK angiography .    3.0680187625395785
we examined 31 classic cnv patients secondary to age - related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope ( heidelberg retina UNK ) in order to determine icg characteristics of classic cnv .    2.879230937755723
vascular patterns ( 97 % ) , a UNK rim ( 84 % ) , a UNK margin ( 42 % ) , late icg leakage ( 32 % ) and " feeder vessels " were identified in variable frequency .    4.0262659728450245
some of the icg characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity .    3.0919595328492795
UNK " feeder vessels " may be amenable to laser UNK in the presence of UNK cnv .    3.386911719685219
in situ polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and pcr in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in UNK .    2.6585022636938778
these techniques can combine the sensitivity of pcr with the advantage of in situ hybridization to localize specific cellular structures .    3.277950198979221
with optical control of the pcr reaction product in these techniques , false - positive results due to contamination can be minimized .    3.3325340901128557
several working protocols have been established which allow detection of dna and rna sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner .    3.0487048241429826
two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product , the indirect pcr in situ hybridization ( pcrishyb ) , and the direct in situ pcr ( is pcr ) .    3.451528584218115
an easy and reproducible method for pcrishyb and ispcr in formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared .    2.7085120460131282
using both ispcr and pcrishyb , the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue .    3.0236995538415017
indirect pcrishyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct ispcr was the quicker , easier and less expensive method .    2.830481929597508
in a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes .    4.031594065257075
group 1 ( n = 10 ) received monotherapy ( dithranol ( d ) twice a day , d / d ) , group 2 ( n = 10 ) calcipotriol mornings / dithranol evenings ( calcipotriol ( c ) / dithranol ( d ) c / d ) and 3 ( mometasone ( m ) mornings / dithranol ( d ) evenings , m / d ) .    2.958568622591007
during the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the pasi - score as well as infiltration , erythema and desquamation weekly .    3.579126055380942
the m / d group revealed in the first week a significantly faster reduction of the pasi - score ( 5 , 3 ) than in the d / d group ( pasi 13 , 22 ) .    3.512504658185598
the c / d group ( pasi 10 , 5 ) show a not significantly faster reduction .    3.203822874211087
after 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar pasi - scores in all groups .    3.378829192290422
there were less side - effects in the m / d group than in the others .    3.53633079985849
in the long term , the effects were similar .    3.559411957484268
this report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory - nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury .    2.7165160829137394
subsequent to trauma there was segmental , UNK or UNK hypoaesthesia with refractory , UNK painful symptoms .    3.5391170588718177
none of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present .    3.124234601105907
" normal " therapy resulted in more severe symptoms .    3.4315385477261064
depending on the distribution of the hypo - or anaesthesia , there were also efferent symptoms ( coordination problems , impairments of proprioception , etc . ) .    2.9516212476591224
the pharynx , being part of the UNK as well as the respiratory system , is embedded in the complex spatial anatomy of the neck and , due to its function and location , represents a very sophisticated region .    4.326817619759362
cisatracurium ( UNK , UNK , UNK - UNK ) , an intermediate - acting non - depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent , is a UNK of atracurium .    4.148309995024257
methods : after approval by our institutional review board , 62 patients ( asa i - ii ) were randomly assigned to three groups to receive either 3xed95 or 5xed95 cisatracurium , or 3xed90 vecuronium as a rapid bolus .    2.145767397067255
after premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam , anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone ( 4 - 12 mg / kg ) and maintained with o2 / n2o and isoflurane ( 1 . 5 - 2 vol . % ) .    2.3613083432594046
six minutes after thiopentone , the patients received the relaxant , and after further 6 min 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated .    3.1419470997567744
heart rate ( hr ) and blood pressure ( bp ) were monitored every minute .    2.046411830913669
blood samples for histamine were withdrawn 5 min prior 3 and 5 min after each drug administration ( thiopentone , relaxants ) .    2.9569510688215943
plasma histamine was measured by radioimmunoassay ( ria ) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 pg / ml .    3.4698707507995934
additionally , serum tryptase was measured by ria at baseline ( - 10 and - 1 min ) and 15 and 60 min after the relaxant administration .    3.579301473492581
levels for histamine > 1000 pg / ml and for tryptase > 2 µg / ml were considered significant .    3.2023078957563533
cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented .    2.846771306207904
results : ten patients showed a positive prick - test reaction .    3.5479882315117557
only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs ( 4 UNK , 1 erythema ) of histamine release were observed .    3.05572848941486
there were no cutaneous signs of histamine release correlating with cardiovascular changes .    2.617854988059235
analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups .    4.054942412660067
only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level ( UNK pg / ml ) measured 5 min after 5xed95 cisatracurium .    3.5798277194724504
all measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits .    3.435904170127212
discussion : in this study , with the particular time course of drug administration , neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels .    3.443401093247736
only after 5xed95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min .    2.9077587423933364
in several studies increased histamine levels have been described , but without clinical manifestations .    3.3258722824583953
it is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells .    2.9180297555525962
the cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone .    4.286539256146228
the tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release .    4.028422065510201
no relationship between the positive results in the prick test and the incidence of cutaneous reactions and / or histamine release for drugs used in the induction of anaesthesia was observed .    4.3465701578599525
whether cisatracurium has a potential for immunologic release is unknown .    3.1274984243370083
we report on a psychosis caused by application of a transdermal scopolamine patch for over 15 days .    2.8210651211398017
in the literature there is no mention of a case in which scopolamine had such an influence nor are any cases reported in which paranoid - UNK symptoms UNK 11 days after removing the patch .    3.39464608887927
bone and joint tuberculosis , as all other types of tuberculosis is generally treated with UNK combination chemotherapy .    3.3625713697947064
this has to be continued for a minimum of six months , or nine months in case of extensive spreading .    3.9756382981892897
a two - to three - month initial phase with four or five different drugs ( h , r , z , and additionally e and / or s ) is followed by a four - to six - month therapy with h and r alone , provided the pathogen is fully susceptible to a standard regimen .    3.275058531219599
the main side effects are hepatotoxic or allergic reactions .    3.1516389413967585
a frequent contra - indication is existing , often toxicity - induced , liver damage .    2.912972085864419
the main local complications requiring surgery are spinal instability or neurologic deficiencies .    2.8979450649466605
this report concerns the case of a patient who had suffered a massive pulmonary embolus and for whom , despite immediately administered thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa it became necessary to initiate reanimation procedures .    3.0799555013282887
the patient was subsequently admitted to our cardiac surgery clinic for the purpose of operative intervention .    3.5815538964248606
after UNK coupling on the heart - lung machine , right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained .    2.807273979215175
during the course of a 3 - hour period of extracorporal circulation , the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels .    3.4915192826311596
correspondingly , right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined .    3.2669188514210035
as a consequence of this development , and after UNK the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk , it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy .    3.530728333709294
this procedure allowed , on the one hand , the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart - lung machine .    3.3669532213393634
on the other , due to the UNK of the degree of surgical intervention , the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be UNK .    3.995198061763669
after an uneventful course , the patient was able to be transferred on the second postoperative day with normal pulmonary pressure values .    3.7877362649616884

septic abortion remains one of the most serious threats to the health and life of women throughout the world .    3.4884134620117915
morbidity and mortality are infrequent in countries where induced abortion is legal and medically well organized , but widespread in many developing countries where it is either UNK or UNK .    2.8562312078965078
we observed two patients with stone formation in the renal pelvis two and five years after pyeloplasty .    3.5227767708665447
in both cases there was no obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction detectable .    3.1649590617215053
we consider the use of UNK ( UNK ) for the pelvis suture as reason for the stone formation .    4.02305979885357
for stone removal we favourite an endoscopic procedure , in which a removal of UNK of the suture is even possible as the verification of the pyeloureteral junction .    3.8707060077252655
aim of the study : the aim was to determine the efficiency of a secure control of ventilation in emergency medicine by using capnometry .    3.580570973544088
the advent of the excimer laser has brought about the potential for improved vision in many individuals with myopia and astigmatism .    2.848576400479891
however , photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy ( park ) remains a matter of controversy .    2.3858069779358435
the purpose of our study was to determine the UNK of UNK 20 / 20 excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy in the treatment of myopic astigmatism .    3.262721467026323
in germany , insect allergies cause about 10 - 40 death per year .    2.906666538308195
starting a specific immunotherapy ( sit ) and its maintenance may be UNK for the allergic patients .    3.8254064052898
performing a prospective study , we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of sit using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom ( clinical degree ii - iv ) .    3.0190628086337172
indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria : a ) clinical symptoms , b ) in - vivo - and in - vitro testing , c ) risk of re - UNK .    3.962277558613299
sit was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol .    3.2573918652007086
at the end of the induction phase all patients tolerated the maintenance dose of 100 µg of yellow jacket venom without complications even though all showed local side effects ( threshold doses 0 . 01 - 10 µg , median value 0 . 2 µg ) .    3.1645610464351446
40 % of all patients showed subjective side effects ( median value of threshold dose 30 µg , range 0 . 2 - 60 µg ) and 30 % showed objective side effects ( median value of threshold dose 55 µg , range 20 - 80 µg ) ; however , all side effects were clinically mild .    3.3454098392390454
our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for sit is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation .    2.9722778061629413
however , using a purified aqueous yellow jacket preparation did not result in reduction of side effects .    2.751837350685711
a 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with cyclosporin a .    3.793043744728877
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy , he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg , which histologically showed kaposi ' s sarcoma .    3.272282847842697
after stopping the cyclosporin a and intralesional therapy with interferon alpha , no regression of the kaposi sarcoma could be seen .    3.088274955376868
the characteristics of kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence , risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the aids - related kaposi sarcoma will be described .    3.3944433872921547
the development of kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described .    3.128289243674472
this analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for stage ii and iii rectal cancer .    3.128046192428135
we reviewed 112 patients treated with radiotherapy ( 44 patients ) and radiochemotherapy ( 68 patients ) after potentially curative ( r0 ) surgery for rectal cancer ( uicc stages ii and iii ) , between 1983 and 1994 at the university clinic of würzburg .    3.337132268652029
median radiation dose was 56 gy ( range : 45 to 66 gy ) .    3.1337892706486836
chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) ( 420 mg / m2 / d ) and leucovorin ( 200 mg / m2 / d ) .    3.0900099322030123
median follow - up was 37 months .    3.8051170422208878
the overall survival was 84 % for patients with uicc stage ii and 45 % for patients with uicc stage iii disease ( p = 0 . 0045 ) .    3.1721116753500533
there were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5 - year survival ( 63 % after radiochemotherapy vs 53 % after radiotherapy , p = 0 . 16 ) , relapse - free survival ( 52 % vs 50 % ) and locoregional control ( 69 % vs 67 % ) .    3.4445424025860163
uicc stage iii disease was associated with high failure rates ( 40 % pelvic recurrences and 53 % distant metastases ) .    3.5583499213234653
there was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with stage iii disease ( 49 % 5 - year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66 % after radiotherapy , p = 0 . 047 ) .    3.382075637284707
in a multivariate analysis , the addition of chemotherapy , lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival .    3.177551409749643
prognosis of patients with uicc stage iii rectal cancer remains poor after " standard " surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment ( pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5 - fu and leucovorin ) .    3.1733556008880384
major efforts should be made in order to improve prognosis for these patients , including optimization of surgical treatment and systemic treatment .    4.4480434870235745
more effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials .    3.2452234988476296
UNK warhol underwent UNK in 1957 because of a nasal skin lesion , which is best diagnosed as a rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical literature .    3.9810946217641607
throughout his creative life , the UNK worked on different aspects of plastic surgery especially in the nasal area .    4.2460142850607285
as one of the founders of UNK - art , warhol left essential marks on the modern society and influenced our standards of aesthetic shapes .    3.225976655798685
objective : the clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is not reliably reflected by laboratory measures .    2.7947044674147388
proteolytic enzymes involved in the cascade of joint destruction are potentially useful parameters to monitor the extent of joint inflammation in ra .    3.7269278476477976
this study compares the validity of two classes of proteolytic enzymes , matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) and lysosomal cysteine UNK ( cathepsin b , h , and l ) as well as their respective inhibitors to serve as parameters of ra disease activity .    2.832954835341038

invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old .    3.472021128077498
this article UNK this period , written by an r & d UNK , deals with four parts : first the situation before 1965 is UNK upon .    2.9211272035823304
for the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of prof . dr . k . bachmann and to the facility , which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed .    3.6490277148692774
k . bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965 , which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self - evident use today .    3.4905107232091375
the first clinical application of high resolution image UNK with the input UNK produced from UNK UNK UNK in UNK appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility .    4.232580254143254
the fourth part of the article UNK the status of today and , considering the new methods using mri , ebct as well as ct , it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium - term future .    3.5089680529362837
proton pump inhibitors ( omeprazole , UNK , and UNK ) have UNK the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention .    4.532056010368128
these substances inhibit the h + / k + - UNK in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of h2 - receptor - antagonists .    3.334465070733336
the first proton pump inhibitor , omeprazole , has been introduced ten years ago .    3.1999106661355903
since then , sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated .    3.5964013215606667
omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older .    3.493508547554978
a new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients .    2.8353214914530067
the main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies .    3.2744447945800967
in the treatment of helicobacter pylori - infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics .    3.2268152293332957
the recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0 , 7 - 1 , 4 mg / kg bodyweight and day .    3.766715482684579
healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy .    3.3789293243382623
after remission , doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy .    3.081749881502446
side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses .    4.27086427513249
possibly interactions with other medications , i . e .    3.093096238750097
antiepileptic drugs , may occur .    3.533059743505608
a long - term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric UNK .    3.349319806409803
nosocomial urinary tract infections ( uti ) are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy .    3.1041032220765814
the resection itself , postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections .    3.3242352961417585
in this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications .    3.1418658718199217
in 78 patients we observed in 42 cases ( 53 , 8 % ) a bacterial prostatitis .    3.732301684275596
in 14 patients ( 17 , 9 % ) we found nosocomial uti ' s and in 12 patients ( 15 , 4 % ) inflammatory complications .    4.21475506348939
the incidence of postoperative uti ' s increase significantly in patients with positive prostate - cultures .    3.312512681908329
on the other hand we only found corresponding prostate - and postoperative urine - cultures in less than 50 % .    3.2542353527546264
the presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative uti ' s in transurethral prostatectomy .    2.9893459523661727
under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial uti ' s in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general .    3.7396374767267107
apnea , bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care .    3.0902608120603317
the prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment , however , are controversial .    3.6630778018524186
the universal aim , in order to prevent traumatization of the lung , is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible .    3.296168156365238
therefore drugs such as theophylline , aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal cpap have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit .    2.897499008602327
in these studies we developed a treatment algorithm .    3.548924815198404
in two clinically controlled studies performed UNK we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline .    2.861485270709409
as aminophylline has more side effects , sodium acetate theophylline is preferable .    3.3502580436925133
bradycardia , apnea and desaturation were registered from the print - out of the monitoring system ' s trend analysis and in a UNK study during steady - state conditions .    3.508483664802194
in a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration .    3.362397588681504
we demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline ; however , doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment .    3.568408309838127
in a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal cpap as the third level of treatment .    3.416323227581794
the rate of bradycardia , apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during cpap and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved .    2.931016014183201
the algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg / kg as bolus infusion over 20 min , followed by 3 mg / kg UNK as the first line of treatment .    3.3189042039405763
only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice ( indication > = 4 bradycardias below 80 / min , 4 desaturations below 80 % or 2 apneas of > = 20 s over 2 h ) .    3.1621590536304804
after 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe > = 3 apneas , 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period .    2.814211220299297
nasal cpap was introduced as the third line of treatment .    3.3576139854591616
with this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4 . 9 to 3 . 4 days ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    3.0908212473408496
an evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi - institutional studies is indicated .    3.1015915478734133
background : associations between back pain , the quality of sleep and the quality of UNK have not yet been investigated systematically .    3.7579771209754056
methods : at check - out we asked UNK consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night .    2.8754235261427814
nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices , but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests .    3.127118975510779
sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 ( very good ) and 5 ( very bad ) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8 - year old mattresses of the hotel , but also with respect to social ( e . g .    3.7663830593070626
private vs . professional reason for the stay ) as well as personal ( e . g .    3.620509000113302
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints ) characteristics of the guests .    3.332279610147866
results : the three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep , but the difference to the " old " mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying UNK for professional reasons , or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances .    3.061728264544587
conclusion : at least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems , the association between sleep quality and quality of the UNK is significant .    4.003088532682264
body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in - patient and out - patient settings , individually or in groups , alone or combined with other methods .    3.167108046062281
these methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced , who are restricted in their emotions , or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character .    3.4633925273508375
short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays , reference is made to other procedures .    3.298465665719033
the connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter UNK and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has UNK consequences are mentioned as active factors .    3.410174077414519
in later development , the body and certain parts of the body acquire a UNK meaning too , which is important for the therapy .    4.060628970441475
the relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed .    2.905285429418997
approaches to empirical research are pointed out .    3.049801899587897
paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer .    3.658682111063952
supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism , specific UNK antibodies have sometimes been detected .    3.460953780035332
the current possibilities for treatment are limited .    3.334998657027369
a female patient , aged 57 , suffering from a breast cancer , developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks .    3.4368702134764244
it is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy .    2.9130762624526167
although the patient was still bound to a UNK , discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by UNK .    3.681329886402725
a recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred 2 months later but again showed a good remission .    3.2454592533788493
the outcome in 163 patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution 5 years ago is investigated .    3.439629470284808
some 142 patients underwent operative aneurysm repair ; 21 ( 13 % ) were excluded from operation .    3.2544504017077354
in 108 ( 66 % ) an elective procedure was performed , an emergency operation for rupture 34 times ( 21 % ) .    3.276198069933338
in 16 % of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted .    3.4063463489741466
for further analysis the patients were split in three groups : elective group 1 , symptomatic group 2 , ruptured group 3 .    3.917801679065731
significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter , distribution of gender ( 128 m , 14 f ) , renal artery involvement , or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking , hyperlipidemia , renal insufficiency , and the presence of multiple risk factors .    3.531980816317007
group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2 ; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups .    3.569761839653326
sixty - four percent of patients had no , 11 % had more than one complication .    3.6414735802818745
mortality was 0 in groups 1 and 2 , but 35 . 3 % in group 3 .    3.5505869604039666
the most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia ( 13 . 9 % ) followed by cardiac complications ( 4 . 6 % ) , and renal insufficiency ( 3 . 7 % ) .    3.8163875085261734
in group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence ( 23 . 5 % ) , followed by renal insufficiency ( 21 % ) and pneumonia ( 17 . 6 % ) .    3.5448420452756584
no patient of the UNK group suffered an aneurysm rupture ; aneurysm diameters , except one , did not increase during the follow - up period .    3.4362749432910764
of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died ; in no case was death related to the operative procedure .    3.113402270661728
no important complications were observed during the follow - up of 37 . 2 + / - 17 . 9 months .    3.962853968495644
furthermore , the results are compared with those of the literature .    3.473074942021591
based on their observations the authors conclude that this retrospective quality check was rather UNK and involved giving partly incomplete data for lack of a prospective evaluation .    3.1355255348610447
nevertheless , the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory .    3.945194476813949
we report on a 32 - year - old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) , who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract .    2.567570081513961
treatment with fluconazole , 200 mg / day , was introduced .    2.9984268736966584
after oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg / day was given for 1 month .    3.1310286703850743
however , fungal infection still persisted .    3.03787238114601
the antifungal activity of fluconazole , itraconazole and ketoconazole against candida albicans was evaluated by means of the UNK test by determining the 90 % inhibitory concentrations of each drugs .    3.573762582412694
a high minimal inhibitory concentration ( mic ) was detected for fluconazole ( 50 µg / ml ) revealing fluconazole resistance .    2.9460134411736836
the susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline ( mic 0 . 125 µg / ml ) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered ( mic 0 . 25 µg / ml ) .    2.7522589850746355
plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered .    4.026317186095233
in hiv patients the gastrointestinal absorption of azole derivatives is often reduced .    3.0332221074851744
therefore , the clinical resistance of candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in hiv patients .    3.29563329044649
patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance .    3.4607637003202156
besides this , recurrent lymph node metastases are often UNK to neighboring vessels .    3.4415498813873264
mri and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures .    3.250394813512316
vessel - invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone .    3.4703353189449158
if there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins , the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft .    2.8069887631204917
soft tissue coverage is of major importance , particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue .    3.187221791876594
to achieve this goal , surgical oncologists , vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together .    2.8817670544203366
today , amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel - invasive soft tissue tumors .    2.9508165344841295
the study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high - frequency jet ventilation ( UNK ) is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency .    3.667103830242652
surgery on the lacrimal system in UNK children was performed at the UNK university eye hospital from 1987 to 1992 .    3.8549253430730976
the dermatology clinic in krefeld has treated a wide range of patients since its founding in UNK .    3.1804374600957694
background : dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha - 1 - adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the UNK effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way .    2.817734630286147
the aim of this study was to determine for which indications for UNK pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is UNK and the practical .    2.9770247381052193
the quality assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation .    3.385078077067119
this presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both quality assurance and quality management into the field of medical rehabilitation .    3.187237709820752
the consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized .    2.697693739581972
the special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated .    3.9039744878692373
in addition , the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined .    3.1240212583126947
this field will inevitably have to UNK concepts of time and resource optimization .    3.517345269447922
for many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient .    3.291351767083995
most of the published systems have been created by a panel of experts , giving to each dysfunction a number of points , usually 1 to 4 , according to the severity .    3.7672329042426402
only 2 systems are different : the mods of UNK et al .    2.8152469697069678
and the logistic organ dysfunction lod system of le UNK et al . , both published recently ( 1995 and 1996 ) .    2.9875337665637116
they differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review ( UNK ) or from a logistic regression ( lod ) , and secondly , because neither takes into account the therapy .    3.502596997633191
besides , the lod system , when used on the 1st icu day , has statistical qualities which are very promising .    3.1267184457779713
the lod system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an european multicenter study .    3.0360085843028077
the UNK between the growth of tumors and the expression of the UNK bcl - 2 could be shown in epithelial tumors .    4.31791259000947
a bcl - 2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis .    3.648783263044316
the potential meaning of bcl - 2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown .    2.619201965235366
the fact , that the heterogenous group of UNK is not sufficiently characterized at present , suggested to investigate the bcl - 2 expression in osteosarcoma .    3.898048116248248
thus , immunohistochemistry was used to analyze 47 specimens of different osteosarcomas of 36 patients .    3.3693303627935647
sixteen cases ( 46 % ) showed a strong expression of bcl - 2 and 13 cases ( 35 % ) were moderately positiv for bcl - 2 .    3.599366214910407
seven cases ( 19 % ) were negative for bcl - 2 .    3.8943418566528565
the heterogenous , negative up to strong expression of bcl - 2 yield clues , that the bcl - 2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics .    3.1984993262442347
additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the UNK antibody mib 1 , directed against the ki - 67 UNK .    3.323403923008471
the data of bcl - 2 expression and cellular proliferationrate lead to a classification correlating with the histological classification .    3.3125173440779534
to verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether bcl - 2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma , further investigations will be needed .    3.7057420523979077
during a period of two weeks in hot dry UNK 3 patients presented in our pediatric outpatient clinic after a bath in a small UNK .    3.116071335973827
they had an extremely itching , elevated exanthema mainly on their legs .    2.992210782756139
the single UNK had a diameter of about 1 - 3 cm .    3.4959195143873636
there were no signs of infection or fever .    3.0888013613116403
intussusception of the appendix UNK in adults is an uncommon event .    3.9719945100415
the combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an UNK appendix is extremely rare .    2.9011495084246004
clinical symptoms are nonspecific ; in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration .    3.376767167050007
with the radiologic and endoscopic presentation of a polypoid lesion of the UNK , a neoplasm is often considered .    4.282898993782666
endoscopic appendectomy or UNK by UNK have been described .    3.955588381764501
there are some case reports about excessive heat production in the absorbent canister when sevoflurane or enflurane are UNK into a circle containing dried soda lime .    2.757480945494063
this observation was often made in the dräger iso 8 circle system with the gas inlet UNK of the soda lime canister with the gas - flow from bottom to top .    3.399605384407057
abstract : mr - imaging of the spinal column using turbo - spin - echo - sequences ( UNK ) often shows flow - UNK structures resembling UNK vessels .    3.3981783014795024
due to misinterpretation of those phenomenons invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed to diagnose an arteriovenous malformation ( UNK , spinal angiography ) .    3.6253044524817395
purpose : to compare the effectiveness of spiral ct versus conventional ct in the preoperative assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies .    3.320285498434948
more than 150 years ago , UNK and mandibular resections as well as UNK were already performed by leading surgeons .    3.959686377645844
the block principle we are now following dates back to UNK , who also established the principle of cervical lymph node dissection .    3.6669147158216577
ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery , rendering radical surgical interventions possible without UNK patients .    3.045343391803172
the development of facial reconstructive surgery UNK in stages , in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps .    3.8273038623701776
the change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via UNK skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer .    3.1799600487090136
free bone grafting , inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting , has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites .    3.432203123734855
although the five - year - survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years , distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded .    3.613731876406525
this is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques .    3.081458609201576
the dösak has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery .    2.847863665056472
surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections .    2.832144717971737
for this reason , midfacial UNK offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors , especially from an aesthetic point of view .    2.7764668038336597
tumors situated deep behind the UNK at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a UNK , UNK , or UNK approach with minimal morbidity .    3.6313422442528642
concerning the concept of neck dissection , radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure .    3.493701961943131
actual UNK concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in " no - neck " or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification .    3.202128862347843
laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years .    3.2376696878490976
due to its physical properties , the co2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and UNK tissue .    3.0979716155682073
the high absorption of its wavelength in water ( = UNK nm ) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue .    3.02868890754155
shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects , such as UNK and coagulation .    3.87850186841485
this effect can be UNK with the silktouch scanner , since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating UNK .    3.295010865667039
this enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions .    3.0290499224420535
particularly well - suited for treatment hypertrophic scars , post - acne scarring , perioral and periorbital UNK , UNK and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris .    3.3244067769733734
cosmetically favorable UNK of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment .    4.050727076761215
periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the co2 laser and the silktouch scanner .    3.603555425060997
acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved .    3.083212604211963
analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care .    3.856073585144423
therefore , there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed .    3.354727384221157
the first hours after the accident are decisive , because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later .    3.685914145511194
besides the fate of the individual patient , the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care , long lasting rehabilitation , as well as post rehabilitative care .    3.794636869507486
chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons , UNK in hippocampus , by which the degree of damage differs in various species .    3.3112218546198435
UNK has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration , disturbed UNK - back reaction , and UNK of glucocorticoids .    3.6053476488171294
the aim of this study was to investigate if the signal transmission via glucocorticoid receptors ( gr ) in the brain of male wistar rats of two age groups ( 5 - 6 and 17 - 24 months , respectively ) is changed in aging and which cytoplasmic factors / UNK participate in this process .    3.155625125790225
introduction : the treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge , because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered .    3.2483311888945914
patients and methods : the data of 52 patients , who were treated between 1994 and 1998 , were analyzed .    3.1941648748571634
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 % .    3.3599719619669384
amputation was required in 4 patients .    3.999227801466584
the overall success rate was 92 % .    2.496717547355696
complications occurred in 18 patients .    2.8597328083968727
conclusions : using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area .    3.994010192551727
the modern armamentarium of plastic surgery offers the possible different treatment modalities .    3.148935125160957
the conventional multichannel electroencephalogram is quite UNK for long - term monitoring in the operating theatre or intensive care unit .    3.1988881826871562
recording of the eeg would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient .    3.543511841097743
aiming at reduction of channels , leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content .    3.6143290236363446
apc resistance was first discovered in 1993 .    3.7137169908216143
it is the most frequent cause of UNK in europe and north america .    3.4618046793296378
in more than 90 % of cases , the underlying cause of apc resistance is a single point mutation in the factor v gene .    3.104325994861368
heterozygous patients have a between five - and ten - fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis , while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50 - and 100 - fold .    3.5880646466143484
where there is a previous history of thrombosis , a careful investigation of the coagulation system , in particular a determination of the apc ratio , is recommended prior to surgery .    4.062906842389755
in patients with apc resistance , a body - weight - specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended .    3.3572758744421525
heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present , while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time .    2.7716509900705275
primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications .    3.470996687591552
pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to staphylococcus aureus .    3.2646869489880217
the disease is found more often in males .    3.0837633576719474
furthermore , cases of pyomyositis are rare in non - tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it .    3.470562302370136
if not diagnosed and treated properly , pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death .    3.224370632561608
although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified , some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known : ( trivial ) trauma or UNK exercise of the affected skeletal muscles , small potentially " septic " foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency , e . g . in diabetes mellitus , intravenous drug UNK or individuals suffering from hiv .    3.264064924819203
three cases of " non - tropical " pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors , taking forensic aspects , histomorphologic findings and the problems of post - mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration .    3.4272540296823797
aim of the study : the etiology of persistent UNK during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated .    2.947121096301909
based upon recent data from the " munich interdisciplinary research and intervention program ( UNK ) " , this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models .    3.4194719277317835
in addition , novel approaches of intervention shall be presented .    2.6370986263559506
because tumour cell invasion is a three - dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells , tumour invasion models should include UNK of both compartments in a UNK defined organisation .    3.915500156245179
aims : evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane ( bm ) formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3d co - culture system ( collagen type i / fibroblast - containing matrix ) .    2.984138858974345
material and methods : oscc cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type i matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro - / myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis ) .    2.8005956622603385
evaluation of invasion was done by conventional h & e staining after paraffin embedding ; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins ( UNK 116 ) , involucrin ( UNK ) , vimentin ( UNK ) , collagen type iv ( UNK ) , laminin ( 1 - chain , UNK ) , and ki - 67 ( mib1 ) ; and electron microscopy followed .    3.955793847257644
results : the oscc cell lines pe / ca - UNK , pe / ca - UNK , pe / ca - UNK were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the UNK oscc cell coat and UNK expression of cytokeratin and involucrin .    2.6888057672264507
there was no evidence for bm , either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy , although oscc are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type iv and laminin in the 2d cell culture .    2.7493881320366973
there were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts .    2.8877953278766246
conclusions : carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro - / myofibroblasts during UNK invasion .    3.0484888483203907
the absence of a bm does not , per se , imply an invasive tumour growth .    2.922238109669699
moreover , stratification and UNK differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural bm .    2.945838473846644
interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing .    3.6302555899145212
limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability .    3.3646986574559863
although larger movements still promote callus formation , the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered .    3.4868803938650537
fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large .    3.3593498776026944
a combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non - union .    3.8501062022325168
therefore , having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach , one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis .    3.4619931510191506
dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap , stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process .    3.2011764340520963
external mechanical stimulation , however , has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load - bearing patients .    3.7194077060028468
in recent years , however , new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex UNK .    3.383466872550934
this article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on UNK - operated and voltage - operated transmembrane ion channels , g - protein - coupled receptors , transmitter uptake , and the no - cgmp system in neurons .    3.0427687287106684
with regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception , analgesia , anaesthesia , and UNK , the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are UNK .    3.524973519612796
in contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors , there is now considerable evidence that nmda antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the UNK , analgesic , anaesthetic , and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine .    3.5090671801763147
moreover , the involvement of non - nmda glutamate receptors , UNK and nicotinic cholinergic transmission , interactions with 5 - ht receptors , and l - type ca2 + channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties .    3.193413471495672
there is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ent specialists .    3.2701788072083082
so far , a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established .    3.4924169433809946
therefore , in the ent departments of the hospitals of mannheim , UNK , and tübingen , studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between february 1999 and may 1999 .    3.3617885958050526
instruments were UNK either with an aldehyde or alcohol ( ethanol 80 % ) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures .    3.509041834875275
as discussed in the article , disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde .    3.193592478122441
therefore , it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels .    2.7651140114867787
white piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals , caused by the widespread UNK fungi .    3.8895731304411347
the infection is characterized clinically by whitish , soft and easily UNK coating of the hair shafts ; however , the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points .    3.188471451201828
while all body hair may be affected , the pubic hair is most frequently affected .    3.1088232439237644
this paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34 - year - old central european man .    3.1046941473161986
in all , 22 cases have been described world - wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years .    3.301505132367966
only 2 men , aged 42 and 53 years , do not fall in this range .    2.8968406086983087
recently , a major african study disclosed this disease in women for the first time .    2.9108696731893473
in moderate UNK , however , this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men .    3.8033412864158826
in open fractures the rate of infected non - union defects has in recent years decreased due to the increased primary application of external fixation .    4.121512234018263
in spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques .    2.760456055247304
in the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied .    3.106697941226753
this includes radical excision of infected UNK bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue , provides mechanical stability in the non - union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic , target - specific and temporary well - defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation .    3.845273242638239
the incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material .    3.075813522216709
a promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction ; therefore special attention is given to UNK ' s ring fixation system .    3.2692452478439704
unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or UNK free flap transfer , which seems to be superior to other methods .    3.4977992464079417
aim of the study : using phantom studies , a dedicated low - field mr system with 0 . 2 t and a whole - body mr - scanner with 1 . 0 t were compared .    3.3361887482646413
many different mechanisms contribute to the etiopathogenesis of the so - called diabetic foot syndrome .    3.3888689042140556
among chronic complications , the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization .    3.1384677398566345
the relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects .    2.7852539523693545
in most cases , a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer .    3.0497133148865014
in this article , an overview of the different causes , clinical manifestations , and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed .    3.204241882354278
lung resection offers the best prospect of long - term survival in patients with UNK pulmonary neoplasia .    3.793909533013807
in view of the dismal prognosis of UNK bronchial cancer , surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function .    3.5196250462265692
the origins of UNK morbidity and mortality are multifactorial .    3.4548012962416146
thus , no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications .    2.8050279270663165
criteria of functional operability should be based on percent of predicted value , so that patient ' s age , sex , and height will be taken into consideration .    3.2872391341381406
exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously .    3.2702460241839044
the high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake ( vo2max ) in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established .    3.251730640941742
the calculation of predicted postoperative lung function ( ppo ) is of importance .    3.2143632538444002
the postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second ( fev1 - ppo ) , the transfer factor ( tl , co - ppo ) , and vo2max - ppo can be predicted by using the same formula .    3.3120111548820863
patients with nearly normal lung function ( fev1 , tl , co > 75 % predicted ) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures .    2.9267766128876582
patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable , whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics .    3.0809160855631923
vo2max < 10 ml / kg / min or < 40 % predicted are UNK for surgery .    3.162941327692107
if vo2max is > 20 ml / kg / min or > 75 % predicted , functional operability without limitation is given .    2.813630410926238
for those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains , fev1 - ppo , tl , co - ppo , and vo2max - ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans .    2.837615174659323
patients with either fev1 - ppo and tl , co - ppo < 30 % predicted or vo2max - ppo < 8 ml / kg / min or < 35 % predicted are deemed inoperable .    2.6130889810632825
the treatment of acute of achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years .    2.9869099622685
decisive for this development was the application of mri and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons .    3.839727560176709
the question of UNK morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively .    3.023693333673037
these advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols .    3.0180554934209067
the decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment .    3.682505651614812
of the hannover medical school could show no statistical differences comparing functional non - operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy UNK ( UNK / UNK ) .    3.3328896429682473
the crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the UNK measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion ( 20 ° ) .    3.747791440010167
with complete adaptation of the tendons ' ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non - operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome .    3.042595506737111
both , the operative and non - operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of UNK ( 1 - 2 % ) .    3.9451832468810943
meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated achilles ' tendons .    2.926058786771306
there seems to be a trend towards non - operative functional treatment in cases of UNK UNK findings , or to minimal invasive surgical techniques .    3.947678622267006
based on a case report , we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with sleep - apnea - syndrome ( sas ) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period .    3.7467259532368677
a 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34 , 22 kg / m2 and receiving continuous - positive - airway - pressure - ( cpap ) therapy for known sas was scheduled for elective plastic surgery .    3.1138228705313336
after induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic , UNK and developed hypotension and bradycardia .    3.7508160020362022
with the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic UNK after immediate awakening .    3.8076815458964126
the following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient , still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction , confirmed the difficult anatomical structures .    2.919394487893386
the subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful .    3.366877301023239
the patient received cpap therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the intensive care unit .    2.968000876200793
he made an uneventful recovery .    3.2866512589505814
he was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation , where possible , in the case of further anesthetic intervention .    3.3075369598149242
sas has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors ( obesity , male sex , history of intense snoring , impaired daytime performance , UNK daytime UNK ) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered .    3.3273307686268363
elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary .    3.5794702249604438
patients with sas should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension , cardiac dysrhythmia or cor UNK .    2.8302026052826523
it is most important to avoid sedative premedication , to initiate cpap therapy preoperatively , to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period .    3.042699804079117
planned fiberoptic intubation , preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway , is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia .    3.6974446158475454
postoperatively , patients are at high risk from respiratory depression , even in the awake state .    3.798268465628665
postoperative opioid analgesia , no matter what route , should only be given under close monitoring .    3.3291828969877884
independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week , suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost rem - sleep , due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days .    4.043268454515029
life style measures ( weight reduction and control , reduction of total fat calories to < 30 % of total calories , modification of fat intake to increased UNK UNK fat , increased intake of dietary fibers , increased physical activity , controlled stress relaxation ) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease .    3.354092570979228
for transformation to daily life both patient and doctor need motivation , information , UNK , and realistic UNK .    3.663169446508282
for realization the 10 rules of medical information should be followed .    3.4543852306530916
the patient must be informed that the " new lifestyle " is not UNK but means a new quality of life .    2.788993854417005
with respect to the most important metabolic syndrome with UNK due to insulin resistance , weight reduction is the most important measure for preventing complications of atherosclerosis .    3.9513138324361754
the patient should use a diary for weight control and blood pressure UNK .    3.115222624254443
iol implantation in childhood is still controversial .    3.6304691717671354
background : increases in serum calcium are often detected by chance .    3.019569416693711
they warrant a prompt diagnostic work - up to identify the underlying cause .    3.7265009153788284
in the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis , with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis .    3.850048987027285
within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative apache ii score of 9 .    3.5874919438859667
the indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms .    2.6354275012560633
thirty - six patients were found to have infected necrosis , while 28 patients had sterile necrosis .    3.0824505171008707
there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre - and postoperative parameters .    2.4870116032412057
the surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed UNK with UNK drains .    3.1374566886042907
this technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6 . 2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 % , demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely .    3.510259906240396
the incidence of postoperative myocardial infarction ( mi ) is proportional to the incidence of myocardial ischaemic episodes .    3.0535343268793635
therefore , the prevention of such episodes is of great clinical importance .    3.455133130954731
the absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery ( tur - p ) .    2.9181682186379234
various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy .    3.4775104217719184
the volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy .    3.5673681408664275
easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding ( haematocrit [ hct ] ) , or are UNK with by physiological counter - regulatory actions ( serum sodium [ na ] concentration ) .    2.96055889187315
in 1986 UNK et al .    2.7221844902523227
suggested adding 2 % ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol - test appliance .    3.1474314688862406
in a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing tur - p under spinal anaesthesia , expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid ( 2 % ethanol in UNK , UNK , bad homburg ) were monitored .    3.407882246009439
gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified UNK anaesthetic gas monitor ( normac , datex , UNK ) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use .    3.4039568543819225
in addition , at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol , UNK alcohol ( alcotest 7110 , UNK ; UNK , lübeck ) , haematocrit , serum na concentration , and blood gases .    3.0489287015482986
sixty - eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients .    3.2730627628680375
as shown in other studies , serum na ( r2 = 0 . 68 ) and hct ( r2 = 0 . 39 ) correlated poorly with the irrigation fluid as determined by serum alcohol levels .    3.209603714343329
in contrast , the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 ( r2 = 0 . 93 ) and normac devices ( r2 = 0 . 85 ) were closely related .    3.0104726503315784
continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations , and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during tur - p .    3.0098632293791283
between 1986 and 1996 , 21 patients had a UNK arthrodesis .    3.7177874572773133
external stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus , internal screw fixation was used in four patients .    4.1098559026134165
there were eight complications in seven patients , one patient had a below the knee amputation .    3.6021035930390153
the leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was UNK in four cases with callus distraction using an ilisarov ring fixator .    3.722453231901108
follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months ( 12 - 86 UNK . ) .    3.5111259733082787
there were no infectious UNK during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed .    4.129662420931501
according to a modified kitaoka score , results were excellent and good in 12 of the UNK .    3.510756151100391
external stabilisation , especially the ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage .    3.927811410420754
intraoperative autotransfusion ( mat ) , preoperative autologous blood donation , and preoperative UNK haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures .    2.959101934039976
the controversial use of mat via cell UNK in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy .    3.4717976412098746
we investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the UNK red blood cells ( rbc ) , bacterial contamination , changes in coagulation parameters , and the presence of tumour cells .    4.460257219036555
orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types : granulomatous , lymphoid , and sclerosing .    3.619854885620676
between 1995 and 1998 , 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ent department of the university of saarland .    3.5790986765830652
histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six , lymphoid in three , and sclerosing in three patients .    3.230072129468881
in seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases UNK .    2.812563532124578
in one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated .    2.926224156147493
a number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph - node staging in lung cancer .    3.3762288304772907
the use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the tnm status and comparing the surgical results .    3.417343143278931
in order to evaluate the current status of lymph - node mapping and lymph - node dissection in germany , we performed a UNK survey involving 90 hospitals performing operations for lung cancer .    2.8254340371140407
responses were obtained from 61 ( 67 . 7 % ) hospitals .    4.1234133886773705
currently , the majority of the departments ( 43 % ) use the german staging system ( according to the deutsche gesellschaft für thorax - , herz - und UNK / UNK ) , 23 % lymph - node mapping according to UNK , and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes .    3.879316057464239
the number of resected lymph nodes is reported in 75 % of the departments , the quotient of involved / not involved lymph nodes in 33 % .    3.638459503445264
mediastinal lymph - node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments .    4.148349139826883
a systematic mediastinal " en - bloc " resection is accomplished in 41 % .    2.847773674117851
the results of this survey represent the current status of lymph - node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system .    3.060793971437475
in a 4 - year period two right - sided UNK occurred following a total of 39 UNK for lung cancer .    3.7598466804048076
in another case pneumonectomy was performed for left - sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital .    3.5077047630220433
empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with UNK - iodine solution and UNK / UNK .    3.669863339026707
three to seven UNK were required to UNK the pleural cavity .    3.875369071334883
after a median follow - up of 14 months all three patients are well and without any evidence of infection .    3.3174357727005788
UNK is suitable for definitive treatment of UNK empyema and is associated with excellent functional and cosmetic results .    3.672905668060282
injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem .    3.920093893228826
in the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described .    3.9078842423381084
the results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented .    3.293649656488129
decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach .    3.7508650019989442
positive results were achieved in the late phase in 84 . 22 % of patients with acute spinal and spinal cord injuries .    4.20740835645925
objectives : children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) or non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) show retarded growth .    2.6442576011595427
background : the fundus autofluorescence imaging technique has been modified allowing improved image resolution ( 768 x UNK pixel ) .    2.5969312692100304
we present results of fundus autofluorescence studies using this technique .    2.8453076450527504
certain intra - articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation .    2.8896528860148583
the known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint , limited dissection , and thorough irrigation .    3.219434487486538
the purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra - articular fractures of the knee .    2.5410483402257174
from may 1995 to november 1997 , 34 patients with intra - articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation .    3.147616818839884
we treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type i , ii and iii ( according to j . UNK classification ) , 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament ( intercondylar UNK ) type ii , iii and iv ( according to meyers , UNK and UNK classification ) , two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral UNK fractures of the femoral condyle , and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella .    3.6021841484348824
postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises .    3.0543405552811396
patients with avulsion fractures of the acl and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing , while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks .    3.6942528339695455
results : of the 11 tibial plateau fractures , 8 were anatomically reduced , and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm .    3.1928004376114245
no further dislocation of the fragment followed .    3.8585378986928878
all patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow - up .    2.8465914258858818
of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament , 19 were anatomically reduced .    3.0655042431045314
except in one patient , functional results were excellent ( UNK was 1 . 3 mm , average loss of flexion was 2 . 5 ° , loss of extension was 1 . 3 ° ) .    4.151826915892207
in two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle , reduction was anatomical .    3.4584883588171538
the fractures healed , the patients were free of pain and had full rom at the follow - up .    3.3064606170308553
the fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full rom of the knee .    3.4342539998532864
there was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications .    3.3269037354343602
conclusions : arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra - articular fractures of the knee .    2.8693307859722554
provided indications are good , results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy .    3.653488140666678
there is less postoperative morbidity , and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter .    3.2544205788238054
some technical hints are presented .    3.140685938691556
a healthy 38 - year - old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy .    3.2114364707521252
although standard cardiac life support ( cpr ) was instituted immediately after the event , it was not possible to re - establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min .    3.3318069468086504
systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1 . 5 million iu urokinase was performed as a final life - maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus ; 10 min later ( after 60 min of ongoing cpr ) the patient regained a stable circulation .    3.6298979260052895
she survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of cpr .    3.6835800266528853
in UNK patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection , its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging .    4.359429057224202
the same histopathological work - up was carried out in all cases .    3.2618130888085637
neither the type of operation nor the surgeon ' s experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected .    3.4424306616779874
the increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation , the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk .    3.6742186678005906
we found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases ( p = 0 . 02 ) and between an increase in uicc stage iii ( p = 0 . 005 ) and UNK tumors ( p = 0 . 000 ) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected .    3.5623222230837825
central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases .    4.001266398302063
with the institution of the protection against infection act , case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of UNK infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in germany for the first time .    2.7478567850652
case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease .    3.4138466924009
the case definitions , which were developed by the robert koch institute ( rki ) according to the protection against infection act , enable the local health departments to assess and UNK reported cases , deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the rki via the state health institutions . the quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved , as each reported case / infection will fulfil defined criteria , thereby enabling unclear cases / diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed .    2.963685130016937
endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues .    3.5347652531717797
furthermore , implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site , if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts , by guided bone regeneration , by distraction osteogenesis , by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion .    3.4899665511112667
those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary , if complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of UNK or to insert implant - supported devices .    3.671808323293557
a 58 - year - old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass , which was subsequently treated as an UNK .    3.2666779198541374
thereafter , the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas .    3.6873193899481413
further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor , considered to be an epidermoid cyst , which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed .    3.8065175228453136
histologically , cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm .    3.1229355618041765
later on , the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass .    3.26637669733196
as a result , an abdominal - perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a UNK were done .    3.5311698169375894
histologically , adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail - gut cyst .    3.01010732276549
one year following her operation , the patient is free from any complaints and relapses .    3.629178199703285
the tail - gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate UNK of the tail - gut during embryonal development .    3.372342432772592
a malignant transformation occurs in 10 % of the cases .    3.1490942941931945
in the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os UNK , a tail - gut cyst should be taken into consideration , the goal being its complete removal .    2.982256165045442
the german social law has required quality assurance ( qa ) procedures since 1989 .    2.637001127206238
the measures must be suitable to allow " comparing investigations " .    3.010629963975404
in 1992 the german society of anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine published recommendations for qa in anaesthesia : most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner , and thus , a list of 63 pitfalls , events , and complications ( pecs ) and five degrees of severity were defined .    3.2427798067199447
the goal of this study was to determine the frequency of pecs in anaesthesia and to correlate pecs with procedures and preoperative health status .    2.8618853621365514
using the diary method , the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed .    2.997598657944283
positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood .    2.9240535417278566
duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities .    2.993398895139695
a total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days .    2.960509861850137
the data were analyzed UNK ( using regression analyses ) and intraindividually ( using time series analyses ) .    2.8715245646760112
while positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter - and intraindividual perspective , there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective .    3.2011476664569605
theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed .    3.8832138483485927
purpose : regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or / and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced , deep - seated tumors .    3.2070910198433835
the purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non - invasive , three - dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia .    3.391742328748406
in order to reach this goal , the law regulates the essential UNK for the adequate collection of blood and blood UNK , as well for safe usage of blood products .    3.8048004671929188
moreover it UNK down rules for look - back procedures , UNK the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations , creates a legal basis for the advisory group ' UNK UNK ' , and UNK the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions .    3.5404531984098004
in the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries .    2.569884224684673
disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs .    2.837871822836175
accurate prevalence estimates are needed to serve as a basis for health care evaluations .    3.508385604670857
a review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain .    3.257238070599962
7 to 18 % are " frequently " , " often " , " daily " or " constantly " affected .    3.5819008406789967
75 % of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year .    3.642703385908224
80 to 90 % of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever .    3.637467372645085
gender specific differences are only present in severe , chronic forms which are more often experienced by women .    3.382421711418862
back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years .    3.219801678975797
the prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women .    2.9931438904053254
there are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article .    2.9967999056229684
back pain can be classified by location , temporal characteristics , pain intensity and pain history .    3.2106547094237086
currently , for none of these dimensions generally accepted , uniformly employed and validated definitions are available .    2.9712209273038446
in most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms .    3.4416449310734385
75 - 90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5 - 10 % of patients who are disabled .    4.097030307049983
as predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors .    3.2313558952860277
for a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable .    3.3287941827875165
if the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable .    3.662196110710089
after six months of UNK because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work .    3.5278543672792275
rarely back pain is present as a single symptom .    3.9318302564094583
in more than 80 % back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint .    4.006804641020392
it remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome .    3.3080037491730727
chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies .    3.492364094282003
dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine - supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain .    3.4496418244282667
consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine - supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine - UNK behaviour .    3.2980602654716904
in addition to various measures of pain therapy , physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro - physiotherapy , physical treatment ( UNK UNK ) , UNK and supportive behavioural training , medical rehabilitation therapy ( mrt ) ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain .    3.4462594301857035
mrt applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation .    2.9629737602589317
various objectives of mrt are outlined with special regard to the stages of mrt treatment , emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro - muscular system in the course of rehabilitation .    3.302174879120664
physicians are responsible for mrt diagnosis and control .    3.5427978843926593
taking into account the base disorder and the progress of therapy physiotherapists and the physicians in charge determine mrt objectives and treatment strategies .    2.9143363396957906
a 39 - year - old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after UNK sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) .    2.565130981663433
skin tests and cap specific .    3.3783344666443487
ige demonstrated an ige - mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds .    3.1704448231691824
when sunflower seeds were UNK alone , only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred .    3.1934666985059303
surprisingly , an oral challenge with asa was well tolerated .    3.065470191901846
the supplementary UNK of asa to the allergic reaction was done - dependent .    3.2738674446214677
the quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms .    3.2320216723847786
this surprising effect of asa may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens .    3.105326827479829
during the course of this reaction , UNK - UNK - protein was released .    4.002113186542286
axillary lymph node dissection for node sampling is one of the most important staging procedures when mammary carcinoma is treated surgically .    3.4139345346357928
periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability .    3.7003933399589277
various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures .    3.499663166161004
we treated 51 patients with 54 periprosthetic fractures between 1985 and 1995 .    2.9377100924282025
of these , 42 ( 78 % ) fractures were treated with a plate , eight ( 14 % ) , with a revision prosthesis , two ( 4 % ) , with retrograde nailing , and two ( 4 % ) , conservatively due to poor medical condition .    3.494771480748959
the choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis .    3.905739226563815
a total of 50 fractures healed primarily .    2.7898777475054946
complications included three cases of plate loosening , one further fracture , one deep infection , one broken bolt and one varus deformity .    3.161047091832391
four patients died in the postoperative period , an additional 19 were dead at the time of the evaluation .    3.434752956734382
fractures with a stable implant can be treated with plate fixation .    3.715824847854024
cases of a loose implant require revision .    3.363102510844641
distal fractures are stabilized with a plate or with a retrograde nail .    3.4453716021151464
a young patient who underwent renewed aortic valve replacement after already open UNK of the aortic valve and following valve replacement with enlargement of the ascending thoracic UNK by using a pericardium patch had taken place is reported .    3.7275661857651823
in the area of this enlargement by the pericardium patch , the development of an aneurysm was seen and was resected in the same setting without any difficulties .    3.5341579536275214
the particular items with special regard to the postoperative course are delineated in the following report .    3.7421536987576696
the situation of oncological surgery in germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in january 1998 to 1979 registered surgical clinics .    3.1446444676559953
a total of UNK responded and stated that they are involved in that field .    3.0161924232747017
the proportion of oncological surgery correlated to hospital size and is highest in university clinics .    3.109186590782935
colorectal surgery is 93 % and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery .    3.622763014227458
73 % of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery .    4.627229491165312
the proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high ( 45 % ) .    2.8946202935617857
many hospitals ( 54 . 6 % ) report neoadjuvant treatment regimens .    3.5539794551065955
together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to 85 . 2 % .    3.216065813176483
the diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the UNK is UNK .    4.376424981017305
however , the modern possibilities of network and UNK are not sufficiently used .    3.465854039828247
a second opinion is required predominantly in their own department or clinic , but not between centers .    3.3883403608819904
the surgeon ' s position concerning the speciality " surgical oncology " is UNK : only 35 . 3 % of the department UNK support this speciality - and over 90 % of the departments reject the structural independence of " surgical oncology " from " visceral surgery " .    3.1899125081825916
cryosurgery is a widely accepted modality for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas of the newborn .    3.9817330797004136
however , no studies clearly supporting its effectivity are available .    2.716810621039213
a considerable number of patients with cardiovascular diseases suffer from advanced heart failure .    2.7580220641276707
actuarial 6 - 12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50 - 75 % .    3.4081160680521205
since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine , azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment .    3.122350321139159
however , the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive UNK of patients for heart transplantation .    3.396470923984305
during the last few years promising new conservativ and alternativ surgical therapies have been developed .    2.595309390354634
the conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and UNK UNK .    3.2887755226657043
alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery , high risk valve surgery , mechanical assist devices , implantable cardioverter - defibrillators , partial left UNK , UNK and UNK - pacing .    3.45395759183348
they serve as bridge to transplantation or medium - and long - term alternatives to heart transplantation .    3.2036994432539876
the therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy .    3.432002941438954
this requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure .    3.296933109111396
motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash .    3.5327172851502335
in the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and UNK of UNK based crash test experiments and UNK .    3.138829987290203
in the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value .    3.3700489513632017
data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine , UNK disturbances , postural control , tmj - function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash .    2.951740484954828
the standardisation of technical and clinical set - ups is necessary to establish a well proven UNK model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction .    3.2245139455735488
without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost - nor time consuming and free of adverse effects .    3.279447109582412
within a prospective series of 28 patients ( 14 m / 14 f ) with a follow - up to six weeks we were lucky to describe UNK two different types of reaction to low energy ( v < 20 km / h ) rear end collision : type i with disturbances in complex movements only , type ii with overall restriction of movement .    3.235475201677601
control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients .    3.2063837346089157
recovery from whiplash within 6 weeks could be monitored .    3.2652544550964486
diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory .    3.28245910682058
to test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients ( three women and seven men , mean age 27 + / - 3 . 4 ) with somnambulism .    3.4876973381270484
their standard UNK and UNK nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex - and age - matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation .    3.5894379221653536
patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls , which was nonsignificant .    3.69090519776341
in magnetic resonance tomography , patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior .    3.8012610798527557
sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals , reduced arousal index , significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages ( nonsignificant ) .    2.8059399469029644
complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation , whereas sleepwalking did not increase .    2.904647281173428
the majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the american sleep disorder society .    3.071859245730735
complex behavior in sleep is UNK and UNK .    3.1036295036898447
its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals .    3.5425637586992047
sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep , which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking .    3.334304501067913
concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone .    3.8677125547400717
introduction : in order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5 - year recurrence and survival rates , we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques .    3.5662841439889164
patients and methods : the surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 ( department a : 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas ; department b : 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas ) .    3.009893554001971
results : the local recurrence rate achieved by department a was signicantly higher ( colon carcinoma : department a 25 % ; department b 10 % ; rectal carcinoma : department a 54 % ; department b 16 % ) .    2.7342711720147705
the 5 - year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department a , and 66 % in department b , the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 % , respectively .    2.9263899125366506
conclusion : the results indicate that carcinoma of the UNK should be operated on only at an institution that UNK with the standards required for surgery of colorectal carcinoma .    4.150550066915026
definition of the problem : ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health - care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges .    2.9448618864451555
the practice of ethics consultation , as performed at the freiburg university hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination .    3.654633126517481
the range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed .    2.902696421219953
a research program in clinical ethics is summarized that has been undertaken to pave the way for a specific and interdisciplinary analysis of needs ; from there on , the investigation aims at further developing clinical ethics support services .    2.9220842445031137
suggestions for criteria of competence for ethics UNK are formulated on the basis of both the author ' s and international work .    3.802779845508988
finally , the issues of structural conditions for establishing clinical ethics in the german - speaking world are raised and the long - term prospect of ethics consultation as an instrument for learning and teaching ethics in the health - care system is highlighted .    3.1511208628765925
objectives bridging of an extensive bone defect with a long stem revision prosthesis anchored in the diaphysis to restore a pain free function of the limb .    3.5289362612331967
a total of 205 patients suffering from stage i and stage ii melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress , social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support .    3.403306220280731
additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59 % of the patients , and interviews with a psychotherapist , by 20 % .    3.378462962777311
patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist .    3.0322232115292245
patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support .    2.9044326329926946
the original structure of the synovial membrane is completely destroyed in the rheumatoid synovium and is characterized by UNK cell infiltration , UNK proliferation , neo - vascularization , and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins .    3.1673402540381286
in this review we discuss the role of the adhesion receptors of the selectin , UNK and UNK families and of the cd44 molecule in the cell - cell and cell - matrix interaction in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory changes in rheumatoid arthritis .    3.204257156828157
during the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results , using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone ( UNK ) for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose .    3.3264376254613865
until now , however , no investigations have been undertaken , dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration - effect relationship .    3.1471107422678855
secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects .    3.6701255389037266
background : intraoperative measurements of local UNK hemoglobin oxygenation of the human cochlea via the round window membrane have been shown to be possible using the erlangen microlight - guided spectrophotometer .    3.1916907933000416
the aim of the present study was to develop a new microlight guide suitable for measurements in the round window niche and to evaluate UNK the possible impact of the procedure on the cochlea .    3.002836511483894
high - dose uva1 therapy is an effective treatment of patients with acute atopic dermatitis .    3.645827299526395
however , some patients do not respond well to this new therapy .    2.936353857284709
we attempted to further characterize the non - UNK population in a retrospective study .    3.7073575989514165
two closely matched groups of responders ( n = 20 ) and non - responders ( n = 20 ) were compared .    3.427936759463665
no significant differences were observed between both groups with respect to the following parameters : skin type , minimal erythema dose , single and cumulative doses of uva1 , and peripheral blood UNK .    3.0644319149384622
however , non - responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score , and by high levels of total ige and of specific ige .    3.7973041248768413
these data indicate that high - dose uva1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis .    3.9105686574341525
we conclude that non - responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high - dose uva1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment .    3.0856358390132668
introduction : many causes are given as the main reason for inadequate pain therapy .    3.249614079154449
the objective of our study was to demonstrate the current position of doctors in general practice all over austria who prescribe prescriptions .    2.8098834917101856
we report a woman with erythema UNK UNK , an anomaly not documented so far in the german literature .    3.309617418104688
it is transmitted in an autosomal - recessive mode and has a benign course .    3.4602054770848074
in our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations .    3.1362180885576247
the decline of std in the region of rostock , germany , since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of UNK and UNK .    3.3820040543762224
on the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased .    2.6567308321019256
the rate of chlamydia infections was about 45 % in our UNK patients , as common as UNK used to be .    3.6580137684692517
genital candidal infections were to be found in 23 % .    3.587156185199835
UNK were identified in 15 % , usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of UNK .    4.128860811773159
the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of hodgkin ' s disease and non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades .    3.5781615865430982
clinical observation of mainly UNK pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large - field technique with total nodal irradiation ( UNK ) or total lymphatic irradiation ( UNK ) .    3.398683881222197
the introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk .    3.357385899563573
today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions ( involved field irradiation = UNK ) .    3.7287977278151527
the german society of oral and maxillofacial surgery was founded by martin waßmund in UNK .    2.8038832559753417
one of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention .    3.363884338641268
the society , originally composed of 52 members , was first called " the german society of maxillofacial surgery " .    3.1038665725487915
in 1972 , it extended its UNK to include the term " oral " ( " mund " ) and currently comprises UNK members .    3.4020471896227598
a scientific conference is held annually on a specific topic .    3.0881303175289934
the UNK given there have been published since UNK in " UNK der kiefer - und gesichts - chirurgie " ( progress in maxillofacial surgery ) by UNK verlag ; since 1997 , they have appeared as a springer - verlag supplement .    3.0139024122615683
topics of choice are published in " mund , - kiefer - und UNK " ( " oral and maxillofacial surgery " ) , originally by UNK in munich and now by springer - verlag in heidelberg .    3.409419069530415
in this manner , it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty .    3.160846711372447
each year since 1957 , a prize named after m . waßmund , has been given for outstanding scientific UNK .    3.019463439909667
the UNK , convention locations , topics , and UNK are listed in a table .    3.8420933624126965
since the founding of the society of oral and maxillofacial surgery , close cooperation has existed with the national association of german oral and maxillary - facial surgeons ( UNK der UNK UNK für mund - kiefer - gesichts - chirurgie ) .    2.626457934073479
in order to UNK scientific and political interests , a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year 2000 .    3.150369074657433
the UNK syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment .    4.31566264876715
the pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood .    2.9179728798851454
of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume .    3.523422502476604
as a consequence changes in several different pathophysiological mechanisms ( sympathetic nervous system , renin - angiotensin system , vasopressin , endothelin , UNK , natriuretic peptides ) lead to a functional renal impairment which is characterized by renal cortical vasoconstriction .    3.2008415050219785
supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients .    4.308987865135087
the mortality is still high exceeding 90 % .    3.1450912968264104
renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected ( acute liver failure , waiting for liver transplantation ) .    3.0842659888705146
the only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation .    2.7605426085048577
a 16 year old patient with the typical clinical signs of albright ' s hereditary UNK developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness , tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue .    3.1274586100777655
after termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs .    2.719048914948063
electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing .    3.7282261470819344
in laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia ( 1 . 15 mmol / l ) and UNK .    3.651519184070732
blood parathyroid hormone ( pth ) was elevated .    2.8774779156420642
pth - test confirmed the diagnosis of UNK .    3.749921459960978
the patient was treated with calcium and 1 , 25 - UNK - UNK .    3.363514203623863
after few days the severe encephalopathy , ct and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible .    3.310982912497586
hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases .    3.5485117917883655
hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and UNK treatment .    3.4453305539075676
an adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine , placental and fetal growth .    2.9554216702498173
maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus .    3.2329045091716977
thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival .    3.3070733553837264
reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both .    3.614947539085409
chronic reductions of uterine blood flow can be observed in pregnancy induced UNK ( UNK ) , diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and intrauterine growth restriction ( iugr ) .    3.3515931102329266
chronic restrictions in uterine blood flow will elicit a placental and fetal response in the form of growth adaptation to the reduced supply of oxygen and nutrients to the UNK .    3.2740888915958912
if compensatory growth restriction reaches its limits intrauterine fetal distress can ensue .    2.90013831641062
in view of a possible stent implantation , 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated .    2.854612873957268
measurements were performed according to UNK criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters .    3.278190979305419
then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters , respectively .    3.039804953815597
the following results were obtained : 1 .    3.564848304754371
depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm , there is an UNK shortening of the proximal and distal neck .    4.290606032143031
up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases .    2.7165755104446387
with lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results , the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple tube - stent .    3.7977990174551812
the proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm .    3.0550712555795365
for longer aneurysms , only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation .    3.6674363008724082
in all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall - adherent thrombi of up to three UNK thickness in the aneurysmal and para - aneurysmal regions .    2.8445075871199434
these findings have to be considered , with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta .    3.6820611632251756
we report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48 - year - old man .    2.676390077468746
these slow - growing , mostly benign and encapsulated UNK - UNK tumours are clinically characterized by UNK , paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as UNK - UNK by incontinence .    4.1511610232381075
paragangliomas of the cauda equina show UNK ( main ) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern , demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so - called sustentacular cells ; some tumours show focal UNK differentiation .    2.6523729793722346
because of their morphological similarity to the more common UNK , paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated .    2.9845041704594513
immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron - specific enolase , UNK and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides ( main cells ) and s - 100 protein ( sustentacular cells ) while widely lacking reactivity for gfap .    3.430400791045777
paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity , of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature .    2.858070109758804
because they only occur sporadically , they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina .    3.7408778183102074
approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence .    3.3308288934070447
the treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence , the type of primary therapy administered and the patient ' s general condition .    3.588442323175363
in general , empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned .    2.7424763109212984
the main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences .    4.116699711816605
post - traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease .    3.0709736907338363
we present the case of a 38 - year - old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma .    2.570935097806548
the patient had a UNK lasting 3 months before presenting in our department .    2.8561705734465184
the therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage .    2.8286339612176348
clinical signs , diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report .    4.353932310436577
the dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his / her facility : admission , diagnosis , treatment , transfer , and discharge of patients .    2.978557731977889
however , in developing such general hospital information systems , one runs into the following problems : ( 1 ) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment ; ( 2 ) the structure of medical information is extremely complex , except for certain limited administrative data ( admission , transfer , and discharge , for example ) needed by the clinic administration .    3.098252228989454
as a result it is nearly impossible to transfer medical information from one system to another without a loss of data .    3.016078221575278
one cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years .    2.915487662598707
therefore we present a concept which , based on existing tools , allows communication between medical information systems .    3.3099027668550747
speed , simplicity , and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences .    3.8047588305508757
in this study , the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated .    2.402221858234882
the congenital UNK UNK represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia .    3.0647542444587863
they are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy .    3.188632458365188
there are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity , cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane .    3.1065063411180294
in addition , patients with apparent cda of heterogenous phenotype are observed , that cannot be attributed to any of the three types .    3.493272993735085
recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22 .    3.172375407044232
cases of cda were reported from many UNK , in particular in families of UNK origin .    3.6453506610576683
gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence .    3.608800335957389
therapeutic measures such as splenectomy , treatment by interferon or allogeneic UNK marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression , which shows large variations both within and between affected UNK .    3.251147067350117
UNK is a constant in aging .    3.1552842326739294
observed over long periods , it can reach 1 % per year .    3.8121851069210444
but it is such a UNK phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state .    2.983927712188356
chronic venous insufficiency ( cvi ) is characterised by stage - dependent microangiopathy .    3.4082370425638153
the cutaneous vascular reserve , which is measured by laser - doppler UNK , is reduced .    3.890433176145335
cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with cvi .    3.086141900841109
low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as UNK the formation of granulation tissue .    3.320030324067829
in a open prospective pilot study , 15 patients suffering from cvi with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current ( UNK ) , which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation .    3.8170090358980255
the average age of the patients was 70 . 3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79 . 1 months .    3.4682213316659736
the patients were treated over a period of 38 days .    3.4052076391921777
with this UNK , 2 ulcers healed completely and 13 showed a reduction of size of on average 63 % .    3.492614781140819
capillary density increased by 43 . 5 % , while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82 . 4 % .    3.5622292611292026
electrostimulation is a treatment with few or no side effects .    3.696779296448993
from 1986 to 1996 , we implanted a total of 92 hip arthroplasties ( 86 cementless , 4 hybrid and 2 cemented ) in 65 patients with rheumatoid arthritis .    3.042072548359567
of the 89 uncemented cups , 59 were threaded cups ( UNK - UNK n = 45 , zweymüller n = 7 , UNK n = 5 , pm n = 2 ) and 30 were UNK cups of the harris UNK type i and ii .    3.361493942583667
87 stems were implanted without cement ( zweymüller sl n = 58 , uni n = 16 , schenker n = 9 , zweymüller i n = 4 ) and 5 with cement .    3.2660076129078432
one patient died postoperatively and three ( 4 implants ) within the first year .    3.0768768536935984
to date , one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening ( revision rate approx .    2.8703072338935964
6 . 8 % ) ; up to now , three of 87 ( approx .    4.10223819857413
3 . 4 % ) stem revisions ( 1 x zweymüller i , 1 x schenker , 1 x zweymüller sl ) have been undertaken .    3.390909342032405
ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow - up ; some of them had a poor general health status .    3.405311591912621
the clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a harris hip score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months ( min .    3.5825566559667092
ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region .    3.0521888446089953
79 % of the uncemented implants ( 70 out of 89 cups , 69 out of 87 stems ) were assessed radiologically .    3.525224301763681
two threaded cups showed slight migration after cancellous bone grafting in the presence of acetabular protrusion that was present in a total of 13 hip joints .    3.586625277892936
this subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and UNK of the hip joint .    3.622469358996698
homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved , with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction .    4.19693423683985
at final follow - up , approx .    3.6932211512805515
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of UNK ( type i ) , approx .    3.4490974246344965
19 % had near - complete bone ingrowth with minimal radiolucencies in one zone or in a maximum of 50 % of the bone contact area ( type ii ) and approx .    3.2120821865702793
6 % had radiolucencies in more than 50 % of the bone contact area ( type iii ) .    3.0064785128914724
the radiographic evaluation of the most frequently used stem ( zweymüller sl ) showed approx .    3.7286575031939364

abstract the 5th edition of the tnm classification UNK a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors .    2.952121881442236
the division of stage iv tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure .    2.9621033927436744
methods : in a retrospective study the clinical course of UNK patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th UNK of the new tnm classification .    3.7825216945149003
in particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the UNK of stage iv especially in mucosal cancer .    3.747819637850521
results : in classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors .    2.9362008043058894
on the basis of the 4th edition of the tnm classification the following recurrence - free 5 - year survival rates for UNK cases of mucosal cancer were calculated : stage i 91 , 0 % , stage ii 78 , 6 % , stage iii 61 , 4 % , stage iv 31 , 0 % .    3.3401544309816846
conclusions : the adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed .    2.672205090200157
however , a significant prognostic distinction between n2 - ( stage iva ) and n3 - metastasis ( stage ivb ) could not be found .    2.9787381927207828
the microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue , and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell .    3.603222603033816
modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high - resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer - assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock - out gene technology .    3.2923413309164484
these advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation , ischemia - reperfusion , and transplantation .    2.8424190549208683
legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) in germany .    3.1065855399849864
this article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against pgd .    2.9010349647266023
UNK in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept pgd are highlighted .    2.773277912563753
the use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing pgd is UNK .    3.050535612991312
extensive counselling prior to pgd should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision .    3.5276675961056125
the sofa score , a new system for patients with sepsis - related diseases , was introduced in 1994 by the " working group on sepsis - related problems of the european society of intensive care medicine . "    3.838584580037894
the purpose of this study was to compare the new sofa score with the apache ii and mod scores .    2.419351543668583
the data on UNK patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software ( spss for windows , version 7 . 5 . 2 and ms excel ' 97 ) .    3.334062244517446
to compare the different scores , UNK - operating characteristics ( roc ) - analyses were applied .    3.563728320121921
the study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated sofa score and the mortality of the patients during their icu stay ( score 0 - > mortality 0 % , 1 - > 3 . 6 % , 2 - > 22 . 5 % , 3 - > 86 , 7 % , respectively r = 0 . 445 ; p = 0 , 01 ) .    4.239188651878703
the roc analyses of the apache ii , the mod and the sofa scores were comparable ( area under the curve : apache ii 0 . 73 , mod 0 . 77 , sofa 0 . 71 ) .    2.754178329279173
in conclusion , the sofa score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit .    2.658428290050073
in individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( hnscc ) , established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome .    2.9709936372876404
for the first time we investigated a total of 100 hnscc by comparative genomic hybridization ( cgh ) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis .    3.3710769878661764
patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death .    3.465586607704834
during this observation period twenty - nine of them died because of cancer disease .    3.316781441326247
the kaplan - meier method was used UNK survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico - pathological parameter .    3.2310576710255665
the curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the breslow test .    3.508325404028261
significance of particular prognostic parameters was then evaluated by the cox regression model .    3.3044555942630813
the overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who ' s tumors showed UNK of the chromosomal region 11q13 ( p = 0 . 0008 for lr and p = 0 . UNK for b ) .    3.216597323624347
the survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried UNK of chromosome 3q ( p = 0 . UNK for lr and p = 0 . UNK for b ) .    3.0429306049358305
multivariate analysis ( cox ' s proportional hazards model ) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in hnscc .    2.8059374273730637
none of the conventional clinico - pathological parameters ( pt - , pn - status , uicc stage , grading ) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model .    2.8911120072427754
these results suggest that in hnscc the occurence of 11q13 amplification and 3q UNK are highly significant independent prognostic markers and of better value than the established tnm and grading criteria .    2.7723732692453456
we report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient .    3.241645767999928
the UNK cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed s - 100 and vimentin .    3.0357610793939616
hmb45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma .    3.744801358530612
detection of hmb45 in some of the nevus - associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation .    3.5420055414886247
we present , to the best of our knowledge , the first case of a malignant , primary plaque - type blue naevus in a 61 - year - old male .    3.4494508286277656
two biopsy specimens had been examined within 13 years , and revealed a common and cellular blue variant as a precursor .    3.4566466029054332
locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present , but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features , as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi .    3.6228489139258504
the recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus .    3.465632045532194
it is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in germany .    3.3460963476271424
the lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data , a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals .    3.4789978099969794
the incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100 , 000 inhabitants .    2.925650435408144
the increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol - induced pancreatitis .    3.794895575290219
one may UNK that due to improved diagnostic possibilities , such as ct scan , cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare .    3.5279718505534645
due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in germany similar to well - documented data from denmark .    3.833559268028491
since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100 , 000 inhabitants will also decrease .    3.2313573247438545
process - experiential ( pe ) therapy is a neo - humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client - centered emphasis on a genuine , UNK , empathic relationship and the active , task - focused process - directive style of gestalt therapie .    1.7152252044101002
this form of treatment is scientifically validated ( grawe 1997 ) .    3.0498498873419
its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory .    1.909122677254924
it incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks , each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state , series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution , and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps .    1.6637607896176037
this second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks .    3.1903757935754204
at last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed , and available outcome data is summarized .    3.2375356944108895
the human arterial blood pressure shows not only UNK alterations , but also spontaneous fluctuations .    3.849876470787556
this blood pressure variability has both scientific and clinical relevance .    3.5228132905371106
a well - known phenomenon is the so - called " white coat UNK " which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension .    3.287004016606207
furthermore , several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end - organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the UNK blood pressure variability .    4.1661925772394905
therefore , it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration .    3.6024771077387148
the faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography ( ct ) feature of small - bowel obstruction and is seen as a UNK , faeces - like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle .    2.994710717517472
to evaluate its prevalence , significance , and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small - intestine obstruction studied with ct in the last 6 years .    3.2896590125195337
the faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases ( 7 . 4 % ) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects .    3.1799874760154427
in 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction , while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1 .    3.492866789792857
the faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction .    3.038775071765352
in our experience it is relatively uncommon .    2.6297814349183013
nevertheless , it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the ct study of small - bowel obstruction .    3.6631457203881976
a case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia .    3.304145691409473
knowledge of the related skin lesions may lead to earlier detection of this myeloproliferative disorder .    3.533990746785606
UNK is causally related to thrombocythaemia ; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical .    2.983341181849023
surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of UNK replacement of valve and aorta .    3.2997940379491864
recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated UNK of mechanical heart valves .    3.3450374998402075
two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine .    3.0527527244770796
in one case the elevated glucose concentrations returned to normal soon after withdrawal of olanzapine .    2.7037493965063057
in the second case severe ketoacidosis with UNK outcome occured .    2.638171356177499
UNK is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure .    3.061303193037448
with the help of a synthetic material a negative image of a defined area of the skin is taken .    3.4388582074963168
during the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a UNK .    3.3553006459419867
a commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results .    3.5171809459113885
this procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen UNK on the structure of the skin surface on the face .    3.8492364549026803
this article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) from the first experiments at UNK until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899 .    2.6404031386465303
in 1869 , UNK UNK UNK the chemical structure of salicylic acid , which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug .    3.6460520617586876
because of the side effects , for example the irritation of the stomach , analytical UNK and UNK searched for chemical modifications .    4.118774314965124
in august 1897 UNK hoffmann ( UNK - UNK ) was successful in UNK the salicylic acid to UNK acid ( asa ) .    3.691463639788271
between 1897 and 1899 UNK UNK ( UNK - UNK ) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of asa as an analgetic and antipyretic drug .    3.2931327922580964
in 1899 asa was introduced into the UNK market as aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time .    3.4998287265448793
the indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke , among others .    3.300942113168532
background : the results of the UNK - UNK group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity .    3.631448957742435
structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent UNK in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age .    3.1614086570213296
despite wide - spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten UNK of deaths worldwide , every year , especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons .    3.26737114422172
at present , amantadine and UNK are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use , yet , the deployment of these substances is problematic : neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza b , their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance , and they show many adverse effects .    3.3970969934895012
in contrast , zanamivir and gs4071 / gs4104 are rationally developed influenza - specific neuraminidase inhibitors , proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza a and b , as well in vitro as in animal models , and in experimental human studies .    3.1469319256245125
zanamivir and gs4071 / gs4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration , respectively .    2.8124340146018207
resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs , but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear .    4.368401503672736
to date , the biggest recognizable disadvantage of neuraminidase inhibitors and UNK / UNK alike is that they need to be given within 30 - 48 h after onset of symptoms , but seeking medical attention at this stage of infection does not seem to be realistic in medical practice .    3.0704219230889516
as neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data , specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity , course of infection , and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy .    3.740544141355182
background and purpose : without recanalisation , acute basilar artery ( ba ) occlusion has a mortality of 90 % , which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved .    3.229484904510119
fast diagnosis of ba occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay .    3.755841898839264
we wanted to assess the role of ct angiography ( UNK ) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute ba occlusion .    4.261985372979817
25 patients with coronary heart disease ( chd , 62 + / - 9 years ) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease ( 28 + / - 9 years ) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol : a ) in the common upright position , b ) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi - supine position .    3.463582504444725
whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate , blood pressure , and rate - pressure product ( 2 x 3 anova , t - test with - adjustment ) , the chd patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate - pressure product ( 50 w : 15 300 + / - UNK mmhg / min vs . 13 UNK + / - UNK mmhg / min ; 75 w : 18 UNK + / - UNK mmhg / min vs 16 UNK + / - UNK mmhg / min ) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position .    3.2923138242488355
there were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group ; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 w . lactate concentrations ( determined only in the healthy subjects ) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography .    3.3896699275621684
the workload at the individual anaerobic threshold ( UNK ) was significantly lower .    4.465427312971525
a new UNK mixture of 27 % UNK - phosphate ( UNK ) and 73 % UNK - calcium - phosphate ( UNK ) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a UNK that subsequently sets to a structurally UNK implant composed of hydroxyapatite ( ha ) .    3.342882917379526
primary setting time is about 20 min ; ph during setting ranges from 6 . 5 to 8 . 5 .    3.786850910427937
there is no relevant UNK heat or expansion or contraction .    2.866506422142469
compressive strength is about 50 mpa , tensile strength about 8 mpa .    3.179292955897382
over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu , the cement UNK to hydroxyapatite .    2.990264171197937
this product is no longer UNK in normal body fluid .    3.4265775487809362
this cement can be used for non - load - bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery .    3.5412936967597277
cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial .    3.6835469688552713
in nine of ten patients we used the hydroxyapatite cement successfully for reconstructions in the craniofacial area .    3.2455192365742325
fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve .    4.1321331108313295
further applications could be all non - load - bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses , of UNK cysts and defects following dental UNK or fixation of implanted hearing - aid electrodes .    2.801605571874351
the perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations , especially because of its UNK reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics .    2.7923289429138154
we present a non - invasive epilepsy surgery protocol , which includes eeg - video - monitoring , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , interictal positron emission tomography ( pet ) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography ( spect ) .    2.5634923793398867
according to this non - invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery .    2.8086653124238827
the localization of the epileptogenic zone was based on the UNK of the localizing results of eeg - video - UNK , mri , interictal pet and ictal spect .    3.651927189848755
46 ( 92 % ) of the patients had temporal and 4 ( 8 % ) had UNK epilepsies .    4.36124515419413
78 % ( n = 39 ) of all patients operated according to our non - invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free .    4.075827174153553
UNK resections could be carried out without invasive eeg - recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the UNK cortex .    3.2917757184260545
we conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies , resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non - invasive eeg - evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided .    3.6912024350570354
necrolytic migratory erythema ( nme ) is mostly associated with a pancreatic - a - cell - UNK and is considered to be a well - defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome .    4.061342851888552
we report on a 74 - year old female who atypically developed a nme after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma .    3.313006914904768
continuous staging and laboratory investigation over four years gave no evidence of any metastasis or further neoplasia .    3.1924016831487574
hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts ( n = 18 ) under constant methadone treatment were investigated .    3.221352134799212
hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone , opiates and cocaine by gc / ms .    3.092602463824728
the results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface , methadone being the main UNK .    3.4678413816471756
the perspiration test period lasted for 4 days .    3.214944928978147
for six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found .    3.1809207278306446
overall , a poor relationship ( r = 0 , UNK ) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair .    3.8150800234790774
the results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects , drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation .    2.901758563426859
bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt UNK trauma .    3.342716399664114
the diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits .    3.0015734812905817
neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion .    3.353810026228433
angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination .    4.005301687854229
initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration .    3.1922158226385213
they point out the practical use of their findings in daily practice .    3.2434550310688044
abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmhg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria .    3.3045922420948677
in primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis , ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma .    2.936550726177464
secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery .    3.5968506001429006
the effects are decreased cardiac output , pulmonary atelectasis , oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion .    3.3416999965358642
effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure .    3.5285546677053943
normal values are between 0 and 7 cm h2o , after elective laparotomies 5 - 12 cm h20 .    3.4129181835857585
above 25 cm h20 they are definitely pathological .    3.454657583629991
for the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended .    3.479014876094446
between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in UNK patients .    2.9728438411653166
in 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31 + / - 4 cm h20 preoperatively , which could be lowered to 17 + / - 4 cm h20 by laparostomy .    3.4587941398201174
an early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases .    4.142671945585425
conclusions : the abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems .    2.8177954044316267
the temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances .    3.397556286554852
in general , assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by UNK chest x - ray .    3.0337222839444826
we report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59 - year - old male patient that was not detectable in chest films .    2.786175506598128
definition of the problem : in 1997 , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) was performed in 138 . 001 cases in germany .    2.9594885630667935
the standard indications , single vessel disease and UNK controlled angina , are more and more extended to UNK disease with and without severe angina , unstable or UNK angina , and acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) itself .    3.284896323955737
UNK asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70 - 80 % is a widely used indication , intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and ami .    3.447715092040888
actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications , conservative versus invasive treatment schedule .    3.3994884519515085
it is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods ; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position .    3.422067813291018
in 1992 the working group called " arbeitsgemeinschaft UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) " decided to start a registry of all ptca procedures , in order to gain knowledge about the present status of ptca in germany .    3.4451132443497947
up to march 1999 , UNK . 608 ptca are UNK .    3.4331301097363554
two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic UNK in one and for non - hodgkin lymphoma in the other .    3.2792171976227493
induction of naevi does not seem to be related to specific agents used in chemotherapy , but rather to the immunosuppression resulting from multiple - agent chemotherapy .    3.0142891361411355
there are reports in the literature of both UNK and UNK immunosuppressed patients who have developed multiple melanocytic naevi .    3.9175553251982773
many small randomized studies with < beta > - blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years .    3.1280837754549
a large meta - analysis by UNK combining 18 studies with UNK patients showed a 32 % reduction in mortality in patients treated with < beta > - blockers .    3.0364438918008156
mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37 % .    3.0843678221961164
in 1998 two large randomized trials investigating UNK ( UNK ii ) and metoprolol ( UNK - UNK ) were finished .    4.09800093387731
both studies show a significant reduction in mortality in patients treated with < beta > - blockers .    2.811245089887137
the ongoing UNK study compares < beta > 1 - selective blockers like metoprolol with UNK < beta > - blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure .    2.959915366343036
large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of < beta > - blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure .    2.962378325664149
all patients with UNK chronic heart failure ought to be treated with < beta > - blockers additional to a basic therapy with ace inhibitors , diuretics , and digitalis .    3.0887289359817967
the < beta > - blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully : " start low and go slow " .    3.0454268113901866
purpose : cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers , valves , great vessels and the coronary arteries , chamber and valvular function , myocardial perfusion , viability and metabolism .    3.453262904733085
surprisingly , angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .    2.9457662901789683
new onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest UNK demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt - pa . spiral computed tomography revealed overt type b aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma .    3.2238002834663506
immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed .    3.325486960853681
a literature review revealed 4 % of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13 % to have concomitant coronary artery disease ; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64 % UNK the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to UNK therapy .    3.4221208807264794
between 1984 and 1996 we performed a mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity : 14 patients ( average age 40 ( 26 - 48 ) years , body mass index ( bmi ) 48 ( 37 - 71 ) kg / m2 , excessive body weight 67 ( 41 - 116 ) kg ) .    2.8832661619183253
since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding ( lab band ) : 73 patients ( average age 39 ( 22 - 64 ) years , bmi 45 ( 32 - 69 ) kg / m2 , excessive body weight 66 ( 41 - 116 ) kg ) .    2.691715290026458
we compared the early and late results of both methods .    3.3106182069335413
early results : no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method .    3.138081937275662
late / intermediate results : reoperation rate for both methods 15 % .    3.2687064819760567
after an average of 3 . 7 years the excessive body weight loss ( ewl ) for gastroplasty was 54 ( 22 - 96 ) % .    3.0050524289562612
the ewl after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 ( 11 - 127 ) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 ( 28 - 139 ) % .    3.199025437888693
since the introduction of the UNK band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased .    3.97681228710943
nevertheless , the perioperative complication rate has remained low , and the long - term outcome is similar for both methods .    3.7264265678185655
we investigated the relationships between prolactin ( prl ) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .    2.3521891006708824
no significant association between prl levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied ( anti - u1 UNK , anti - UNK , anti - UNK , anti - UNK , anti - UNK , auto - UNK , anti - UNK ) could be confirmed ( p > 0 . 05 ) , anti - ro / ssa antibodies being an exception .    3.235823338097854
our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female sle patients with normal prl levels ( < 20 µg / l ) : anti ro / ssa in 53 % ( p < 0 . UNK , 2 = 5 . 80 , rr = 4 . 0 ) and anti - ro / ssa + anti - ro / la in 60 % ( p < 0 . 05 , 2 = 4 . 05 ) compared with female sle patients with UNK .    3.418745066304829
an UNK cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade .    3.548877032227278
we report on a 24 year old male from the UNK who was brought in an emergency state from a UNK hospital complaining of severe dyspnea , thoracic pain , dizziness , and a short period of unconsciousness .    3.462707119040652
we report on the case of a 51 - year - old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years .    2.794026165323733
some of these lesions were classified clinically and histologically as keratoacanthomas ( ka ) , whereas the multiple smaller nodules were found on histological examination to be either early stage ka or lesions of prurigo simplex UNK .    3.2065701830991333
in two ka , hpv subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization .    3.183918495843917
treatment with etretinate resulted in remission of the fully developed ka and reduced the occurrence of new ones .    3.233392149851368
the outbreak of multiple ka in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by UNK and UNK .    3.2234295715583086
this mode of prurigo - dependent ka development has not previously been reported .    2.940279096315356
we describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor ( a so - called mesothelioma ) of the atrioventricular nodal region .    3.5677471932655482
at autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and UNK the right coronary UNK , leading to an acute , recurring myocardial infarction .    4.443614514434757
histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node .    3.7291941004507376
to our knowledge , this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors .    2.4705400393046624
although still rare , pregnancy and delivery in women with spinal cord injuries is becoming more frequent ( table 2 ) .    3.108908989805783
in 85 % - 90 % of patients with lesions above UNK symptoms of autonomic hyperreflexia ( table 1 ) , especially paroxysmal and excessive increases in arterial blood pressure , may occur .    3.779114740830505
in UNK a 31 - year - old UNK UNK with a complete transverse spinal lesion at t4 for an elective caesarean section , no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra - or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine .    3.200959027293813
distinct intraoperative UNK of the abdominal wall muscles was , however , not influenced by the dosages selected .    4.817142217478855
repetitive magnetic stimulation ( rtms ) is a non - invasive , painless method to induce transient activation in UNK regions of the human cortex .    3.7041920563654434
in contrast to tms with single pulses rtms allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas .    2.7783348354113104
possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation , memory functions and visual perception are discussed .    3.3250308637597823
possible therapeutic for movement disorders and depression are discussed .    3.1131482609845476
on the basis of theoretical considerations and current experience rtms induced epileptogenic effects are discussed and safety recommendations are given .    2.892559014471748
an unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been UNK to death .    3.8572130366320545
physical examination of the victim ' s numerous male UNK revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger .    4.033971399229996
molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding dna patterns ( frequency 1 : 700 000 ) .    2.8501447500506285
this case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation .    3.048097236296154
nineteen men with post - prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade ii and iii ( mean follow - up 12 . 7 months ) underwent periurethral injections of collagen .    3.6380891688236394
in all , 37 procedures were performed ; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice .    3.4042843041336672
a mean of 16 ml collagen was injected .    3.163653422591253
the results were successful directly after injections , leaving all patients continent ; however , after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively .    3.3817433760226345
no perioperative complications were noted .    3.5635302599096588
despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure , men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections .    3.1652757783893266
against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned , the patient UNK threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again .    2.9621665217578257
this psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and UNK the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security .    3.5187541335381614
therefore , the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned .    3.001387988204881
the follow - up period in 51 patients was 2 . 4 years ( operated group = 28 patients , conservative group = 23 patients ) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion .    3.5001187155750917
after surgical treatment , minor wound infections occurred in 10 . 6 % .    3.546592999155613
UNK occurred in 13 % of the conservative group .    4.342412724645068
in the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13 . 7 % lower than in the UNK leg and decreased significantly with non - operative treatment to 75 . 3 % ( p = 0 . 012 ) .    4.344827923646839
we recommend surgical treatment of acute atr .    4.128510295239891
the indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture ( measured by ultrasound in the equinus position ) , the desired level of daily activity and the patient ' s degree of compliance .    3.8268358014374573
" UNK " promises to become a reliable method for UNK the sex of our children .    3.9912167540100083
as so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology , however , sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues .    3.615908100734319
in this paper , we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban .    2.9758536071133808
since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others , we argue in favour of the UNK of sex selection .    3.6099634667948055
acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery .    3.267778646544287
in about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia .    3.8807342868818795
in the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage .    2.9326644655978646
the introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses .    3.551305703859384
more complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease .    3.5471723339468935
the mortality of these emergency operations is still 10 - 20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80 - 90 % .    3.1039637686498054
infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue , often requiring intensive care management .    3.138461232223093
these infections may be lethal if empirical broad - spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection ( i . e . , fever ) , and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice .    3.4655369105798353
however , the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years .    2.9543723663580574
after reviewing some particularities of infection in UNK patients , this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non - infectious diseases specialist , including recent advances about early iv - oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management .    3.356206836523358
background : it has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes ( acs ) .    2.8044301935104476
c - reactive protein ( crp ) is a classic acute phase protein .    2.945788359308329
it is yet unclear whether , in addition to established markers as troponin t ( tnt ) , determination of crp in patients admitted for acs contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of acs . patients and methods : we investigated 50 patients with acs ( 59 . 4 sd 13 . 9 years ) in the first hour after admission and 4 - 24h later with respect to tnt ( UNK , UNK diagnostics ) and crp ( UNK , modified UNK crp plus , analytical sensitivity 0 . UNK / dl ) .    3.8378935050291973
fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively .    3.9915465999000155
all patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent acs . results : the cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62 . 5 % for patients being crp and tnt positive compared to 35 . 3 % in tnt positive and crp negative patients .    3.244370128400132
in tnt negative patients a positive crp test predicted 33 . 3 % of events and 28 . 8 % of patients negative for crp and tnt had events at 42 days post discharge .    3.5330435465393317
sensitivity / specificity for ami diagnosis were 69 . 6 % / 75 % for tnt and 12 % / 72 % for crp in the first hour and 91 . 3 % / 68 . 2 % for tnt and 68 % / 72 % for crp 4 - 24h later . conclusions : besides tnt , high sensitivity crp determination has no additional value for early ami diagnosis .    3.1927444376884915
the prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by crp measurements in addition to troponin t .    3.9544060670986
purpose : evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation .    3.646041044808068
following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30 % of cases , depending mainly on graft age .    3.4071650587393734
selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology , left ventricular performance , comorbidity and availability of graft material .    2.9680276496633953
UNK interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible , but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected .    3.1944124528022697
repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality , patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery .    3.3831559066244137
we report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a UNK - graft supplying UNK , lad and UNK sequentially , making reintervention necessary .    2.9950153748116795
as a prerequisite serial balloon angioplasty of two native vessels was performed prior to ostial intervention .    2.9783448917461857
intravascular - ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long - term result .    3.579027258467286
our case demonstrates that , if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account , complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk , thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations .    3.177384820031557
in recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted .    3.460511211136813
the use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast - conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety .    3.16885851396476
the breast - to - tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1 - 2 cm are the most important factors in breast - conserving surgery .    3.78530183048536
different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected , but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected .    3.2626074273683776
other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi - and contralateral breast tissue .    3.3479188457447964
reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations .    3.6116980802415584
the best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection .    3.0073596195381276
oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction .    3.532260782141726
epidermoid cysts are rare , benign tumors of the testis or , less frequently , the inguinal cord .    4.073957262432417
generally , they affect males between 10 and 39 years .    3.048057761421973
in newborns they are rare .    3.4600024118227184
we report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle .    3.259640296236177
although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [ 4 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 16 ] , some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained .    2.981343668234409
reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections .    3.461767888867394
facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy .    2.9889789238854108
since 1991 , 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the berlin center of facial prostheses : 28 received " soft " silicone facial prostheses and 9 " solid " UNK facial prostheses .    3.1855308212133444
in 35 patients protheses were bone - anchored : brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an epitec frame construction in 23 patients .    3.1240177964361506
glue - on prostheses were applied to only two patients .    3.5578454557536654
no intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion .    3.045516578435125
during following visits only minor inflammations were observed around implants and were treated locally .    3.141824762599947
the implant success rate was 78 % for the brånemark implants ( 89 . 7 % in non - radiated areas and 50 % in radiated areas ) and 100 % in radiated and non - radiated areas for the epitec system .    3.6234938400182948
our investigation shows that given the right indication , the bone - anchored facial prosthesis is safe , cosmetically acceptable , uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient .    2.985394710547875
at the age of 19 years the congenital , pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus .    3.19541333378967
thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size , involving the entire left buttock within several months .    3.3304247178882846
multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive , pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle .    3.1105399313953948
both benign and malignant cells were UNK + , vimentin + and hmb - 45 + , but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen .    3.3673005793357875
general examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis .    3.588362280277768
despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy , the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks .    3.681654890276928
this case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may UNK UNK just as a malignant melanoma .    3.2097354152619255
( UNK alert ) hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out - patients with anxiety disorders .    2.959736440020431
a process - oriented approach combining UNK with cognitive - behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined .    3.136663503130851
the use of active alert hypnosis ( hypnosis by bicycle ergometry ) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy .    2.8006159220131717
relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of UNK exposure respectively training of competence .    3.2744188371985103
the treatment is sequentially structured ( motivation , symptom - control , conflict , integration ) .    2.717567765735021
active alert hypnosis UNK the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom - control ( reduction of anxiety and depression ) and of conflict ( UNK of intrapsychic UNK or traumata within UNK induced by physical exercises ) .    3.4522052738361193
therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples .    3.0276374798194454
endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation .    3.4217780054259896
other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery , not at the site of the pathology .    3.4756522426695033
with the transforaminal approach , treatment in the epidural space has become possible .    3.422661222364972
in a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls , risks , and complications of transforaminal surgery .    3.346899853416017
patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented .    4.047428546197609
some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space , excluding extremely medially situated herniations , were treated .    3.200550250634905
we used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia .    2.872665449082894
the treated levels were l5 / s1 ( 11 ) , l4 / 5 ( 12 ) , l3 / 4 ( 3 ) , and l2 / 3 ( 1 ) .    3.469077908293313
all areas could be reached by this approach .    3.2658272716022494
one procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems .    3.5932529676067384
one patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure .    2.9313041694562316
two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain .    2.9109266659512336
no signs of UNK could be found in these cases , but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring .    4.259032654362194
minor complications were UNK root paresthesia and headache postoperatively .    2.8706188147491707
postoperative mri or ct scans revealed only little scar tissue .    3.247808611286769
this impression was supported in the open revisions we performed .    3.3175552187691424
clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly .    3.9231866397611697
endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve , even when surgeons are UNK with the posterolateral approach and UNK surgery .    3.7624481223251505
however , it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery , too .    3.509809305833898
quality management in a rescue coordination center ( rcc ) not only needs an evaluation of quantitative parameters ( such as time intervals ) , but also an examination of the correlation between suspected and real found emergency situations .    3.41379126907294
for that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene .    3.283928886138605
the case of a fatal catheter - induced cardiac tamponade in a 81 - year - old woman is reported .    2.671838613363689
death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding .    3.0458113435819523
according to the clinical and histological findings , placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation .    3.2616232884363745
confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed .    3.109834409177512
despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication , sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out .    2.925698389816512
background : the rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice , e . g . lasik ( laser in situ keratomileusis ) , is associated with new complications .    3.1573943213246425
the limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined .    3.5449671474669544
during lamellar cuts with UNK intraocular pressure ( iop ) elevations occur .    2.904087210416333
due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional mri is the imaging method of choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders .    2.9888998727664706
conventional mr imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments ; however , in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and mr arthrography should be performed .    3.033264575390054
mr arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to UNK the joint , yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures .    3.5203111979524366
this joint distension with mr arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans , since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated .    3.400147393562738
finally , high contrast and joint distension by mr arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies , which often require surgery .    3.2772618739331207
mr arthrography , although invasive , may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders .    2.966483055915574
several studies have demonstrated an association chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease , suggesting that infection with c . pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more .    3.365557656190137
since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process , these data would fit into the response - to - injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept .    3.4801161068549877
several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis , proliferative and UNK effects could transmit the effects of chronic c . pneumoniae infection .    3.3987506134079024
animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of c . pneumoniae in coronary artery disease .    2.7938371090148033
in this paper the current knowledge of the role of c - pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed .    3.282403602471505
preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs .    3.409513529403862
cerebral involvement with the occurence of convulsions is the defining factor for eclampsia .    3.002981879680891
the most prominent signs of cerebral dysfunction include headache , hyperreflexia , visual disturbances , confusion and / or altered state of consciousness .    3.067011162179606
patients usually recover completely however some patients remain disabled due to cerebrovascular damage .    2.8886860819851914
intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia .    3.1563877215453
tcd investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries .    3.2005578312139824
reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early ct - scans and increased signal intensities on t2 - weighted mrt images indicate local edema .    3.1445940482119035
the etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical .    2.9297742940777862
the clinical picture may best be explained by an endothelial dysfunction with increased vascular UNK to circulating pressure agents as well as by a structural endothelial lesion with fluid loss from the intravascular compartment .    3.06562757757035
this article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability .    2.5634060312757834
the treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ( " envelope - of - motion " of the tibia ) by clinical examination , UNK and stress radiography .    4.03164497199197
exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an UNK varus UNK .    3.7503934309603726
this osseous variant in combination with posterior / posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case .    3.543800723246769
the technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described .    3.183098429706089
patellar tendon grafts , quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement .    3.6721270981467096
arthroscopic or mini - open techniques may be used for graft placement , direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts .    3.4255715093624763
UNK ' s biceps plasty or UNK ' s biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization ; a biceps tendon UNK can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction .    3.3402988732022854
results of surgery are still moderate .    3.4007122461848596
in the author ' s series of chronic posterior / posterolateral instability , 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis .    3.477714891212095
follow - up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability ( mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70 ° and 20 UNK force ) and improved knee function ( 33 % ikdc b , 67 % ikdc c ) .    2.9534299223247844
presently , surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers UNK to this problem .    3.3387760614380646
health policy in germany has in recent years given priority to the self - administration of physicians , sickness funds , and hospital associations .    3.273967268385203
hence , legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance , while precise processes are being defined by the self - administration .    2.976971216194506
as prices for health care are increasingly restricted by lump sum UNK , quality and quality assurance become more important as a factor in competition between health care providers .    3.260347092400472
to support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system , the german federal ministry of health has funded model - projects , e . g . , to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care .    3.485878298781242
the research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology , biomaterial science , and surgery .    2.982041436684831
major long - term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients ' own cells .    3.8890441386890178
our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues .    3.261261350068474
the practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three - dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems .    3.0592949802655114
the tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin , UNK , UNK , hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly - hydroxy acids ( UNK / UNK ) .    3.2326091559168235
different technical approaches were established : a ) three - dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b ) interacting three - dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations , such as bmp - transfected mesenchymal cells .    3.620417510330495
the UNK artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre - formation step .    2.8983991785801413
subsequently , pre - formed tissues were implanted into nude mice and into UNK articular joint defects of rabbits .    2.8869174441264005
80 % of the transplants remained stable in vivo .    3.488188532560047
however , 20 % of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue .    3.5643553121378533
these results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction .    2.7018423393758457
the treatment of severe joint defects , however , faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies : ( a ) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints , ( b ) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation , and ( c ) the required enormous mechanical stability .    3.4288105276903815
background : silicon - rubber central venous catheters have become commonplace in the care of premature infants .    2.9451590281030167
we report on a rare complication , fracture and cardiac embolization of a silicone - rubber catheter and its interventional retrieval .    2.819614839008547
the aro multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia , osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis .    3.7330361853883787
in 1987 and 1988 UNK total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study .    3.1279322882580436
UNK prothesis ( 95 , 6 % ) were clinically and radiologically examined .    3.8002927839543483
the follow - up period averaged 6 . 9 years .    3.4203604229791718
the results of the aro multicenter - study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably .    2.9596500180977916
regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups .    4.089023512725885
only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others .    3.3353656872516515
in our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach .    3.114820823805728
patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries .    3.0350789630695045
results of rheumatic patients according to harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups .    3.464762406608734
this was due to systemic involvement and bad preoperative function of the hip .    3.5261057487539174
as a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement .    3.098822865134009
the decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient ' s ability to relief the prothesis after operation .    3.324977883009628
the study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected .    2.966004890247539
sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare , but life - threatening event .    3.7060416408579675
if the right moment is missed , endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection ( sirs ) .    3.1090732570366635
for the UNK developing septic shock , often combined with multiple organ failure ( mof ) , it is not important whether the starting point was an uncontrollable infections focus , ischemic damage following hypovolemic shock , or massive bacterial translocation with postoperative bowel obstruction .    2.903117593320934
the collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections .    2.989796393555708
for early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment , pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed .    2.9443255652462224
the comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients .    3.1666766923562504
specific scores for UNK patients - " abbreviated burn severity index " ( absi ) and the " UNK sepsis scale " ( UNK ) were compared with the general intensive score systems : " mortality prediction model " ( mpm ii ) , " simplified acute physiology score " ( saps ii ) , apache ii ( UNK ) , " hannover intensive score " ( his ) and the sepsis score developed by UNK and UNK ( es ) .    3.964121767769546
on days 1 and 3 the true - positive ratio ( sensitivity ) was UNK against false - positive ratio ( 1 - specifity ) for each score .    3.5932129234278305
the area under the curve ( max .    2.820412022863916
0 . 5 ) correlates with the quality of the score system .    4.859027316651579
we also tested the discrimination of septic and UNK patients by using the different scores .    3.6936594749093876
bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using ct and mri techniques .    3.519436759017481
these unspecific UNK of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis .    3.9062556941194404
they differ from the normal white matter signal .    2.9953179089792235
these changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases .    2.8802773166310183
the pathogenesis , clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear .    2.894700932405641
the aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis .    3.580474335205482
this term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years , with an unilateral onset , asymmetric distribution , and extensive changes all over the infra - and supratentorial white matter area .    3.3169248292145377
neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter , especially enlarged virchow - robin spaces , UNK infarction , subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy ( UNK ' s disease ) , UNK of different origin , and demyelinating diseases .    3.7876334146831194
proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders , because of the UNK nature of its clinical manifestations .    4.106997622667348
it is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems .    3.958842706068939
early diagnosis and careful follow - up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long - term complications .    3.811928354516168
the value of elective pta in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion .    3.1700806300543247
stenoses after surgical and / or radiation therapy and a high cardio - vascular risk for a surgical procedure , however , justify minimal - invasive techniques .    4.214976051404531
profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice .    3.0764158778681945
a three - dimensional ( 3d ) UNK phonogram was constructed based on spl profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded .    2.958867933574694
we have termed this " UNK " .    2.896134139004185
variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of UNK relationships .    3.7877856474653426
the results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with UNK UNK demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3d UNK produced , depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ( " piano " ) compared to loud ( " forte " ) .    3.425251521817893
in one - third of the healthy volunteers , the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all UNK examined .    3.2379985053644638
in two - thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater , as were those of piano voice duration .    2.8877597390979868
all of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano .    3.189224651726788
the results of the study demonstrate that the 3d phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters .    3.032531821101425
sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes , infiltrated by large histiocytes .    3.5469445556812715
these cells show typical UNK , particularly UNK .    3.6266938037772376
other organs may be also involved by this disease , often including the skin .    3.272210475950389
exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare .    4.093594038149352
to exclude other non - x histiocytoses or histiocytosis - x , it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry .    3.560032490766604
we report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis .    2.827329058190783
the case of a five - year - old girl with intractable UNK UNK and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported .    3.3268873831821337
a presacral UNK cyst was shown to be the cause of these symptoms .    3.7037983939553385
extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina .    3.0370841390695014
after verification of the anatomical situation , an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out .    3.6088676278195315
positron emission tomography ( pet ) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion , metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents .    3.472921087656999
the aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas ( hcc ) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by pet .    2.9618437573647287
the ongoing study includes seven patients with child a cirrhosis and hcc ( uicc stage iii - iva ; tumor size 3 - 6 cm ) .    3.048763555872405
dynamic pet studies ( 60 min ) with 18f - fluordeoxyglucose ( fdg ) were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability .    3.2662903995910155
the evaluation of the fdg data demonstrated a liver - equivalent uptake in six of the tumors ( well and moderately differentiated hcc ) , which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma .    3.3871369939438214
one moderately differentiated hcc showed an increased fdg metabolism , indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism .    3.272067900751635
a dose of 37 - 80 UNK 11c - ethanol was applied together with a UNK therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography .    3.699013412797432
five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11c uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11c - ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min .    3.07127571522525
the pet data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11c - ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue .    3.4651824900069457
one case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11c - ethanol concentration due to a UNK of a tumor vein , and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11c uptake in the early phase following UNK injection of the drug .    3.7168966615067935
in conclusion , pet is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of hcc .    3.150554033736583
during the last decade , many investigations were conducted in order to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of acute lung injury ( ali ) or acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .    2.951309856201653
however , the increasing knowledge , instead of clarification , leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies .    2.6979817480707413
indeed , many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ards of one etiology from another .    3.112345495477324
we are still UNK about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ards , while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators .    3.2872624962495047
furthermore , in the clinical arena , there is no clear distinction between pneumonia , severe pneumonia which may lead to ali and then ards .    3.79078447419573
finally , the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge .    3.220557735341053
this review is an analysis by an icu clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors UNK , emphasizing the complex interactions between them .    3.2434722133389795
the present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized .    2.784774177097606
the aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic - therapeutic scoring system ( maris = UNK intensive score ) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems , which are based either only physiologically ( apache ii = acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii ) or only therapeutically ( tiss = therapeutic intervention scoring system ) in medical intensive care medicine .    2.679275894323202
main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality , severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay .    3.1380196807248386
during a 12 - months period ( 1993 / 94 ) , 531 consecutive patients ( icu stay > 4 hours ) being admitted to a medical icu of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated .    3.093571819349063
the day - 1 - scores of maris , apache ii , and tiss were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death .    3.5261027076005016
there was no advantage in using the combined scoring system ( maris ) neither in discrimination between survival and non - survival ( hospital mortality ; areas under the roc - curve : maris = 0 . 84 , apache ii = 0 . 86 , tiss = 0 . 78 ) nor in severity classification ( relationship between day - 1 - scores and hospital mortality : p < 0 . 001 ( chi2 - test ) in all three systems ) .    3.1845256164288083
in contrast only for the combined system ( maris ) , a dependence of length of hospital stay from day - 1 - scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients ( survivors and non - survivors ) ( p < 0 . 001 ; anova ) could be demonstrated .    3.713804443874897
in conclusion the combined physiologic - therapeutic scoring system ( maris ) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients .    2.727975005215209
its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day - 1 - scores and length of hospital stay , which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine .    2.8819938134795455
a 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia , mainly UNK rash and unclear pain .    2.9038928430000337
previously he had shown fever , conjunctivitis and UNK of hands and feet .    3.6738522879895155
laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis , thrombocytosis , anemia , and an elevation of esr and gamma - globulins .    3.023334053404287
no bacterial infection was found .    3.420748504831934
the ecg showed signs of a myocardial ischemia .    3.442285505441915
the sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery .    4.397532132898315
the boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest .    2.912793702707823
the autopsy verified the diagnosis of UNK - syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis .    3.7238275019167015
the etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread .    3.004385536410487
in this paper , UNK cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail .    2.869469511686085
depending on age , history , clinical picture and laboratory results , an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented , which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure .    3.5713696696146577
several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples .    3.6003978610805203
the present study UNK the method of quantitative reverse UNK - polymerase chain reaction ( crt - pcr ) by quantifying , in bovine tissues , the specific mrnas for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism , the low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) - receptor and the 3 - hydroxy - 3 - UNK - UNK a ( hmg - coa ) reductase .    3.251682541340205
our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mrnas .    3.054693162942888
the ldl - receptor mrna expression was highest in the adrenal gland ( 6 . 7 x 104 molecules / ug cellular rna ) followed by the corpus UNK of the ovary , intermediate in the liver ( 8 . 6 x 102 molecules / ug cellular rna ) and not detectable in the large intestine .    2.9314966679667522
expression of the hmg - coa reductase almost paralleled ldl - receptor values .    3.1413422942941045
it was found to be highest in the ovary ( 6 . 1 x 106 molecules / ug cellular rna ) followed by the adrenal gland , intermediate in the liver ( 3 . 1 x 105 molecules / ug cellular rna ) and lowest in the large intestine ( 9 . 9 x 104 molecules / ug cellular rna ) .    2.7612158160935856
these data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches .    3.1934479474424493
thus crt - pcr is a valuable tool for the quantitative analysis of the ldl - receptor and the hmg - coa reductase .    3.0434687616653555
spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non - surgical pain .    3.6813370253241446
central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids .    3.4989565300336904
this review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia , including patient - controlled epidural analgesia .    3.1979238573874547
intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route .    3.3798473235425086
several factors may influence selection of the opioid ; however , in most situations morphine is the drug of choice .    3.5552695321404855
thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia , adverse effects , doses required or pulmonary function .    3.6776240378338203
however , evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is UNK .    3.2826819996256322
however , there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low - risk patients .    2.849460850997159
this contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition , which was held in UNK UNK UNK , germany , may 20 - 21 , 1998 .    4.153713705766906
nutrition can be considered a medical treatment , which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters .    3.576935268954717
with regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient , evaluation of quality of life ( ql ) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters .    3.3304138650549975
quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires .    3.099161084991357
the measurement of ql can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies ( e . g . , percutaneous endoscopic UNK ) .    3.054518894122292
in the individual case , the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for ql may be UNK by other parameters , such as disease or personal changes .    4.078701687089506
however , the information supports decision making about the indication , the route of nutritional therapy , as well as individual follow - up .    3.2170944193251003
using ql as an outcome parameter , carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer .    3.906008378588612
the inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint .    3.5233199928346246
the treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative .    3.931674366757103
the immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments , with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist .    3.4702466267990326
a graduated treatment scheme based on the asif classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur .    4.107906197559985
the majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means ; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement .    3.1481800342386665
the authors ' own patient population is presented in this paper : in these patients fixation with kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used , followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty , and for c - type fractures according to the asif classification or when there is severe soft - tissue damage , application of a fixateur UNK UNK the joint has proved best .    3.8904348435418363
treatment strategy , risks , complications and results are presented .    3.7640427053890315
many couples have to cope with periods of involuntary childlessness and they often ask for medical help .    2.8972559919522687
in the heidelberg project of involuntary childlessness in men , andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year ' s andrological treatment .    3.256913245168404
cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery , despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management .    3.4070785332653197
therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery .    2.8941574961329577
thorough history - taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient ' s individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible .    3.4835491415178264
besides UNK of medical therapy , cardiac UNK and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing .    3.5670464146582104
the etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles .    3.1506729524523576
the standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma , the clinical examination and radiological stress tests .    3.8806935422745776
newer diagnostic methods , up to now not well established in clinical routine , include UNK , UNK - measurements of the pronator muscles , the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic UNK .    3.9505785788566774
conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle UNK and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training .    2.971775713616205
the indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well - documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program .    3.5417233699166712
the surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list : 1 . anatomical repair , eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula , 2 .    3.3479764631904567
UNK - jones tenodesis , and 3 .    3.4222027299010986
UNK - UNK tenodesis to treat a concomittant subtalar instability .    3.166062476556418
no other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers ( hcw ) as the aids pandemic .    3.0810384558700483
numerous epidemiological data , however , have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus ( hiv ) during surgical interventions is low ; it is 0 . 3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures .    3.736609982712956
nevertheless , there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of hiv transmission in the operation theatre , which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood - borne pathogens .    3.249831395548992
in the case of occupational exposure to hiv - contaminated blood or body secretions post - exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material .    2.9863313553933497
abstract pachyonychia congenita ( pc ) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma , follicular keratoses , and mucosal leukokeratoses .    2.5109228193129542
less frequently epidermal cysts , UNK abnormalities , natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen .    2.9705480876329933
diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with pc type i .    3.825240014172017
in contrast individuals affected with pc type ii show premature dentition and multiple UNK cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk .    2.869774988695417
the latter closely resemble UNK UNK hair cysts and UNK multiplex .    3.0007668879453684
by UNK analysis keratin UNK and UNK gene mutations have been detected in patients with pc type i , and keratin UNK and UNK gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with pc type ii .    3.606289209520815
we investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding , administration of blood products , and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem ( dil ) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective cabg .    3.4825430853603483
we retrospectively analyzed the surgical and icu records of cabg patients who had recieved dil ( 27 pats . )    2.9829649828759135
or UNK ( ntg ; 26 pats . )    3.353749256856425
or a combination thereof ( UNK ; 25 pats . ) .    3.270904291795779
there were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to UNK or operative data .    3.4631218212332775
the amount of ctb as well as the use of rbc and ffp were not significantly different between the groups .    3.513173735565365
also , there were no significant differences with regard to hb or th and pt or ptt , both in the early phase after the operation in icu as well as after 24 hours in the icu .    3.5964033712423786
the perioperative administration of the calcium UNK blocker dil reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during cabg surgery .    3.2745559605811967
this administration during cabg surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding .    3.4219515692715294
as compared to ntg , dil does not have negative effects on hb and th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the icu after cabg surgery .    3.2487302253043553
depression and fibromyalgia ( fm ) share common symptoms , indicating a close relationship between both disorders .    2.849813314734149
fm patients frequently present symptoms of major depression .    3.6044437291600824
genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component .    3.418231884687594
molecular genetic studies are on the way ; the serotonin UNK promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and fm .    3.2167855509760086
biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders .    3.367773180043808
this view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants .    3.567198623543417
at our hospital , closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation .    3.527323803776207
indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries , neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries .    3.382209419396857
during a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy .    3.5386762783369408
of these patients , 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions .    2.853345789031837
in 95 patients follow - ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months .    3.6556075752274415
in more than 75 % of cases good or excellent functional results were documented ; unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions .    3.9875900829762054
nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy .    3.8785498660459488
the present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding ( pet ) in the UNK and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation .    3.704689402922506
in a series of UNK autopsies the over all occurrence of pet was 13 . 3 % .    2.9016715703329568
the highest frequencies were found in fire victims ( 31 % ) , persons who had died after intensive care ( 24 % ) , cardiac death ( 22 % ) , drowning and intoxication ( 16 % each ) .    3.910788368780546
the frequency of pet decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass .    3.4890504527883826
at first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) seemed to influence the occurrence of pet , because the rate was 11 % without and 19 % with cpr ( UNK : p < 0 . 05 ) ; an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature .    3.222456232536738
however , further analysis showed that a higher rate of pet could only be observed in causes of death where pet are often UNK irrespective of cpr , whereas in the other groups pet ( with or without cpr ) are uncommon .    3.709187936187205
furthermore , a case - by - case analysis showed that in several cases with pet after cpr the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than cpr .    3.230424006399881
in a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths ( 181 cases ) , the influence of age and body mass on the rate of pet was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent pet with increasing heart weight .    3.6962690739646815
on the other hand , no statistically significant influence of cpr on the rate of pet could be found in this relatively homogeneous group .    3.0210109547246833
media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the european UNK has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate .    3.534738911887078
although objective data is lacking , the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in germany , austria , the southern UNK , switzerland and the UNK region in france were analysed with respect to the fatal and non - fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997 .    3.65880044845537
because of varying definitions of " mountain accident " used in these countries , available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable .    3.373217181052424
clinically , the tumors were UNK and UNK .    2.965589673038384
mr imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs .    2.901619053281357
at surgery , the tumors were thought to be malignant , most likely liposarcomas .    3.805094792076949
the histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle - shaped fibroblasts , which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers .    2.932071591547809
elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft - tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women .    3.355930424143446
in 10 % of the patients bilateral , often asynchronous tumors are seen .    3.5787907066733173
ninety - nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region .    3.424970229699878
occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities , head , and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities .    4.665197808735375
the relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies .    3.217856976035764
only case reports of one or more patients exist .    3.7525489384526276
optimal therapy , therefore , remains controversial , and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given .    3.4494457715185938
nevertheless , in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred , if no contraindications exist .    3.0907813756911167
two cases are presented together with a literature review .    3.2399374305639803
the UNK - UNK syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease .    3.2723017162924903
a 23 - year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis UNK circumflexa , UNK UNK with UNK hairs of up to 12 cm length and atopic diathesis .    3.7288864160958775
nevertheless , more than 20 years passed before the final diagnosis was established .    3.3687454514543425
in addition , the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis , minimal UNK and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion , more severe than previously reported .    3.245515898546233
oral therapy with acitretin was quite successful .    3.2996308174626257
background : recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes .    4.0758364209637366
autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing .    2.8969822214637486
in vitro fertilisation ivf and UNK sperm injection icsi are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction .    3.0501767815305767
whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted , for example severe UNK damage which cannot be UNK repaired , UNK , severe UNK syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal ivf , icsi might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well .    3.437529036240761
in this paper a number of additional icsi indications are defined , for example minor forms of andrological UNK , UNK of UNK oocytes on the day after conventional ivf , reduced motility of UNK UNK , reduced quality of oocytes or icsi after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in ivf .    3.7422504945048263
load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation .    3.5789463660971754
the loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot .    3.235492296624912
this stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury .    3.961954797273609
however , a certain amount of loading is necessary to improve strength and structure of biological materials .    2.98379040565102
in the past , the development of shoe and surface materials has hardly been perceived under this aspect , but may be increasingly important in the future .    3.199075624548514
with optimal clinical management of patients with marfan syndrome , life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span .    3.6132158834134263
cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling , life - style management , and cardiovascular surveillance , which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis .    3.252564999577048
prophylactic use of beta - blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized .    3.73655322246284
juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with marfan syndrome pose particular problems .    3.657337592387485
this review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on UNK evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies .    3.215363342376427
finally , a review of the most recent advantages to somatic gene therapy is given .    3.7555370811299453
in different animal investigations pyrost demonstrated osteoconductive and UNK effects .    2.9568659182967174
in ectopic tissues and especially in conditions of low UNK potency , the combination of pyrost and autogenic bone marrow effects bone formation .    3.3602218827754906
in germany , good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed .    3.0623057492962134
good UNK industry - sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new ( expensive ) drugs .    2.998232785778109
the preconditions for co - operation in conducting industry - independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in germany by instituting the working group of co - operating arthritis centers , the so - called core documentation where UNK patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ( " rheumanet " ) .    3.166266922038343
the executive board of the german rheumatology association has set up an " ad hoc commission " that agreed to institute a " committee for the coordination of clinical studies in rheumatic diseases " .    2.9505707372273857
in this committee rheumatologists UNK from medicine , orthopedic , pediatrics working in universities , hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented .    3.0792409863870125
in principle this committee is independent of the co - operating arthritis centers and the rheumanet .    2.942091231116741
all members of the german rheumatology association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies .    2.9883265956011726
the committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and UNK multicenter studies to answer these questions .    3.038007520041568
in addition , study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance , quality , and feasibility .    2.9500845724059306
nearly 70 % of patients ' visits to the gynecologist in the peri - and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding .    3.614983979498815
according to the " speed " - hypothesis of cognitive development , the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence .    2.7522353294682516
the present study investigates the " speed " - hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using latent growth curve methodology .    2.610066297224029
date on 4 measurement points come from the bonn longitudinal study of aging ( n = 128 , mean age 67 . 2 , 53 % women ) .    3.4464196531756772
based on principal factor analysis , markers of mental speed were the wais digit symbol test and simple psychomotor task .    2.833091728362338
as indicators of fluid intelligence the wais object assembly and block design were used .    2.9314466534681762
UNK this result , contrary to the " speed " - hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed .    2.8696785914789023
for patients with dilative cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) , the prognosis is highly unfavorable , even under conditions of optimal medication .    3.430272361928031
at present , there is no option for causal therapy .    3.4546216939679604
since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies , e . g . , against 1 ad - UNK or UNK receptors , are involved in the pathogenesis of dcm , the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest .    3.3294983651155157
in addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process , discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism .    3.294369206955853
the effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for dcm patients UNK light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome .    3.0119857017333866
the principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns , to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked .    3.0457755483389786
a pilot study conducted among dcm patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement .    3.199858663527332
these results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in dcm and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept .    2.7885537391267436
active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients , and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy .    3.3204900836160065
gene therapy includes the transfer of genetic material performed by either viral or non - viral methods and in vivo or ex vivo .    3.3598049635709577
for melanoma the following approaches are suggested : vaccination with tumour - specific , hla - associated antigens using peptides or ` naked dna ' , vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or UNK , UNK immunotherapy with specific t - lymphocytes or transfected tumour - infiltrating lymphocytes , or UNK of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma .    3.1839515476569544
since 1995 , a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment .    3.349131245245259
after the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment .    3.71331260474344
the mean follow - up period for all patients was 31 months ( range 3 - 50 months .    3.2419880703291084
in 87 cases ( 75 . 7 % ) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms .    3.79684129604143
apart from low - grade local reactions ( swelling , haematoma , UNK ) no complications were observed .    3.675547954906041
the treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology .    3.0548302035285655
extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing .    3.686332717779155
the sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis ( comep ) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions .    3.2867008567516307
this system uses a mechanical middle ear model ( mmm ) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear .    2.5374663231077745
the implants were fitted under defined conditions into the mmm .    3.029460131876468
displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the mmm was measured with an optical probe .    3.402646066493314
the measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission .    3.7013160433622008
the UNK implant ( 4 mg , titanium ) showed the best results .    3.3618091809181307
the comep revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane .    3.6451213533372995
these findings show that the comep is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range .    3.2276052554884123
in a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the mmm with different forces .    3.503576641998134
the increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity .    3.060642624762715
hence , the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range .    3.357265556310978
UNK are UNK that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis ( m . UNK - pringle ) .    3.412456839406588
clinically , this long - term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass .    3.589864332058456
due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type , computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures .    3.2677865610037102
in view of two of our own case reports , the therapeutic strategies are discussed , paying regard to the actual literature in this field .    4.041304618134827
the UNK pathogenesis of UNK ' s disease ( pd ) is still unknown .    3.06383479086602
histopathological investigations suggest , that the metabolism of the UNK tissue plays an important role .    4.318897749423269
therefore , we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with pd and 11 healthy controls .    3.503028881111615
we UNK biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood , UNK correspond to the collagen metabolism ( UNK iii [ p iii p ] , pmn - UNK [ pmn - e ] , fibronectin [ fn ] , UNK [ fn - r ] und - 1 - proteinase - inhibitor [ - 1 - pi ] ) .    3.0123607965481916
there was no difference in penile and venous blood as well .    2.585268443695578
closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare .    3.5508656777745764
fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature , perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor .    3.82512247510275
most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre - existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections .    3.5704265869853082
clinically , the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without UNK , swelling or neurological signs .    3.1887177033699707
differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded .    3.117282717825851
the clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination .    2.911317271466564
an operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury .    3.342185025415409
preferred procedures are end - to - end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon , followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively .    3.4023087597443773
high - risk patients can be treated conservatively , but the functional results are less satisfactory .    4.414991994492299
we describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon .    3.307791199244368
a yet UNK method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented .    3.329918977958498
in this four - part review article , an update of psychological UNK since 1988 in german speaking countries is given .    2.9766663874278594
part ii of this review focuses an personality development in old age .    3.5587683948159126
in accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development , concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping , psychological UNK and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review ( contributions to basic research ) .    3.1608050547041144
first , research based on the two - process - model of coping , the personality theory of UNK and the life - span theory of control is summarized .    3.8860105339435007
next , work on subjective well - being , self and self - regulation are highlighted .    3.1418166107704915
in the second part of the review ( contribution to applied research ) , an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given .    3.1406029309147834
background : according to literature , 30 - 60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( paf ) .    3.3265048708053535
as rapid tracking of paf may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers , refined algorithms providing av synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during paf are highly desirable .    3.129658492303169
aim and method : this comprehensive paper introduces a new mode switching ( ms ) algorithm which uses either a fixed ( UNK ) or programmable ( UNK ) number of short intervals out of 8 consecutive atrial intervals to detect paf .    3.3960600367000837
if the ms criterion is fulfilled , a switch from av synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed .    2.6216488093051185
the algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the ms sensitivity and specificity .    3.1173985830477653
results : this ms concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards paf of the " mode conversion " in UNK and UNK pacemaker systems , preventing a long time delay between onset of paf , detection of the arrhythmia , and switch to nontracking mode .    3.5270573504943075
in addition , UNK sensing and short UNK periods in the new ms concept enable reliable ms .    2.7149402471951727
the occurrence of atrial UNK should be tested , as it may lead to inappropriate ms . UNK of the ms algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients ' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance , but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations .    4.127523681655918
finally , examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess ms reliability , identify possible problems , and optimize ms function during follow - up .    2.9579428987285246
purpose : to evaluate mr imaging at 1 . 5 tesla in patients suffering from acute subarachnoid hemorrhage ( UNK ) using proton - density weighted ( UNK ) fast spin echo ( UNK ) and fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( flair ) sequences .    3.633597607603389
a number of infectious agents has been newly detected in the last 10 years .    3.331445541312843
UNK UNK and migration have been the most important factors in the emergence of new and old infections .    3.812028719153827
additionally , new methods for the detection of dna and rna have played an important role in the detection of agents difficult to culture .    3.4385505519050246
so far medical requirements for UNK have been defined by national licensing authorities .    3.2877056735831998
for a long while ophthalmological problems , insufficiencies in vision , refraction or color vision , have been responsible for approximately 50 % of rejection of applicants for medical reasons .    3.1137402464477533
introduction : coronary UNK disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world .    3.2648276354283734
although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography ( UNK ) is beyond UNK , the associated risk of an invasive approach , the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non - invasive techniques for coronary imaging .    4.001040771810926
intravenous coronary angiography ( ica ) has been shown to permit non - invasive imaging of the coronary arteries .    3.4220492480225935
we report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders .    3.1293647218857195
the somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology , or it occurred in addition to a well - known psychiatric disorder .    3.673457722484791
for general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders .    3.2156652388517304
if patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health , there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity .    3.771260327828275
penetrating neck injuries are potentially life - threatening injuries .    3.4338414138125217
management is controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature .    2.981924076014887
in the department of trauma surgery of vienna medical school , mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced .    2.921034638047483
thirty - one patients with this kind of injury were treated between august 1992 and september 1999 .    2.9487977237123544
injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots , in eight cases by broken glass , in one case by an iron rod , in one case by a UNK , in one case by a branch and in 13 cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by UNK .    3.5038746346473344
complications like pseudoaneurysms and fistulas were not seen .    3.2398432280332012
no patient came to death .    2.973096108252139
during a 18 - year - period 93 patients ( f = 76 , m = 17 ) with a factitious disorder were identified in the psychiatric consultation service of a university hospital ( incidence : 0 . 62 % ) .    3.341526281504278
50 % of women were working in medical professions whereas only 6 % of men .    3.6933682622001123
chronic courses of illness were prevailing , but at least one quarter of female patients showed an intermittent type .    3.6126264445495457
there was a classical UNK syndrome in 11 % of patients .    3.3212484116888534
depressive and anxiety disorders ( 10 % , 4 % ) were to be respected as psychiatric comorbidity .    4.316820689021463
ca 25 % of the patients suffered from a somatic illness in addition to the factitious disorder , and one third of the women had symptoms of psychosomatic , especially of eating disorders .    4.07879332196636
previous UNK disorders , deliberate self harm and attempts of suicide were to be noted in the psychiatric history of many patients .    3.294281281414015
there were frequent traumatizing events ( UNK home , disturbing family UNK , physical and sexual abuse , early losses , serious illnesses ) in the early biography .    3.291485681777786
various psychosocial stressors could be identified in the actual eliciting situation .    3.630500074028813
the results are discussed in respect of epidemiology , development and clinical phenomenology of factitious disorders , psychodynamics and psychopathology of UNK and self harm , and therapeutic options in the psychiatric consultation service .    3.1833108246219313
in a long - term follow - up we evaluated 40 patients out of 55 ( 73 % ) with a subtalar fusion .    3.290068166114481
the operations took place from 5 / 84 to 5 / 91 .    3.043155556299285
in all cases the indication for the fusion was a post - traumatic arthritis after an intra - articular os calcis fracture .    3.3337417989344393
the evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems : a .    3.8649699807079694
the outcome - questionnaire , rating patient ' s complaints and the functional status based on the severity - symptom scale and functional status described for UNK - syndrome by UNK et al .    3.837256678683043
c . the clinical rating system ( UNK ) described by kitaoka et al .    3.670994209957695
the statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance ( anova ) .    2.649673365163866
level of significance was based on p = 0 . 05 and calculation of UNK ' s correlation coefficient .    4.588306957587267
the os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients ( 33 males and 7 females ) .    3.286018804558935
the primary treatment of the calcaneal fracture was conservative ( cons . )    3.1816780046777633
using a plaster in 23 patients ( 57 . 5 % ) , while 17 patients ( 42 . 5 % ) underwent open reduction and plate fixation ( op . ) .    3.504355922500851
the interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3 . 5 years ( 3 months to 20 years ) .    3.3810967625934394
the interval between subtalar fusion and follow - up averaged 5 . 2 years ( 4 - 14 years ) .    3.6528635422483675
the mean age at the time of UNK was 47 years ( 26 - 61 years ) .    2.915077892959375
in the present study , complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 ( 52 . 5 % ; 58 % op . , 50 % cons . )    3.137739638763923
a relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 ( 65 % ; 76 % op . , 58 % cons . ) .    3.381009236698543
in 23 patients ( 62 % ; 65 % op . , 59 % cons . )    2.954325747773617
the radiological evaluation revealed a grade 1 ° arthritis of the ankle joint , in the UNK joint in 17 patients ( 42 . 5 % ; 41 % op . , 45 % cons .    3.8641420916366176
) , and in the UNK - cuboid joint in 14 patients ( 35 % ; 47 % . , 27 % cons . ) .    4.278923237564544
the statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group , although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types .    4.2991858611369524
in all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical - radiological scoring systems .    3.2415000890545835
for the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation .    3.0419311138779923
objectives correction of an UNK fifth toe .    3.4306735880543697
non - palpable breast - lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis .    2.9075214460720464
accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since UNK UNK of al localization wire is often UNK .    3.5281651328176724
the consequences are larger tissue - defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result .    3.116889670087499
nevertheless , resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete .    3.129619398046666
digital mammography coupled with stereotactic biopsy procedures gives more accurate results with minimal invasive techniques .    2.9603759699692977
either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of the methods .    3.9550454562542674
chondroid syringoma belongs to the group of so - called mixed tumors , like pleomorphic adenomas of the lacrimal and salivary glands .    3.4677073089726203
the histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed , in particular with respect to its stromal component .    4.08716902846581
the distribution of cytokeratins ( cks ) , cea , ema , vimentin , s - 100 protein , desmin and actin [ - smooth muscle actin ( - sma ) ] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type .    2.5672141528804073
the UNK cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of cks ( kl1 and mnf116 ) , cea and ema , while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin , s - 100 was expressed to a lesser extent and kl1 , weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of mnf116 .    2.8079095402849346
whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin , s - 100 protein , mnf116 markedly and kl1 weakly , the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin , s - 100 protein and , focally , cks and - sma .    2.472977661958477
anti - sma specifically detects myoepithelial cells .    2.9856820883600492
in addition , the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments , membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma .    2.6445257386485963
leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases .    3.374624437543716
most frequently , they are due to UNK , to a lesser extent to metabolic , neuropathic or hematologic diseases .    3.7002888619460057
neoplasms , connective tissue diseases , infections , trauma , and UNK should also be included in the differential diagnosis .    3.9195911401524954
a 38 - year - old caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers .    2.9231881070155996
the ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments .    3.516886193500538
additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation , short stature , extensive dental caries , and multiple UNK UNK .    2.840726340705201
hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease .    3.487929445783637
it is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism .    2.806456967125404
ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis .    3.099038140350969
so far , there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency .    3.1078195386206593
all reported treatment attempts have ended in failure .    2.977169935085942
in this paper the basic features of acute , subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis , skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described .    2.804354481969909
the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms , culture studies , laboratory studies and radiological signs .    3.0903428493766945
the common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed .    2.9909284802740457
in the treatment of post - traumatic / postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of UNK strains .    3.723201167147852
thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics , a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed .    3.4037321574184536
despite this improved prognosis , an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon .    3.26369074131586
besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis , treatment , and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics , the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus .    3.237380690605115
thus , physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics .    3.3731025298040405
today , in the light of european integration , the medical profession ' s and state ' s obligations are challenged in different ways .    3.2497617161691377
whereas the german medical association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the UNK framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine , i . e . , in the areas of inheritance law , adoption law , family law , and law of succession , the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs . social UNK in heterologous insemination .    2.9344770164465106
in crohn ' s disease , some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis , subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following UNK of vitamin b12 or folic acid , UNK neuropathy , and polyneuropathy have been described .    3.0230869399118236
cerebral vasculitis secondary to crohn ' s disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon .    3.6966565399068685
we report on three such cases in three female patients ( aged 26 , 29 , and 61 years ) .    2.779179487044265
all patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis ; one complained additionally of a speech disorder , headache , and intermittent loss of orientation .    2.771644577016657
in ct and mri scans , multiple lesions were detected ; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle - and large - sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis .    3.111913882421296
serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time .    3.062056770863153
under anticoagulation ( in two cases ) and immunosuppressive therapy , neurologic symptoms disappeared .    3.549778790048388
in the following 6 to 12 months , no new neurological symptoms appeared .    3.4755827907113885
in two cases , doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and , in one case , progressive intracranial stenoses .    3.192386109455733
the UNK protease tryptase ( UNK .    3.0542107108145804
3 . 4 . 21 . 59 ) , which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells , is released by mast cell degranulation in an UNK active form together with other mediators , e . g .    3.1391505825466752
histamine , into the extracellular space and the circulation .    3.318832118862236
the capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to UNK polypeptide hormones and to activate pro - enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue - remodeling processes .    3.0788410515582125
therefore , in the skin , a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions , but also in other inflammatory diseases , degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing , where an accumulation and / or activation of mast cells is found .    3.6625715612240555
its absence during histamine - UNK reactions may suggest UNK activation .    3.0200502879153173
in addition , tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues .    3.2223050111846088
background : since the development of lacrimal UNK with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly , the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively .    3.732395003763544
flexible UNK can be combined with a laser for the first time , allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy .    4.026326259537668
surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement ( ao classification 41 a1 , b1 - b3 and c1 - c3 ) makes high demands on traumatological management .    2.6342424391578154
by using modern , minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta - articular fractures , it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result .    3.354983379998171
the aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures .    3.0290634506962597
arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma , but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation , as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra - articular injuries , a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods .    3.7666026298440918
from a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures , arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from september 1994 to january 1998 .    3.3780045898185223
the follow - up of a total of 17 patients revealed good UNK when assayed by means of the lysholm and UNK score .    3.5119264942371955
we suggest that arthroscopically assisted , minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of ao classification 41 c1 - c3 fractures .    3.3265711136950493
dorsal tension band fixation is a wide - spread technique of finger arthrodesis .    3.3594386183090914
when using a resorbable pds - suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed .    2.805709342249136
aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup - in - cone - procedure .    4.027569813386872
from 6 degrees onwards the wire - tension - system requires a higher torque for bending , but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture .    3.330192800953624
the examination shows that the thread - tension - band method by pds - loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces .    2.873021516802161
modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments .    2.9413925532284018
one recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation .    3.4783291701594985
at the same time , serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the UNK body .    3.490586727614198
one major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain - dead person as dead .    3.0171865286371955
the presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post - mortem organ donation , because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs , other than the brain , remain viable .    3.2299403856598565
the objection implies scepticism as to the physician ' s ability to distinguish a dead from a living person .    3.190301762461068
on the other hand , even the critics must rely on the physician ' s ability to discriminate , e . g . , when to discontinue resuscitation .    2.7430573769158952
the medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation .    3.215394380103757
it must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for UNK organ donation .    2.7309566780661805
one ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation .    3.404596564927181
the UNK of the treatment is not the donor , but another person , the recipient .    3.9988957767750914
although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense , even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person , the life - interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate .    3.501794543206102
the resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life - interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor ' s consent as far as possible .    2.690024504894596
the proposed information model seems adequate at the moment .    3.336929102906796
a common report of both UNK in germany in 1990 supported postmortem organ transplantation .    3.3173527292861453
the report dealt with the medical problems and UNK them with the christian value of solidarity .    3.292323842821106
the ethical alternatives to organ transplantation , however , are not mentioned .    3.687083544748628
within this limitation , the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and UNK for fair perception of the UNK ' s life - interest .    3.775087097271899
starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly , as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport .    3.647126048232154
elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour .    2.885151853859776
driver assistance systems , just available or soon on the market , are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers .    3.271312771267083
an expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are : emergency systems , enhanced vision systems and parking aids .    3.3489219675628874
emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver ' s request , and direct them to the emergency location .    3.215454023229944
self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve UNK and automatic dipping .    3.259581877200763
parking aids , using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with UNK problems .    3.1139685747712655
the group of helpful , but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car , comprising autonomous UNK control , UNK systems and electronic stability programmes .    3.2858878088129906
the value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory .    3.35648470070225
reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems , helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without UNK problems .    2.715677411805294
the article demonstrates the particular importance of specific UNK of the man - machine - interface for elderly , to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic .    3.3978016255071597
drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double - blind , placebo - controlled randomized studies .    3.1126475678986454
the results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .    3.308388043571767
in addition , antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility .    3.251394581741682
inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e . g . , with UNK , tamoxifen , UNK , UNK , mast cell blockers , UNK , vitamin e , UNK , alpha receptor blockers , glutathione , UNK , interferon alpha , growth hormone , zinc salts , ketoprofen , UNK or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement .    4.0875651107219415
recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure fsh , while gnrh and fsh have no influence on UNK in UNK men .    3.274542027607601
in 40 patients with alzheimer ' s disease ( ad ) , in 5 patients with non - ad dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) .    3.3269897193302014
of the ad patients , 19 were very mildly demented ( UNK score from 25 to 28 ) .    3.090575206535733
even in these patients , csf tau was significantly more elevated than in controls .    3.2131729660507684
in the non - ad patients protein tau was less increased .    3.362006027904435
among the ad patients there was no association between csf tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow , determined by spect .    3.4069681042538145
our findings suggest that csf tau may be elevated even at the UNK stage of ad and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease .    3.358197502771399
the aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti - ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease .    2.840608477799982
the accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored .    2.9883656344762746
one in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease .    2.6413135438879713
of these patients , it is estimated that 20 % - 40 % have perioperative myocardial ischaemia ( pmi ) , the majority being UNK .    4.203393424455635
the anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae .    3.614990654417447
this can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of UNK drugs .    3.2993619163298815
UNK ( nitrates , UNK ) serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment .    3.581804916317221
acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators , they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia .    3.440215034197778
beta - blockers reduce the rate of pmi to a greater extent than nitrates .    3.861992717862886
they are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate .    3.160404853849122
consequently , such one - time medication can be considered for previously untreated high - risk patients presenting for surgery .    3.467943452243719
intra - operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group .    3.0169874011937234
in addition to nitrates , calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm .    3.0266379886605925
drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease , however , they also cause increased perioperative bleeding .    3.8630253161059414
consequently , it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery , with the exception of high - risk patients .    3.439342513620275
pilot studies using alpha2 - agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in pmi .    3.4593074850903864
the perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated .    3.25987182795996
current anti - UNK medications , with the exception of anti - platelet agents , should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter .    3.7842384170798473
all of these drugs except anti - platelet agents may also be used intra - operatively , however , possible interactions with anaesthetic agents should be carefully considered .    3.6057661791395055
inflammatory bowel diseases ( crohn ' s disease , ulcerative colitis ) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders .    2.6750350548547948
however , this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers .    2.973290012986735
at the same time , biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) .    3.314005193047667
in the present paper , the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of ibd is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective .    3.122612948836666
among biomedical factors , a genetically based pathological immune reaction is highly probable .    3.1543719993821244
however , the findings of immunological disturbances are of a more descriptive nature and seem to explain not the UNK process of the development of the disease , but rather a kind of disposition .    3.811217950679604
the question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation .    3.04939778767296
interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho - neuro - immunological research in this area .    2.8809978591206957
results of research on psychological pathology ( psychiatric disorders , personality factors ) are inconclusive .    3.1846627632137534
in particular , some modern , well - controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature .    3.479520836967818
part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects .    4.108876053437221
research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results .    3.419818571088337
prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross - sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations .    3.273424144514218
however , coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease .    2.7763143122813223
finally , perspectives for future research are suggested .    2.8820509610891185
genital infection , particularly bacterial UNK ( UNK ) , increases the relative risk of prematurity .    3.754444212583088
detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable UNK such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate .    3.524921333417403
a pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition .    3.686339259884576
we report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole .    2.9597332604474538
the pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the UNK week of gestation with marked UNK .    3.6892275529554164
the non - molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of UNK UNK resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus .    3.540039108224753
no malignancy occured post partum .    3.185704564706019
the clinical and pathogenetic aspects of this rare entity are discussed .    3.573443682687793
these models seem problematic , since neither the patients ' histories nor the macroscopic - radiographical or histological appearances can be UNK with them .    3.3838122977182032
evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the department of orthopaedics at the university hospital in heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition .    3.5333307834685863
x - ray material , core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available .    3.7368120216137792
a stage - by - stage progression emerged , which initially caused alterations only in the mr image , while the x - ray picture remained unremarkable .    3.68308788433456
it was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it .    3.5483297650384125
this meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone .    3.265651009282218
the spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage - related classification for lunate bone necrosis .    3.5404595819565006
the pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight , while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist .    2.9721116207094935
the position - dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in UNK .    3.4232171600803336
the pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones ; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure .    3.1666504047510435
it was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically UNK on movement .    2.68883495231938
the anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally .    3.0369749197197606
after staining of both the arteries and the veins , UNK sheet UNK was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the UNK position and six in extension .    3.8072911277077264
visualization of the vessels showed that capsular - ligamentous structures that were UNK on the palmar side and UNK turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries , but substantially hindered venous drainage .    3.41813136412278
the anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented ; this explained the pronounced pressure increases .    2.952145444931373
the unphysiological position of the base of the radius UNK in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis .    4.007448837275445
evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation , while manual work had an important role .    3.6209702328995323
most manual UNK are performed with the wrist in extension .    3.6604409198585803
any extension UNK triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk .    3.0334473310744343
thus , our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist , which is initially physiological , before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course .    3.2745395738866714
the morbidity was assessed using a self - administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician .    3.4287327232799947
the agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than 90 % for allergic rhinitis , food allergy and urticaria and about 80 % for contact dermatitis and asthma .    3.317061071672449
the results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between east and west germany .    2.6169383564334803
using the interview data 17 % of the west but only 11 % of the east german adults have / had e . g .    3.5452949300566217
comparable differences exist for contact dermatitis .    3.241386218516995
many people with allergies suffer or have suffered from several allergies .    2.9648026004997714
frequent patterns of combination are food allergy / allergic rhinitis and asthma / allergic rhinitis .    2.8922936595231463
in comparison with former studies we observed an increase of 70 % in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis between 1990 / 92 and 1998 .    3.654727949355184
the relative increase is higher in east than in west .    3.025701566065455
the time trend in prevalence of asthma could only be calculated for the west german population .    2.89781550791447
the results show a remarkable increase here , too .    2.655619141866653
case report on a 72 year old female patient presenting with collapse and progressive dyspnea .    3.6734789971871145
x - ray of the chest showed a marked enlargement of the heart extending to the right .    4.213492892896626
echocardiography revealed an impressive displacement of the heart chambers to the left caused by a large aneurysm ( UNK cm ) located anteriorly and medially from the right heart communicating with the right atrium .    3.674587913310726
pronounced compression of the basal part of the right ventricle was present .    4.893274006792186
within the aneurysmatic cavity several highly mobile thrombi and extensive spontaneous echo contrast were demonstrated .    2.706625909629063
coronary angiography revealed a marked curved displacement of the right coronary artery to the left side .    3.8398821276910224
perfusion lung scanning suggested bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism proven by digital UNK angiography .    2.928301419336972
with long - term oral anticoagulation the patient remained symptomfree during follow - up of now more than four years .    3.53904751995617
icd - 10 was implemented for morbidity coding in germany in january 2000 .    3.0225761467963688
the electronic versions of icd - 10 are introduced .    3.316473825397937
for everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by dimdi : icd - 10 meta files , icd conversion tables , icd - 10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms .    1.7006367245300695
all files are available free of charge via the internet .    1.965083757939142
hair is regarded as a product of the skin and cutaneous UNK .    3.623242818448885
possible influences of skin functions such as resorption , excretion and as a temporary reservoir for drug substances on hair analysis is discussed .    2.964363475775129
the relevance of skin secretions and their interactions with UNK hair fibers is outlined .    2.9758866182119643
for the emergency treatment of sustained , hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia , antiarrhythmic drugs are the therapy of choice .    3.165024960071908
mostly class i antiarrhythmic drugs , such as UNK or UNK , are preferred .    3.967268429666563
in hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia , electrical cardioversion should be applied , in case of recurrences , followed by UNK treatment with class i antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone .    3.552160884762622
for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death , - blockers and / or amiodarone are the only effective drugs .    3.6388875519559294
in the secondary prevention , only the implantable cardioverter / defibrillator has proved to improve the prognosis of the patients .    3.6543529322621278
insular carcinoma of the thyroid is a low differentiated type UNK about 5 % of all thyroid cancers .    4.6947293702953115
higher aggressiveness has been suggested as an important clinical feature .    3.974952155015611
the value of preoperative fine - needle aspiration biopsy is not clearly proven for insular carcinoma .    2.6240940284063803
the criteria for histological diagnosis have been outlined by UNK et al .    2.768323823301434
because of its aggressiveness , radical treatment at primary surgery appears advisable .    2.9093910432158143
its clear distinction from undifferentiated ( anaplastic ) and medullary ( c cell ) cancers is important , as UNK is regularly synthesized by cancer cells .    2.901415631165475
UNK of radioactive iodine makes such treatment feasible postoperatively and at relapse .    2.816892519428298
follow - up should be performed as in highly differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid cancer .    3.3335464063660596
a patient series of eight cases is presented .    2.9995866548837338
while all cancers were advanced at the initial diagnosis , the observed disease courses were in agreement with the assumption that insular carcinoma is a more aggressive form of differentiated thyroid cancer .    3.0618343093576965
the result of an investigation of 128 from UNK ( 45 , 2 % ) medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of hannover is presented .    3.617510505567848
the aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy .    3.1722520822602274
besides we found gender , school of psychotherapy and professional experience as factor influencing the patients waiting time for beginning a psychotherapy .    2.9734670191849917
in contrast to other studies , the number of medical and psychological psychotherapists is not different , nevertheless the psychotherapeutical care in hannover is not ensured .    3.2212048201356454
objectives reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in children without creating permanent damage to the tibial or femoral UNK .    3.5742095193499006
the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the UNK coronary anomalies which often remains asymptomatic until the patients achieve advanced age but may also be clinically manifest already in infants and lead to sudden death .    3.6967828259446947
we report the diagnostics and surgical treatment in a 15 - month - old asymptomatic child and the necessity of surgical repair .    3.4743546590214476
the diagnosis was incidentally made during an echocardiographic procedure and confirmed by coronary angiography .    2.954362320228246
a reimplantation of the UNK origin of the coronary artery was carried out UNK using extra - UNK circulation .    4.659417107031822
there were no postoperative complications .    2.436905123319587
due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk , surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases .    3.194027290424949
the surgical management of UNK fistulae ( vvf ) is a matter of controversy .    3.0875587459391505
this study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from vvf .    3.6647610145408067
between 1966 and 1996 , 64 patients with vvf were treated surgically .    3.4067417016108705
the vvf occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients , was due to radiotherapy in 7 , was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients , and occurred after UNK in 1 patient .    4.310047557661519
in 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally .    3.5379925403022914
fourteen of these 60 patients ( 23 % ) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the vvf ( 1 to 3 procedures ) .    3.401741447527856
transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients ( 92 % ) .    2.912231120641606
the other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure ( again transvaginal : n = 3 ; transabdominal : n = 2 ) .    3.3036300579698397
in conclusion , the transvaginal approach to close vvf is of advantage , avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity .    2.647187994634914
in the vast majority of the cases isolated vvf can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair .    3.660716152870526
myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle , brain , heart , eyes , and endocrine organs .    3.1541685137892843
the underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide ctg repeat in the 3 ' prime UNK region of a UNK - UNK kinase gene on chromosome UNK .    3.3365940825908096
a statistical correlation exists between the ctg copy number and the severity of the disease .    2.965356210916937
infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the ctg repeat than is seen in the non - congenital myotonic dystrophy population .    3.595761432095013
however , not all patients with many ctg UNK develop congenital myotonic dystrophy .    3.0345381755065874
we present 13 patients with more than 1500 ctg trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course .    3.0192878769630904
whilst the incidence of psychiatric disorders decreases during pregnancy , the risk during the postpartum period increases significantly , often leading to the necessity of psychopharmacological intervention during the puerperium , and subsequently during UNK and breast - feeding .    3.55273269377699
objectives arthrodesis of the chopart joint .    3.398911828163167
should a malalignment exist , it must be corrected prior to fusion .    3.273525085521857
elimination of painful functional disturbances and reduced need for custom - made shoes .    3.2238267158556253
in 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis ( % - ds ) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography ( dqca ) by use of an on - line computer workstation .    3.0392658732752738
the decision for coronary angioplasty in the same setting ( " prima vista " - ptca ) was based on history , evidence of ischemia and visual estimation of % - ds .    3.167946496504142
dqca measurements of the 339 stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of 58 . 4 + / - 11 . 3 % .    3.708523664665106
in contrast to dqca visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~ 55 % between two peaks at ~ 45 % and ~ 75 % and a mean of 70 . 5 + / - 19 . 6 % .    3.1024467777455995
visual estimation revealed a % - ds > = 60 % in UNK stenoses ( 74 . 0 % ) of the 339 lesions , an estimate that led to subsequent " prima vista " - ptca .    3.130944190684785
conversely , dqca revealed only 184 stenoses ( 54 . 3 % ) with a % - ds > = 60 % ; thus , 86 stenoses ( 25 . 3 % ) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for ptca .    3.167850500883056
the bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an UNK of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for " self - referral " of patients for ptca .    3.3368936645838825
dqca serves as an objective tool in the decision - making process for ptca and may reduce " cosmetic " interventions or justify to UNK ptca .    3.4306280209291367
especially in the selection process for " prima vista " - ptca dqca - quantification of stenosis severity is recommended .    2.799755558374498
in these circumstances , s - 100 and nse levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests .    3.361884647418633
the present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement .    3.1021757643374124
since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago , propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia .    3.1183471376863916
however the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years .    3.106133452316519
as can be substantiated by many data reported in literature , there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons UNK to withhold propofol from the younger children ; this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions .    3.2433988743556
orthostatic circulatory disorders are frequently the cause of orthostatic intolerance , syncope or dangerous falls .    3.497848376762465
a sufficient therapy should be based on a differential diagnosis by means of an active standing test or a tilt - table test .    3.8541415274185495
three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated .    3.3202640753282946
the hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure ( systolic drop > 20 mmhg below base line within 3 min ) with or without compensatory tachycardia .    3.2939177721142205
it is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction .    2.933743518968024
tachycardia ( > 30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min ) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome .    3.1040122341530623
in general , there is no further somatic dysfunction .    3.4204471862312373
increased venous UNK is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism .    3.8197900426638376
a reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing : sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and UNK activation bradycardia .    2.8246229273651924
proved therapies include use of the UNK UNK ( hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension ) , of the a - agonist UNK ( postural tachycardia syndrome ) and of b - blockers ( neurocardiogenic syncope ) .    3.700180127732142
there are numerous diseases which can irreversibly UNK the whole spine or parts of the axial skeleton .    2.996127262057252
due to UNK reasons one can distinguish 3 UNK of such disorders : - paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent UNK to stiffness .    3.53441471522279
- rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine .    3.044529226949779
modern approaches in knee UNK using computer - assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks .    3.1012173962101914
however , surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone , as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis .    3.644891707795371
functional aspects are of UNK importance .    3.4453139161149835
a 79 - year - old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound - guided prostatic biopsy .    3.3432765259535433
autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the UNK vessels .    4.082768565146119
a similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy - associated complication has not been described previously .    2.961294853081958
the UNK UNK were discontinued .    3.630013171502291
several different theories exist about the UNK of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome , with individual sensitivities differing significantly .    3.4461717483852894
one explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the UNK .    3.4525306127083177
a difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration .    3.8160793850121806
for this reason we measured interindividual UNK in UNK and UNK otolith mass .    3.4082794207673164
since the anatomy of the vestibular organ in UNK is based as similar principles , we selected UNK ( salmon and UNK ) as our study model to UNK preparations .    3.421539231526924
the maximum difference in mass in the UNK was 17 % and was generally smaller in the UNK , although in individual cases was much higher .    4.615447747195237
we assume that a UNK sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place .    3.000953137440026
UNK leads to kinetosis under non - physiological motion patterns .    3.052065434382868
when the vestibular system is better balanced and has an equally distributed otolith mass to both sides , the possibility for developing kinetosis or space adaption syndrome is much less likely .    2.972916668662472
the clinical features , diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis , a rare illness , are described .    3.200691988668493
of clinical note are the pain , UNK and restriction of movement .    4.171572223086941
staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described .    4.086362887476103
sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses ; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis .    3.227641361720369
mr - tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci ( spondylitis , pelvis osteomyelitis ) .    3.4659694988288217
in our view , the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics UNK the most important treatment .    3.6420252425807442
interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis .    3.2977921425675496
little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids ( gc ) .    3.396652406578029
in bone tissue , osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying gc - cytokine interactions .    3.166693262281372
hence , we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines ( saos - 2 and mg - 63 ) with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive il - 6 production ( 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 ( mean + / - se ) and UNK + / - UNK pg / 106 cells ) .    3.9942485593100145
we measured glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of il - 6 .    3.116611920263444
incubation for 20 h with il - 6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg / ml yielded a significant increase of gr binding sites in both cell lines .    3.3262232621078915
il - 6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone ( 1 µmol / l ) on gr in both cell lines .    3.099360377795739
in mg - 63 cells , expressing higher concentrations of gr , il - 6 deprivation via a specific anti - il - 6 antibody ( 100 ng / ml ) significantly decreased gr .    3.0696905295019676
in saos - 2 cells , expressing lower concentrations of gr , a 40 h treatment with human il - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) significantly increased both il - 6 production and gr .    3.243276016241526
this latter effect was completely abolished by co - treating the cells with the anti - il - 6 antibody .    3.0461172827320864
our results provide evidence that il - 6 is an autocrine positive modulator of gr number in human osteoblasts .    3.0573343024431807
tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy .    3.3991006472744054
however , in advanced malignant disease , this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality .    3.3430856140669976
adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed .    3.071054789296622
therefore , long - term survival remains unaffected .    3.4227249325370694
advances in biomedical science provide preliminary explanations for these therapeutic problems .    2.9429319644600467
the probability of complete r0 resections , necessary to improve long - term survival , can be enhanced by these therapies .    3.7105550716393343
the ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging .    2.910591025200481
the simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare .    3.3002988128938666
objective findings are of special interest if it happens .    3.6599301984491803
pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left - hand side and normal hearing on the right - hand side .    3.1669296804019926
however , stapedius reflexes were found UNK left as well as UNK right , at 0 . 5 to 2 khz with a stimulation of UNK 90 db spl .    3.4833833299163524
transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions ( teoae ) and distortion - product otoacoustic emissions ( dpoae ) were measured .    2.668537410812316
the teoae had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides , such that inner ear function could not be evaluated .    3.3274312483499227
in comparison , the dp gram showed clear dp amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides .    2.918658287735665
UNK UNK could be excluded by assessing the dp growth rate at three different frequencies .    3.3966475445416227
by means of brainstem electric response audiometry ( bera ) , with which the iv / v complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 db spl UNK , and the UNK test , a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded .    3.3144240624925314
normal hearing on the left - hand side was thus confirmed .    3.1191741338722103
in cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by dpoae .    3.1359002994102902
controlled studies of adrenal steroids in premenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) have revealed subtle and inconsistent decreases in UNK ( gcs ) function , but prominent deficiencies of adrenal UNK ( aa ) .    2.844134925869633
such findings have suggested that UNK may predispose to ra in younger women .    3.3141384922928854
however , recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and UNK sulfate ( dheas ) levels before ( x = 12 yrs ) the onset of the disease ( pre - ra ) offer an alternative perspective .    3.0172562315674587
significant dissociation of serum cortisol and dheas levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed ra before age 50 .    2.9910526395804036
this subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum dheas levels .    3.0209479112683377
a growing number of UNK and the increasing restrictions of UNK will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery .    4.506296357995449
despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents .    2.911978104268682
therefore the german society for trauma surgery ( UNK ) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes .    3.5849456682461502
this role compromises the engagement in a continuous UNK for the high and global standard of injury care in germany , for quality assessment , education and training , research and adequate public relations .    3.780848963923341
this paper outlines the aspects and UNK of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to UNK international acknowledged standard of trauma care in germany .    3.391330365543998
radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia .    3.3569445585841
electrophysiologic investigations in UNK patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation : ablation of fast ( i ) or slow ( ii ) , modification of fast ( iii ) or slow av nodal pathways ( iv ) , modification of both pathways ( v ) , ablation of fast and modification of slow ( vi ) , ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways ( vii ) and ablation of both pathways ( viii ) .    3.327328163672607
follow - up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation ( 0 - 2 % ) in comparison to patients with modification of a single av nodal pathway ( 8 - 12 % ) .    4.351868105565808
alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total av nodal block , which occured in 7 patients ( 1 . 1 % ) .    3.4673891710528952
detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for av nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow - up or development of total av block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure .    4.222108955649236
an increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70 - 84 years and persons aged 85 years and older .    2.812578584041601
information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare .    4.143858562735455
the berlin aging study was based on a representative age - and gender - stratified sample ( n = 516 ) of berlin UNK aged 70 - 100 years and older .    3.706193239074062
in this interdisciplinary study , an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists , UNK , internists and psychiatrists .    3.588977817309183
this report focuses on subjectively reported complaints ( UNK , bl ) , observed psychopathological symptomatology ( brief psychiatric rating scale , bprs ) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of dsm - iii - r ( based on the geriatric mental state examination , UNK - a ) .    3.1557581592112522
on the self - rating scale ( bl ) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints , 32 % moderate complaints .    3.1750808627266216
on the bprs , 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology , 75 % at least mild symptoms .    2.945974221752657
following the criteria of dsm - iii - r , 23 . 5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease , 4 . 2 % a disease of severe intensity .    3.4729509554070566
when the dsm - iii - r diagnoses " not otherwise specified " ( nos ) were included 40 . 4 % of all subjects were diagnosed by the clinical judgement of the psychiatrists to have a psychiatric disease .    3.245629819880227
the most frequent psychiatric diseases were UNK ( 18 . 8 % ) , depression nos ( 17 . 8 % ) and dementia ( 13 . 8 % ) .    3.69740210241329
dementia showed the well - known age - related increase , whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age - related .    3.6279376691696252
persons aged 70 - 84 years did not differ in the investigated psychiatric variables from persons aged 85 years and older , the only exception being the prevalence of dementia .    3.05269520041814
a first overview concerning UNK risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented .    3.164933029800836
semi - structured interviews of 400 patients were UNK to identify homogeneous groups concerning initial reactions at first manifestations of the disease .    3.32710565784218
four groups ( " isolated " , " stigmatized " , " socially supported " and " non - stigmatized " patients ) were found and cross - UNK with five resulting groups of a second cluster - analysis concerning the " style " of the seeking behaviour of professional and UNK help and medical measures against the psoriasis ( " multi - users " , " arranged mini - users " , " waiting - room patients " , " UNK " and " self - therapists " ) .    3.344465438644576
we were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction .    3.290711168306178
the results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units .    2.6822054337395147
the sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described .    3.5283511748079195
malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform : initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly UNK lesions can be found .    3.156387903429282
generally , four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described : diffuse , small nodular , large nodular and bulky type .    2.846972487361763
secondary , tumor - related or inflammatory complications ( e . g . dislocation or compression of vessels , thoracic inlet syndrome , venous thrombosis , ileus , urinary retention , abscess and effusion ) can be sonographically evaluated .    3.3933693429848995
response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor - related complications .    3.165287487374345
differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and , with certain restrictions , on the UNK of lesions and perfusion feasible with doppler sonography .    3.959925928402892
the primary diagnosis has to be established histologically .    3.6889152475285543
the treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an UNK augmentation .    3.4346915207589146
tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed .    3.117486219946459
for the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft , which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach .    3.44833992506886
in cases of posterolateral instabilities , additional procedures are necessary .    3.0299820804046145
ultrasound of the achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue .    3.2375393797252063
different forms of degenerative disease ( tendinitis , UNK or bursitis , UNK , and UNK ' s disease ) can be UNK from rheumatic and metabolic diseases .    4.491406028530443
congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected .    3.7521154142597086
tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon ( " critical zone " ) .    4.414831752865443
immature tissue in this area leads to UNK instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ( " vulnerable phase " ) .    4.2315397478683145
with sonography , lesions of the achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease .    3.282847109471764
the german social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services .    3.016044752741716
the legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was UNK in the sickness insurance provision ( social code - book v ) only in 1989 .    3.296507647854922
quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and , therefore , is regulated in the context of providing medical services .    3.7369047148361587
the legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment .    3.0436659434724547
due to the variety of medical services , quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner .    3.376215043371543
according to the law , providers of medical services ( doctors , hospitals ) are bound to participate in quality assessment .    3.2320366945264083
as internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment , external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals .    4.141181723010416
because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization , consumers ( patients ) or their representatives are not involved in the definition , establishment , and control of quality assessment .    3.5638804204232764
introduction : because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures , it is important to look into the possibility of UNK these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary .    3.4112486852092805
material and methods : to discuss these aspects , the documented data on tapp operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed .    3.35148702950137
the results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had UNK past the learning and development curve .    2.997357140332801
before starting the first procedure , 89 were done by assistants operating the UNK .    3.223322874351109
the morbidity of teaching operations was 1 . 9 % compared to 1 . 4 % for those performed by experts .    4.524665320236012
after a median follow - up of 23 months there were two recurrences ( 0 . 23 % ) in the expert group and none in the teaching group ( follow - up 16 months ) .    3.769029112494097
conclusion : because of the potentials of standardization of the tapp technique , the results of teaching were equal to expert operations .    3.6572915669303883
therefore , tapp is suitable for application in a routine setting .    3.385704558127995
in spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy , intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure .    3.1311771066885568
this led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years .    3.761667141354848
to minimize the risk of bleeding , we improved the high - frequency technology in several steps .    3.3649690725990427
to achieve this , the output signals of commercially available high - frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality .    3.293252128326806
laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding .    3.9736815956325855
as a result , blood transfusions were less necessary , the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period , and hospitalization time was significantly reduced .    3.0831597307944265
in conclusion , the improved high - frequency technology in form of the " UNK intermittent cutting " results in a blood - sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity .    3.3248642523098595
an accurate assessment of the duration of the ability to act following fatal poisoning can be of major importance in reconstructing circumstances leading to death , especially in determining whether the poisoning was accidental , self - inflicted , or the result of a criminal act .    3.6921065329098086
clinical publications have UNK dealt with this problem .    3.1033789795253295
as a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10 - 15 min .    3.00936334623481
however , the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer .    3.48484868371048
the present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication .    2.961200093802306
androgenablation is the therapy of choice for the treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer .    3.705334853057847
however , in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years .    3.35832659722376
intermittent androgenablation through medical UNK maintains the apoptotic potential .    3.076832719625792
by periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved .    3.9206259309194285
apart from reduced toxicity treatment costs are lowered and tumor progression is possibly delayed .    3.0303139595330766
in how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials .    3.4994162146426198
therefore , the delivered flow pattern during psv might be better UNK with the patient ' s demands than during volume - assisted ventilation .    3.3951058735078745
in several modern ventilators , inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25 % of the initial peak value .    3.198530173464804
however , this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high .    2.8719618402874914
this could result not only in an increased risk of UNK between the patient and the ventilator , but also in reduced ventilatory support .    4.148789712644876
on the other hand , a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient ' s inspiratory effort .    2.8259994278061855
the aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak - flow rate during psv on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing .    2.75597953901975
to date , positron emission tomography ( pet ) is the most powerful tool for the non - invasive study of biochemical processes .    3.1014185377196695
besides its usefulness for basic research pet has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications .    3.321581158867012
however , the introduction of pet into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs .    3.2382730071891674
several american studies lend support to the hypothesis that pet may be more cost - effective than the conventional diagnostic work - up - at least for some of its clinical indications .    3.2837411250042874
in germany , however , this hypothesis has still not been verified .    3.741728503270033
the rapid growth , development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability .    2.978224239754051
it is well known that early nutrition has short term effects ( e . g .    2.4671970152173315
on growth ) , and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy ( e . g .    3.4768946095623647
hypoglycaemia , phenylketonuria ) have long term effects on child development .    3.1308543908980244
more recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range , which occur during sensitive periods of early human development , may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood .    2.9734035302672277
this metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood .    3.3996287199082666
long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant UNK on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus , crohn ' s disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants .    3.3497329576551937
an improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions .    3.529780084298962
already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy .    3.058582191963626
persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases .    3.2541747088059356
an analysis of the reported UNK diseases in germany shows : a large number of cases of UNK fever , UNK fever , UNK infections , UNK and UNK UNK during the last years in germany originated from foreign countries .    3.9384968059515457
intervention measures are necessary , above all , with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine - preventable diseases .    3.5252756729704364
bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3 , 5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our UNK about 800 cases are reported in the literature .    3.467065007299317
an even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non - germ cell tumor .    2.919460123490512
we report the 6th case of such a coincidence .    3.3172538854911733
even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered , if the strict conditions for resection and follow - up are respected .    3.7716740968268057
most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic .    3.292382466673537
only augmentation of case numbers by meta - analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality .    2.995859456882304
however , the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases .    3.6624235290713885
this and specific side effects of amiodarone UNK a general primary prophylaxis with this drug .    3.5481567803106415
an additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta - blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies .    3.218214751783808
at present , primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta - blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations .    3.1740640357198884
as a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at german epilepsy centers of usual pre - and postoperative drug treatment , the following strategy is recommended :    3.389248011627564
an ecological theory of UNK is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment .    3.885339852430672
the specific ecological relationship to the environment is UNK , and also opens access to the UNK of the past .    4.436797593689465
in the present study , conditions for this access ( in particular with older people ) were investigated .    2.997045575248499
it is assumed that older people , especially , when they lose UNK with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment , such as moving to a home , are rejected by older people .    3.162824250340635
these hypotheses were checked on the basis of material ( n = 120 ) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed .    3.338750437929929
to make matters clear , " typical " and thus every - day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material .    3.0771277362497105
finally , practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged .    3.5883769725689514
following shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous redon drains , while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial .    3.012927754608539
the amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis .    2.863082146257589
the degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score .    3.4149154537020783
the drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day ( 36 . 0 vs . 2 . 5 ml ) .    3.592677445807086
wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group .    4.9866980970391435
seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture .    2.7804251266826303
the drain only slightly affected personal impairment ( 25 . 6 % vs 21 . 4 % , visual analogue score ) .    3.6148277679218506
body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation ( 37 . 2 vs 36 . 7 °c ) .    3.1794668002841084
we believe there is no indication for the routine use of a redon drain in the repair of a primary inguinal hernia .    3.3152636891451763
instead , percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid UNK should be performed .    3.001948310958665
we report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement .    2.664925658691423
as a result of implanted cement / spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component , the iliac vessels were compressed .    2.7759033022230235
furthermore , we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65 - year - old patient during a revision operation .    3.199904754907823
for therapy in those cases extra - anatomic bypasses should be preferred to UNK .    3.257981598398417
one of the most important UNK of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints .    3.3780268848872086
such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or UNK .    3.342078323349828
the pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion .    3.1328545962744636
objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing .    3.6610921958102853
they are not detectable in x - ray , UNK or nmr .    3.7412236558252125
in this article , we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of UNK syndrome , a condition which consists of hearing loss ( 49 % ) , UNK ( 100 % ) , leukocyte inclusion bodies ( 100 % ) , eye anomalies ( 54 . 3 % ) , and nephritis ( 38 . 7 % ) .    3.8100505609782753
this article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es .    2.7651984927996947
standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained .    3.1662185193919146
different models of in vitro culture - UNK , three - dimensional tumor cultures , and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret UNK of in vivo tissue .    3.7274323485699803
two important recent extensions of tissue culture , serum - free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells , are described .    3.3774464442262433
for a quality assurance study on ponv , we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in UNK patients undergoing four different types of surgery ( subtotal thyroidectomy , laparotomy for gynaecological procedures , laparoscopy , and surgery for extra - abdominal procedures ) .    3.2159911701838033
the historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by " rolling in " should be controlled experimentally .    2.915237364945112
five segments of human femoral / popliteal artery ( 3 - 4 cm long ) were overstretched until complete rupture occured .    3.31355399943161
furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique UNK segment were ruptured .    2.8673631654929
this phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer , which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a chinese finger trap .    3.000407870906603
in the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed , while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued .    3.2723754681366817
neither UNK nor microscopical signs could be found for " rolling in " of intima or media layer .    2.5607754187558363
the reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than " rolling in " of intima or media layer .    2.3373370823016857
if there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot - or UNK a massive blood loss must be expected .    3.01714845645159
time and again a lack of staff in the field of people ' s nursing is discussed ( chronic lack of nursing staff ) ; this means that there are not enough people to do the available work ) ( 1 ) .    3.3594207068441158
however , the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people ' s stationary care .    3.0808748845565974
first of all , this article points out the time dimension throughout life .    3.222488615781357
this is followed by people ' s varying perceptions of the present and the related UNK and misunderstandings .    3.447910958459746
hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent .    3.0931059906200367
the old people ' s awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own UNK conflicts with the seemingly UNK time of each day that UNK .    2.937644626778818
intravascular ultrasound ( ivus ) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology .    2.782024277974851
the main reason is the capability to obtain " in - vivo " micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo - transducers with an outer diameter of 2 . 9 - 3 . 5 french .    3.6680199917178036
for the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on UNK but also on vessel wall assessment .    3.5203121503783237
the diagnostic strength of ivus is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis , to assess intermediate lesions , to reveal occult left main stem disease , and angiographically " silent " arteriosclerosis .    3.08001023735264
in conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve , patients with the diagnosis of coronary " syndrome x " can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis .    3.8292136450349363
additionally , ivus is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the aha / acc UNK classification .    3.834950776151342
there is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity .    3.244919992689088
however , there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters .    3.111227199178708
the development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto - orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature .    2.555782288257591
in a retrospective study on 33 patients ( 15 girls and 18 boys ) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically .    3.28170749381757
the radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of UNK at or above the level of the UNK rims , as projected in postero - anterior UNK .    3.463030008175531
according to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72 . 7 % of our patients .    3.3964524508442984
there was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient , age at surgery or the amount of advancement .    3.473821896614446
with the exception of severe cases of crouzon ' s disease we usually expect normal development of the frontal sinus following bilateral fronto - orbital correction .    3.262992748861332
failures after ankle arthrodesis are , according to the literature and our own experience , more frequently seen with external fixation than with internal fixation methods .    3.669290851217526
a vital x - ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic x - ray .    3.451251308161311
due to its variety of special projections , including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation , it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings .    3.45367406853503
it has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices , as well as of x - ray films and by new detection systems , such as sensors or screens .    3.644930192490297
although mr is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging , it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times .    3.1180828320398066
in certain cases , e . g . , changes to bone metabolism , differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image - aided analysis of function possible .    3.0110812150859325
secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with salmonella infections .    3.534813888244113
these atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre - existing local or systemic disease .    3.367398942109987
histologic analysis showed signs of pre - existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake .    3.3093023311278387
cartilage and bone were invaded and destructed by an aggressive granulation tissue .    3.0934734144193463
initially , a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour .    3.152292773352523
this case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist .    3.3986350350809196
there are two types of diabetes mellitus .    2.8717437891749324
type i , insulin - dependent diabetes ( iddm ) , which becomes manifest before the age of 40 , is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin .    3.43436552114567
type ii , the non - insulin - dependent diabetes ( UNK ) , develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency .    4.027188681178229
patients with type - i diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis , while type ii causes UNK , hyperosmolar , nonketotic coma .    3.2864568534855807
apart from these acute metabolic alterations , the long - term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist .    3.1323628837351816
to avoid perioperative metabolic UNK , blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6 . 7 and 10 mmol - l - 1 ( 120 - 180 mg - dl - 1 ) .    3.3524496594907194
hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage , whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain .    3.44838139556773
perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes .    3.9895141288829867
all type - i diabetics , UNK operation being performed , need insulin .    3.3539850331687666
the intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment .    3.679428852659846
after determination of the fasting blood glucose level , insulin is given at a dosage of 0 . 5 - 1 u - h - 1 ( at gluc < 11 . 1 mmol - l - 1 ) , 1 . 5 - 2 u - h - 1 ( at gluc 11 . 1 - 16 . 7 mmol - l - 1 ) or 3 u - h - 1 ( at gluc > 16 . 7 mmol - l - 1 ) .    2.8176154151993
in addition , 5 - 10 g glucose - h - 1 is given .    3.432926198546157
in type - ii diabetes the oral UNK drug is UNK .    3.3836630482840118
during minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently , and if necessary insulin ( with gluc > 13 . 9 mmol - l - 1 ) or glucose is given .    3.172523521761269
in most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary .    2.84733480105507
administration should follow the guidelines listed for type - i diabetes .    3.10901321434086
whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin , repeated glucose determinations are mandatory .    3.07767652204555
if ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline .    3.268855954868314
for hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin ( 3 - 6 u - h - 1 ) with 10 - 20 mmol - h - 1 potassium phosphate is given .    3.608584631015174
bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum ph is lower than 7 . 1 .    4.1790951274383294
it must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with UNK care .    2.7861966492367998
at the beginning of the 19 th century , institutional care for the UNK was established by the various german states .    3.242818402890533
at first , the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals .    3.0589530707762616
the combination of care and cure in one hospital in UNK was a turning point in institutional care .    3.304983451701569
contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century : the integration with general medicine in the cities , on the one hand , the social separation and cure in the UNK of the countryside , on the other .    3.5566861054648453
the characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual UNK .    3.015451413561797
the following building styles were dominant : in UNK , UNK architecture ; in the united states , linear staggered structures ; in france , the " UNK UNK " ; and in germany , the structure of blocks with cross - axes .    3.755531106724694
at the end of the 19 th century , the system of UNK was internationally accepted ; occupational therapy and mental care in the countryside were introduced .    2.95050539359287
from the first world war until the end of the UNK s , a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in germany , and institutional care came under increasing criticism .    3.5259766412234055
there was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities .    3.309054166504133
a variety of complementary institutions , outpatient and partly inpatient therapies , which were recommended by the " psychiatrie - enquête " , started to be realized .    3.1671658552331716
smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care , such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital , became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals , as did the integration into the community and the city .    3.4326562013790207
principles of organization like the construction of a communicative UNK inner room , or grading the rooms from public to private , were structurally integrated .    2.7808201867751112
specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post - occupancy methods .    3.1645540618388095
the coronal incision is a UNK approach to midface or skull base fractures .    3.5238199526198737
by this method , primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced .    3.8698201110725847
all trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re - examined to check functional and aesthetic results .    3.3706049401387554
the complication rate was low and the advantages of these techniques are evident , so that it is suggested that the indication for this operative approach should be extended .    3.5976677785567728
one case of a newly described , rare odontogenic tumor is reported .    3.31562397299969
a literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability , both regionally and UNK , of the clear cell odontogenic tumor .    3.1347880985074137
we conclude that this tumor is malignant , with a tendency to recur locally after surgery .    3.1183645487636134
in our patient we saw a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma and a squamous cell carcinoma , both with regional lymph node metastasis .    3.1840058159055196
the histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult .    3.3092542574018498
as the elderly segment of our population expands , there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group .    3.4180304804603643
the elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging , and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients .    3.7316895696212162
increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic - resistant organisms .    3.064662743988026
this article focuses on the epidemiological considerations , risk factors , types of infections that occur in elderly patients , and the guidelines for empiric therapy .    3.6484681602047555
the most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection , urinary tract infection , and skin and soft tissue infection .    3.741818145158
empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of UNK bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification ( age , medical illnesses , and severity of presentation ) .    3.331151784688639
many additional aspects , e . g . , route of administration , drug pharmacokinetics and UNK , drug toxicity and drug - drug interactions , compliance , and multiple underlying diseases ( e . g . , renal failure ) must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen .    3.4842137066134304
we present long - term results ( minimum follow - up 5 years ) in 145 patients with advanced non - UNK germ cell tumours , who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy ( UNK ) after chemotherapy .    4.281921798154707
we correlated patients ' outcomes ( death of disease ) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings .    3.411215311594941
we found that patients who were treated by a modified UNK scheme with cisplatin , etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis .    3.182645345354904
in all , 90 % showed no evidence of disease ( ned ) .    3.1955469771662974
the ned rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy ( UNK = 37 % ) . we determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome : .    3.7801969236932744
follow - up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis .    2.9799917353692376
in contrast , stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates .    3.6578293490802296
we sought to determine , if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts .    3.6945112687491375
we investigated long - term angiographic outcome of 205 stent implantations performed in 177 patients .    3.264012417084353
multivariate analysis correlated clinical , procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis > 50 % at follow - up .    3.056479451129159
angiographic restenosis was observed in 34 % of lesions treated .    3.778762258126825
multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus ( or 6 . 89 , ci2 . 41 - 9 . 69 ) , graft recanalization ( or 2 . 69 , ci 1 . 08 - 6 . 63 ) , lesion at the aortic anastomosis ( UNK . 98 , ci2 . 76 - 19 . 25 ) , lesion at the coronary anastomosis ( or 2 . 95 , ci1 . 18 - 7 . 49 ) , high diameter stenosis after stent placement ( or 7 . 01 , ci 2 . 64 - 15 . 71 ) , placement of long stents ( UNK . 78 , ci1 . 11 - 7 . 36 ) and implantation of more than one stent ( UNK . 34 , ci2 . 08 - 20 . 15 ) as independent predictors of graft in - stent restenosis .    3.3277835756615364
critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches .    3.7301185964317827
to compare the conventional 2 - d , the simulator - guided semi - 3 - d and the recently developed ct - guided 3 - d brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer .    2.8627254659502634
in 103 patients with t1 - 2 , n0 - 1 breast cancer the tumor bed was UNK during breast conserving surgery .    3.2972328038931
fifty - two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes .    3.1164571774271583
single , double and triple plane implant was used in 6 , 89 and 8 cases , respectively .    3.414394879331854
the dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times , 4 . 75 gy and 7 times 5 . 2 gy , respectively .    2.956193827653951
the positions of dose reference points varied according to the level ( 2 - d , semi - 3 - d and 3 - d ) of treatment planning performed .    3.524894096892656
the treatment planning was based on the 3 - d reconstruction of the surgical clips , implant tubes and skin points .    4.083127158488542
in all cases the implantations were planned with a semi - 3 - d technique aided by simulator .    2.8077166133422886
in 10 cases a recently developed ct - guided 3 - d planning system was used .    2.8596489703611367
the semi - 3 - d and 3 - d treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2 - d plans using dose - volume histograms and dose non - uniformity ratios .    2.8675697000445886
the values of mean central dose , mean skin dose , minimal UNK dose , proportion of UNK clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated .    3.0459092173833517
the accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique .    3.0372500376405087
with the help of conformal semi - 3 - d and 3 - d brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points , active source positions and UNK times individually .    2.520050967412726
this technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22 . 2 % and reduced the possibility of geographical miss .    3.7628215951825386
we could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the ct - image based 3 - d treatment planning , at the cost of worse dose UNK .    3.3154698654178487
the mean treated volume was reduced by 25 . 1 % with semi - 3 - d planning , however , it was increased by 16 . 2 % with 3 - d planning , compared to the 2 - d planning .    4.248456358603609
the application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal ( semi - 3 - d and 3 - d ) planning help to avoid geographical miss .    2.7249276769701587
ct is suitable for 3 - d brachytherapy planning .    3.814327485752407
better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques .    3.4159275730259346
conformal 3 - d brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts , taking the irregular 3 - d shape of the target volume into account .    3.7303281734557188
the routine clinical application of image - based 3 - d brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future .    3.2587217996401825
background : staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye .    3.165044066835541
in addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found .    2.944524901887322
according to UNK und UNK , with this staphylococci - associated UNK - kerato - conjunctivitis in culture - positive cases s . aureus is found in 31 % and s . UNK in 69 % of smears .    3.380808071506231
UNK and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology .    3.256698425744378
multiple organ failure ( mof ) may occur early or late after trauma .    2.7992090851263978
besides direct physical injury of organs , compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mof .    2.938677751613217
inflammation also induces UNK responses which may end up in immunoparalysis .    3.103618806106594
as a result , infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of mof .    2.922877977093255
in addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic mof , there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures .    2.9726743905837454
the aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states .    2.9123976458645613
early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ( " gut injury hypothesis " ) and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or UNK patients .    3.4487066270169193
nineteen severely injured patients ( injury severity score 40 . 3 + / - 11 . 6 ) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube .    3.2195795543999615
intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days .    3.4823093048366647
total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases ; a central venous line was always additionally necessary .    4.009603768470543
however , the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut .    3.085576180801216
the study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients .    2.3766135701742166
the expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified .    3.684462215618523
enterally fed patients may have a better outcome that those in whom only parenteral is employed .    3.7598197596670655
definition of the problem : the rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain - dead pregnant women since the 1980 ' s .    2.8710033106243387
the discussion today UNK around medical , social , legal and economic aspects .    3.11447761767003
the historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers ( usually by means of a UNK in UNK , nowadays known as a UNK caesarean section ) and their significance in today ' s debate are , for the most part , regarded as being of little relevance .    3.65807725378621
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( pcp ) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients , especially in aids cases .    3.5458976879937887
the present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign - body reaction in a patient with successfully treated pcp who was known to have aids .    3.476931505606801
this form of residues of completely healed pcp tends to be rare .    2.884833432148737
other infectious granulomas , foreign - body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed .    2.85342550951291
after UNK decalcification , UNK can be demonstrated with UNK silver ( UNK ) .    3.310468713696101
it is important to be aware that pcp can also undergo spontaneous cure , so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of aids .    3.1238817314482175
background : in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 - hydroxylase deficiency high pre - and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence UNK and psychosocial development in affected girls .    2.8617488851426978
methods : in order to study the impact of high androgen levels as well as chronic medication and repeated surgery on female patients life we performed a comprehensive quality - of - life study .    3.6673960547969386
we report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients ( 45 ) and their mothers ( 35 ) covering difficulties and problems in general , most aspects of their medical histology , self image , body image and current life with or without a male or female partner .    3.307540530729991
results : the patients were socially competent with a well developed social network .    3.209683043865499
however , regarding sexual contacts they were UNK and reluctant .    3.497336813010461
these resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are UNK .    2.932070985678694
existing UNK were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population .    4.159762463776515
the incidence of UNK was not increased .    3.3256215980521433
the number of women having children was significantly reduced .    3.107291156144914
a substantial number of women suffered from androgen - dependent problems like UNK UNK and UNK .    3.272244754823035
mothers and patients denied any sex - specific UNK , but the girls had preferred boy - specific toys and competitive UNK games .    3.475355020236571
however , school performance was average and comparable to the controls .    3.2192720229310283
most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters UNK at birth .    2.9977549227849667
even though they felt they had received good medical treatment , mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help .    3.309625204454299
conclusions : it seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease .    3.2719489831108555
however , postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality .    2.9609885643987317
early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance .    3.5647272144653313
materials and methods : we retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent olt at our institution .    3.684897815922433
duplex doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver .    4.067682018767512
other important techniques were ct , mri , and angiography , which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications .    3.2497220668575832
results : second to primary organ dysfunction , vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss .    3.245911276608835
thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication , with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 % .    3.357493650967919
bile duct UNK , leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation , which can contribute to graft dysfunction .    3.5266197635156638
biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy .    3.5524021641513963
since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy , they are at increased risk of developing late post - transplant malignancies , which are best depicted by us , ct or mri .    3.452715614579843
however , radiological diagnosis of lymphoproliferative disorder has to be confirmed by liver biopsy .    3.339610072522291
conclusion : cholangiography and duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with olt .    4.174266666171984
ct , mri , and angiography are problem - solving tools in equivocal cases .    2.907369606123631
recurrence of colorectal carcinomas occurs in about 50 % of the cases with localized neoplasia .    3.257817507535736
it is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or UNK ( peripheral blood or bone marrow ) .    3.4001191131523676
we developed a procedure to detect non - visible , abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti - tumor cell antibody injected before the operation ( UNK surgery , UNK ) .    3.3615289399392645
however , even with the best technique , it is not possible to remove all UNK if a UNK dissemination happens .    3.2829705827460907
based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens ( taa ) , we developed a new method to reduce and correct the b cell response and b cell recruitment due to chronic taa UNK complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells ( immune corrective surgery , ics ) .    2.9907431757512715
this method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy .    3.6686142479588044
the target lymph nodes were those loaded with taa - immune complex .    2.928818000777919
the detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex .    2.9064417079315756
from 20 patients ( stage i , ii and iii ) treated with ics , 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures .    3.4650953761634082
in conclusion , these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases , and more importantly , correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the t cell response against residual tumor cells .    3.144114625421557
knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist .    3.2762266171110213
analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal .    3.252842185467589
for this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar - arterial po2 difference is helpful .    3.005989137859214
pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation - perfusion ( v . a / q . )    3.3154313142022147
in daily practice , venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed - venous blood .    3.349026277188106
distribution are not possible in daily practice .    3.64491159386085
however , knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes .    4.264101776232895
background : infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions .    3.113311063022711
the case of a 30 year old man with UNK is presented .    3.3149502839581393
the congenital disorder is UNK by a lack or major reduction of UNK , an enzyme that UNK the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water .    3.6174567715553323
the defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion .    3.000705957315242
occasionally the defect UNK as progressive oral gangrene or UNK ' s , disease .    3.798211529526455
poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years .    3.3284766889440216
therefore , we decided to re - investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996 .    2.986010992343168
all patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml / min , as well as a pathological venous flow with UNK or UNK .    3.4708405518948413
these patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis .    3.2670914961007784
an up - to - date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire .    3.468462622640069
a total of 126 patients were available here for long - term follow - up .    2.6045405204833068
the short - term success rate for these groups after 1 - 3 months was an outcome of 31 ( 24 . 6 % ) , 25 ( 19 . 8 % ) and 70 ( 55 . 6 % ) patients ; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year ( p k 0 . 001 ) .    3.911434153488812
favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of k 7 years , a normal cc - emg and a maintenance flow of k 45 ml / min .    3.2467279670238067
this study reveals that long - term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing ; however , careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long - term results .    3.2600790418948127
pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems .    2.977890348849601
high UNK corticosteroids are the treatment of choice .    3.361860468447952
however , UNK pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives .    2.6851660981829717
pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine a .    3.180779856874644
because of side effects and drug interactions , the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored .    3.8562225243909265
six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum , unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies , were treated with oral cyclosporine a at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg / kg .    3.223889208178233
marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3 - 6 months .    3.874733972827451
only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment .    3.2124589586864327
no severe irreversible side effects occurred .    2.8658342202778067
the results show that low - dose cyclosporine a treatment can be considered a first - line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum .    3.4964560267261318
medical treatment of injured patients by international UNK of non - governmental organisations in crisis areas and out - of - area operations by UNK , and also national UNK require special trauma management .    3.5279261825236357
deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long - distance medical evacuation , the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries .    3.1637238241750207
massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster .    3.6505764011039763
in contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines , aggressive wound débridement is often needed .    2.70260681908548
timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad - spectrum antibiotic with a long half - life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds .    3.6243046472049807
suitable antibiotics for these indications are : UNK / UNK and UNK .    3.6650532154119677
nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement .    3.8367061889357217
craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis .    3.5173780635318517
the aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth , correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth .    3.136819198950831
the patient population consisted of 71 children ; the postoperative follow - up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months .    3.3039676658071264
of the children followed up , 36 were male and 21 female .    3.481667145263446
thirty - six cases involved untreated non - syndromic craniosynostosis ; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases .    2.8120995028610096
the patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months .    2.9457009203323627
in 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out .    2.963104459987833
the fronto - occipital circumference was registered in accordance with prader ' s percentile table .    3.1528456017118214
the operative method included a fronto - parietal craniotomy , the temporary removal and UNK of the fronto - orbital band and a vault cranioplasty .    3.3070397331981156
during follow - up 13 patients treated with fronto - orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve .    3.548456716122383
in 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed ; 1 patient changed to a higher curve .    3.698848805440328
in cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post - operatively registered percentile curve ; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve .    3.4314922875525746
no growth restriction of the UNK calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed .    4.058107404525225
no significant difference was found in the potential calvaria growth between syndromic and isolated craniosynostosis .    3.588577876567485
today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques .    3.621897338587478
the retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach .    3.304070242254478
the correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries .    3.7927954493836458
the overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the UNK effect of the UNK , which is , furthermore , positioned very close to the operative field .    4.83338760010782
it is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation .    3.2452902404298256
the decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined .    2.7680957126400756
lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age - related retinal degeneration .    3.9315789418873566
it is known that lipid peroxides can UNK UNK .    2.730353873381406
this property was used to localize lipid peroxides UNK in the retina .    4.105997871207046
in a 73 year - old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis , known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm , renal artery stenosis , and coronary artery disease , an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a UNK - peripheral stent graft .    3.57836954719792
angiographic follow up after 6 and 12 months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm .    3.43742218846525
intravascular ultrasound showed no neo - intimal hyperplasia within the stent .    2.8428624182051787
a computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm .    3.5605561886523693
based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in ra patients , new therapeutic principles have been developed , aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines .    3.0105667116914905
both principles , however , have proven to be very effective .    4.046059839989352
in addition , the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable , followed by a first , very carefully formulated protocol for human ra .    2.9477349785977958
gene therapy for ra has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage , not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to ra patients .    3.385698616312437
several problems , such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved .    3.929090477193858
with more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like ra in the coming years .    3.111496835868736
in the case of typical whiplash after low - energy rear - end collision we recommend a clear and structured therapeutic regimen to overcome and prevent neuromuscular deficits .    3.0183573573028193
patients with bony and UNK lesions have to be excluded , as well as patients with distinct neurologic deficits .    3.8521804086476124
a therapeutic rationale is the basis of full neuromuscular recovery ad integrum .    3.6732416447718665
the UNK of success in ether anesthesia on 16 october 1846 in UNK spread like UNK through europe .    2.9444947838154016
in the german - speaking countries , the national newspapers as UNK of the development played a prominent role ; this was especially the case for the UNK UNK UNK whose correspondent , aloys martin [ 1 ] , was a medical professional .    3.642764528071658
the function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated .    3.1521927240387155
this was to be remedied by examining both of bamberg ' s local papers .    2.7874840607405234
all issues from 01 . 01 . to 31 . 04 . 1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant UNK .    3.535620541671155
these were then UNK according to date , extent and contents .    3.4126638473425284
starting on 22 . 01 . 1847 , the events outside of and in bamberg were reported on in 26 UNK and articles of just a few lines to half a UNK and in advertisements ; aloys martin also appears on the scene .    3.1345068344282083
thus , the local press in bamberg also informed its readers early and regularly on the discovery of ether and the UNK events .    3.062125154068565
true arterial aneurysms of the UNK vessels are a rare finding .    4.287888299532578
during surgical treatment of UNK aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk .    3.6741161941794194
we describe the special features of diagnosis , histology , and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries .    3.782815080135689
we recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications .    2.8501503692680714
dementia is going to be one of the major challenges of the next century for our societies due to the enormous burden on the health care systems .    3.570275433077604
dementia is the major cause of death and the most important risk factor for disability and entry into a nursing home in elderly people .    3.5181069094811206
moreover , because of the progress in the treatment of alzheimer ' s disease , in particular with the cholinesterase inhibitors , demented people will be more often and detected earlier by general practitioners and families .    3.6447151762177246
nowadays operative sperm retrieval in connection with assisted reproduction is a well - established procedure in urological - gynecological cooperative groups .    3.1292685787781194
microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration ( UNK ) and testicular sperm extraction ( tese ) are the fundamental procedures in cases of non - UNK obstructive azoospermia or testicular azoospermia .    3.8544406831554365
as they are often favored percutaneous techniques such as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration ( UNK ) or percutaneous testicular sperm extraction ( UNK ) , need to be in anglo - american countries and the countries of northern europe , discussed regarding their efficacy ( number of retrieved UNK ) and possible testicular injury due to blind or ultrasound - guided puncture .    3.264705194984007
in middle UNK , one of the larger bavarian administrative division ( population 1994 : 1 , UNK , 101 ) , the number of patients suffering from cancer pain , chronic headache and chronic back pain is not known .    4.1643744080071885
furthermore , there are no data on interdisciplinary organization of outpatient pain management .    2.9343868529716524
a 34 - year - old hiv - infected african woman developed fever , weight loss and widespread papules on her trunk , arms and face .    2.974783817089565
skin biopsy and culture revealed histoplasmosis caused by histoplasma capsulatum varietas capsulatum ( american histoplasmosis ) .    2.544915929794418
even though antimycotic treatment and intensive care were started immediately the patient died because of the systemic mycosis within a few days .    3.7694007853999443
histoplasmosis is a rare disease in europe but endemic in some areas of the usa ( e . g .    3.3210243354507067
ohio , UNK ) and of africa .    5.352530053214881
additionally histoplasma capsulatum varietas UNK is endemic in central and south africa .    2.9999197746534807
as a consequence of scientific advances , an increasing number of patients with advanced age , reduced myocardial performance , previous cardiac surgery , UNK , and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery .    3.445353798132062
this requires risk stratification to predict " low " , " moderate " , and " high " operative risk .    3.30716596773151
risk factors can be divided into pre - , intra - , and postoperative patient - , structure - , and procedure - related .    3.7178968900627467
on the basis of this risk prediction , the perioperative course can be optimized by an individually tailored UNK and interdisciplinary management .    2.862233313341991
unnoticed , minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction , resulting in UNK and hypercapnia .    3.8036581676128436
we report one case of a potential life - threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction , modified machine - check procedures , or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine - check procedure .    3.1127254895036875
the general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment - so - called borderline damage - may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer .    3.0535985283852853
most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that UNK through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non - functional .    3.095614970146966
in reality , this is not the case .    4.987613014836823
intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine - check procedures .    2.84250634794532
this problem results in a significant but UNK increased in risk to patients .    3.609138487224583
because of unclear UNK of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage , there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist .    3.1044564106854504
the risk of mechanical malfunction might be displaced by software problems in new - generation ventilators in the market .    2.846819824417077
purpose : to investigate whether the margins of microscopic tumors can be delineated better with UNK iron oxide UNK ( UNK ) , a superparamagnetic contrast medium , than with gd - dtpa by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .    2.7876385974631845
nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days .    3.835768825239396
this is probably due to the fact that primary osteosynthesis is performed in ankle fractures instead of the conservative treatment given up to 20 years ago .    3.6436689084205693
today nonunions of the malleoli are seen , if at all , is infected cases after surgical procedures .    3.1434817783300066
UNK , stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction .    3.009803873084106
in painful cases , small fragments , especially of the medial malleolus , should be resected ; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3 . 5 - mm cancellous screws .    3.6917824392625134
alternatively , the tension banding technique , especially after weber a fracture , produces high compression in the area of nonunion .    3.3687687153342787
in cases of additional bony defects , a local upside down cortical - cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition .    3.3985422252431556
in summary , the therapeutic approach requires exact remodeling , bone - grafting and stabilization .    3.1420272896362147
infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy .    4.149556058165097
this study investigated the influence of the patients ' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods ( psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis ) .    3.6260299406164647
we considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in germany .    2.7994221357542535
data were collected from the therapists ' case history ( n = UNK ) , submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies .    3.3028892105889414
we found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy .    2.7591689159474138
in our sample 43 . 5 % had graduated from senior high school compared with 25 . 1 % in the average german population .    2.9092668794993304
this relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis .    2.904209765982538
51 . 7 % of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13 . 2 % from junior high school compared with 48 . 7 % in the average german population .    3.447101784842091
also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education , not on gender , age or type of statutory health insurance .    3.891460449467737
these results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are UNK .    3.053060942335822
after the initial enthusiasm subsided UNK of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as UNK voiding symptoms which may last for weeks .    4.023720234758786
thanks to new UNK techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated .    3.0109128973638866
with the UNK laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ( " what you see is what you get " ) .    3.1784555143182507
the postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after tur - p .    2.898834380432906
the classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading , when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs .    3.8030042816175804
the introduction of spiral - ct with multiplanar reformations and 3 - d views has improved the quality of visualization .    3.7559289071412345
due to their higher costs , the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned .    3.614458934082667
this paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs , 2 - d - cts , 3 - d - cts and UNK - cts ( UNK ) for the classification of acetabular fractures , based on a controlled study .    3.60011622730146
methods : thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each : group i comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery , group ii was physicians with 3 - 10 years of operative experience , and group iii was experts in acetabular surgery .    3.2130917523577818
a total of 10 complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics ( plain radiographs , 2 - d - ct , ct with multiplanar UNK , 3 - d - ct , fs - ct ) of different acetabular fracture types were prepared .    3.000047281670915
the task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint ( e . g . marginal impaction , head fractures , etc . ) .    2.941556582185177
the different diagnostic " levels " could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given .    2.7253068314121527
the case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis .    2.890623655667879
the use of the different radiographs , the preliminary diagnosis , the changes in diagnosis , and the final decisions were recorded .    3.7982253356446196
these findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a " consensus classification " which was generated by thorough discussion , and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates .    3.4217651770057373
based on 2 - d - ct a " correct " diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group i , by 55 % in group ii , and by 76 % in group iii .    3.8567351514957067
with consideration of the " transient forms " in acetabular fractures based on letournel and the 3 - d - ct used mainly by group i , the rate of " correct " classifications rose to 65 % in group i , 64 % in group ii and 83 % in group iii .    3.6022037828895295
the modifiers were diagnosed " correctly " in group i by 37 % , in group ii by 56 % , and in group iii by 73 % .    4.274210896303106
the use of the 3 - d - ct and especially the fs - ct by group i resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 % , whereas in group ii the fs - ct was used only UNK .    3.5116876018601477
the 2 - d - ct was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in 73 % complete diagnoses in group iii .    3.386058775468614
this study showed the importance of ct for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures .    3.59097515289031
in particular , the secondary reformations in ct and the 3 - d - views dramatically improved the rate of " correct " classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery .    3.047899859171152
this allows the less experienced an acceptable level of " correct " diagnoses , so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly .    3.1147170393090033
among the " experts " a rate of divergent UNK of approximately 20 % was observed , especially in " transient " forms of acetabular fractures .    3.43726521547002
background : UNK is the clinical sign of lens subluxation .    3.3891608841377114
acute glaucoma caused by a UNK block may develop .    3.9593460922213954
the results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for UNK lens and glaucoma are reported .    2.65492602014674
cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators .    3.2587321359339394
transcranial doppler ( tcd ) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli .    4.131451456885688
the aim of this study was to analyze cerebral UNK in patients with high - grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short - and long - term effects of desobliteration .    3.270463964830588
a total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re - evaluated 1 year later .    2.745326623434555
the preoperative vasomotor capacity using tcd with co2 was 57 % + / - 45 .    3.110357636792618
hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere , and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102 % + / - 80 % .    3.5435556890878717
one year later patients with unilateral stenosis ( n = 11 ) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65 % + / - 46 % after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51 % + / - 35 % to 48 % + / - 38 % .    3.668800123649012
patients with bilateral stenoses ( n = 9 ) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70 % + / - 60 % to 48 % + / - 21 % and a significant rise to 115 % + / - 77 % 1 year later ( p = 0 . 02 ) .    3.649647970335012
chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups : slow - transit constipation , caused by pathological intestinal transit , and obstructive defecation disorder , caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities .    3.1904779344240435
videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum .    3.212028319539559
defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures .    3.3305134243122985
within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease .    3.461074385303468
in patients with slow transit , both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder ( slow transit : defecoflowmetry 65 % , videodefecography 80 % ; obstructive defecation disorder : 50 % and 58 % ) .    2.93162340467767
the evacuation time was pathologically prolonged in both types of constipation , with a range of 43 - 55 s . UNK are demonstrated in 94 % of cases with slow transit and in 72 % with obstructive defecation disorder .    3.4289086023819064
also , we often found obstructive components in slow - transit constipation patients .    2.7908134443567083
normal UNK or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder .    2.8525875679364234
we conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation .    2.682567536574776
absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain .    4.471675481611421
previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies .    3.4509104823082213
we present mri scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum .    2.8421637865549436
the patient was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis .    3.1447613064499187
mental retardation or epileptic seizures , which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders , were not observed .    3.5952186651013296
the septal area is part of the limbic system and UNK of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system .    3.6630849222206225
the concept of cerebral maldevelopment and the limbic system in schizophrenic psychosis is discussed .    2.9656098587950455
history and clinical findings : a 61 year old man presented with newly developed tachyarrhythmia .    3.5886217423341793
echocardiographically a tumour of unclear origin in the left atrium was diagnosed .    3.693231605824716
investigations : the heart rate in the ecg was arrhythmic at 146 / min ; intermittently sinus rhythm was established .    3.5620862393001294
the chest x - ray showed a mediastinal UNK mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border .    3.285981323780416
computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses ; hence the difference between an ( intra - ) cardiac tumour ( i . e .    3.1399029730433625
myxoma ) and a tumour of UNK ( mediastinal ) origin could not be established .    4.565466518887027
additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a UNK cyst , which spread UNK up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the UNK region , thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium .    4.526884942548303
therapy : for certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy .    3.337025471776357
histologically a UNK , benign cyst with an inner layer of UNK and UNK as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed .    3.9912478972992083
since the operation the patient has persistent sinus rhythm without symptoms of relevant rhythm disorders .    3.163797739170243
an overview of different kinds of UNK cysts is given .    3.20317540933632
longstanding and untreated scaphoid fractures and scapholunate UNK lead to painful destruction of the wrist with carpal collapse .    3.6005814526776447
the severity of degenerative arthrosis is classified in three stages and can be treated adaequate operatively .    3.544993898797446
snac wrist ( scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse ) after failed fusion of the scaphoid and slac wrist ( scapholunate advanced collapse ) after scapholunate dissociation should be differentiated .    2.8555362659624373
the reconstruction of the scaphoid or scapholunate ligament in stage ii and iii is no reasonable option .    3.459995359444982
motion preserving procedures such as proximal UNK UNK or midcarpal arthrodesis are preferable in this situation .    3.4069574277881283
thirty - one male patients ( average 41 years ) were treated for snac or slac wrist with midcarpal arthrodesis .    3.2797946026225153
all patients were reexamined , the mean follow - up was 15 months .    3.314975318312527
grip strength was measured with the dexter - system , pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale ( vas 0 - 100 ) .    3.3889084557271114
patients ' daily activities and general quality of life were estimated with the dash - questionnaire .    3.3676130464261367
pain was reduced to 50 % compared to the preoperative situation .    4.206280092456909
grip strength improved to 60 % of the opposite side .    4.132473117626478
active range of motion reached 50 % of the contralateral wrist .    4.41117514060968
nonunion at the fusion site necessitated additional surgery in four patients resulting in total wrist arthrodesis .    3.2186862881653107
midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper UNK of the UNK is performed .    3.9634917826346774
the dash - score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility .    3.569450700701776
total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense .    2.979533425176049
stress fractures are one of the most common UNK injuries seen in athletes , accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics .    3.4105875803845684
UNK are particularly prone to these injuries , however , it is difficult to predict injury as there is usually a critical interplay between the athlete ' s biomechanical predisposition , training methods , and other factors such as diet , and muscle strength and flexibility .    3.462767961190503
this article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice .    3.26563279538135
a classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury .    3.5441161892047233
today , enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice , partially due to the UNK that intestinal resorption of UNK is impossible .    3.6084739526257907
however , there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity , and placebo - controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy .    3.241687218515124
the documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma , resulting in pain reduction and better mobility .    3.488210771097244
there are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery , traumatology , plastic surgery , and dental surgery .    3.1080662417356506
a further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes .    3.464449940709413
in gynaecological treatments , enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries .    3.5852576596971932
breast UNK is a further indication for enzyme therapy .    3.714372639742247
further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits .    3.162322078249762
high - frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in UNK respiratory failure of neonates .    2.91364047952307
we report the case of a term infant with UNK aspiration syndrome , who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high - frequency ventilation .    2.8790432872667218
at an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right - to - left shunting and improve oxygenation .    3.152943652611285
how - ever the respiratory situation did not improve , the oxygenation index increased to 25 .    3.2903017140849657
after discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to UNK with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar .    3.413127216530077
again UNK - tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31 .    3.219468686031394
at that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high - frequency ventilation .    3.251707261454637
immediately oxygenation improved significantly , the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after UNK nitric oxide .    3.1016435396269006
this effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high - frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from UNK could be performed .    3.380410512206933
ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult .    2.9588638653349397
due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities , the UNK of facsimiles up to now has been impossible .    3.8552863661848975
rapid UNK techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one .    3.0388530343088287
by using ct scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3d pictures on a cad workstation .    2.995129905068291
we are now able to incorporate data in a UNK system to create an anatomic UNK of the temporal bone .    4.178581142398875
it is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object .    3.3375884385119527
with this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching , training and research .    3.1049178149969032
our artificial preparations of temporal bones correspond to both the material characteristics and anatomic details of human structures , allowing various surgical exercises to be carried out .    2.9978750232894553
during the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal .    3.861565535955097
the treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so - called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities , especially during the first phase .    4.155239264259804
numerous controlled studies and meta - analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease - modifying drugs , with regard to efficacy and side effects .    3.649504980220991
during the first stage of these disease , the immunobiological substances against pro - inflammatory cells are employed .    3.154373352666643
improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment , correct diet and careful observation of the patient ' s progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality .    3.588933689565613
intrinsic positive end - expiratory pressure ( peepi ) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants , expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance ( tubes , valves , etc . ) .    2.787681649139461
it is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients , but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings .    3.5864250735951213
the method was validated in ten sedated , UNK patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies ( five with restrictive , and five with obstructive pulmonary disease ) .    3.3849903359342437
peepi was determined using the volume constant ventilatory mode at UNK or at an external peep of 5 as well as 10 cm h2o .    3.578047258327955
peepi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the evita ( five measurements at each end - expiratory pressure level ; peepevita ) .    2.81960140917415
steady - state was attained between each measurement .    3.4999310215758443
these values were compared to the results obtained with end - expiratory occlusion ( external , computer - controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit ) at the respective pressure levels ( peepeeo ) .    3.3355814799733787
the average of five measurements at each peep level with each method was defined as peepi for the particular ventilatory situation .    2.8887786646577354
gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated UNK ( fleisch no .    3.1395239415962433
2 , fleisch , UNK , switzerland ) and a differential pressure transducer .    4.629710904865946
tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer ( dr . UNK & gut , basel , switzerland ) .    3.3287333565435397
after a / d conversion , data were sampled with a frequency of 20 hz and processed on an UNK compatible pc .    3.0095572176802454
software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self - programmed .    3.8710901716915562
for the statistical analysis we used the mann - whitney u - test or wilcoxon signed - ranks test ; a p value less than 0 . 05 was considered significant .    2.785045479606564
at the given respiratory setting and without peep patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher peepi ( median : 6 . 4 cm h2o ; range : 5 . 0 - 9 . 6 cm h2o ) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease ( median : 2 . 3 cm h2o ; range : 0 . 8 - 3 . 0 cm h2o ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.5827726917029814
increasing external peep to 5 or 10 cm h2o significantly decreased the pressure difference between peepi and external peep ( p < 0 . 05 ) , but was unable to eliminate it completely .    3.1823305150340104
there was no statistically significant difference between peepeeo and peepevita ( p = 0 . 43 ; wilcoxon signed - ranks tests ) .    2.7874894440289295
regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between peepeeo and peepevita values ( r = 0 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 ; y = 1 . UNK - 0 . 18 ) .    3.4446761970263498
peepi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease .    3.8430776733959906
the difference between external end - expiratory pressure and peepi decreases with increasing external peep .    2.858026578276006
however , peepi may increase with increasing external peep in some instances .    3.1130237271972714
the reason for this may be that the peepi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different peepi values of various lung regions .    3.1499145204259555
increasing external peep only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on peepi values lower than external peep .    3.202130136447357
the peepi values measured by the evita respirator compared with classical end - expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical .    3.17302532281811
unfortunately , peepi measurement of the evita can only    3.864060223742115
we report on the case of a 70 - year - old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a UNK of the left eye .    3.6342330865457084
this rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient .    3.7487549221860363
the naevus spread on the left side from parietal to UNK , UNK and sternal .    4.137905607038897
because of the patient ' s cardio - pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia .    3.1041866022316844
we also made a partial UNK excision of the left - sided parietal parts of the naevus .    4.013224691723436
we describe an hla - b27 positive patient in whom posttraumatic pyogenic UNK led to complete unilateral UNK joint ankylosis in the absence of any signs indicative of hla - b27 associated UNK .    2.9320239025479746
ondansetron , a selective 5 - UNK receptor antagonist , has recently been shown , in a dose of 8 mg , to be superior to 1 . 25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting .    3.623581404373636
there are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [ 16 ] .    2.8746417789276197
the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the adverse effects of 4 mg ondansetron in the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting compared to droperidol in patients undergoing surgery with inhalation anaesthesia supplemented with alfentanil .    2.6618110908169252
following institutional approval , 40 asa physical status i and ii women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized , double - blind comparative study .    2.9318179122759287
five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia , 20 patients received a single intravenous ( iv ) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1 . 25 mg droperidol iv .    3.2033468886440604
anaesthesia was induced with 2 . 1 - 4 mg / kg of thiopental and 0 . 1 mg of alfentanil iv and maintained with 65 % nitrous oxide and 1 . 5 % - 3 % enflurane in oxygen .    4.175245509353602
on pain stimuli another 0 . 2 - 0 . 4 mg of alfentanil was given .    4.5521384710838015
total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively .    3.6045652698535733
the incidence of nausea , vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and p < 0 . 05 was considered significant .    3.3620613073160706
patients were similar with respect to age , height , body weight and total anaesthetic agents received .    3.1685474458286556
duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups .    3.8532288025247263
postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol UNK ( n . s . ) .    3.1007741898834404
the incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group , and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.9357618457016836
sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    3.1673793213765253
postoperative sedation and well - being scores did not differ significantly among groups .    3.4596230228571914
our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1 . 25 mg of droperidol .    2.9649357703774197
the drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil .    2.832768555854245
a 66 - year - old woman died of internal bleeding and pulmonary fat embolism following repeated massive UNK from a UNK UNK and an electric UNK .    3.764426358206046
the initial autopsy diagnosis was natural death .    2.9496584728098316
a second UNK on the UNK body and an intensive criminal investigation revealed a long history of maltreatment by two sisters with whom the victim lived .    3.378449059610093
the maltreatment occurred during UNK with the UNK purpose of UNK the victim of her UNK by UNK .    4.460893280496505
the UNK and the victim UNK to the same UNK UNK .    4.210317482715835
the elder of the two sisters had been previously UNK of a fatal UNK maltreatment of a 17 - year - old girl .    3.8619515087392444
since 1993 , 30 patients with acute distal intraarticular radius fractures have been treated under arthroscopic assistance .    2.530527432247378
according to the ao classification there were 3 b - and 27 c - fractures , most of them UNK viii fractures .    3.1337283966879763
of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view .    3.504216203483273
in particular , 12 partial or complete tears of the UNK ligaments were found .    3.7497780147712914
of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically .    3.508655481586757
x - rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability , especially of the scapholunate ligaments .    3.4381256492372283
clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a jamar ( UNK ) tester .    3.354914159140139
each test was performed on both wrists for comparison .    3.681475664564664
subjective data included pain and function for daily activities .    3.1116204080205474
data were evaluated by the jakim and the cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by gartland and werley as modified by sarmiento et al .    1.9826320738676417
about 70 % of our patients showed an excellent or good result ; about 15 % had a poor result .    3.145343699621922
however , we must mention that we were not able to reduce one c3 - fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi - open procedure with additional external UNK .    3.05346273342953
arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions , but seems to give good midterm results as well .    3.219126368032524
antitachycardia pacing techniques ( atp ) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) .    2.8293035805922404
however , little is known about the efficacy and safety off atp during long - term follow - up in a larger study population .    3.162755118647361
50 pts ( 62 . 5 % ) had coronary artery disease , 18 ( 22 . 5 % ) dilative cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) , the remaining 12 pts ( 15 % ) had no or other cardiac diseases .    3.77805331925873
UNK episodes of ventricular tachycardia ( cycle length UNK + / - 51 ms , 240 - 520 ms ) occurred in 64 / 80 pts ( 80 % ) , overall efficacy of atp was 89 . 9 % , acceleration occurred in 4 . 1 % of UNK .    3.6550759107853197
success of atp did not correlate with positive atp testing on induced arrhythmias , UNK , nyha class or aneurysm .    3.4527916736127895
neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the atp success rate .    3.1964128101913456
atp efficacy was linked significantly to short vt cycle length ( UNK , 240 - 300 ms , p < 0 . 01 ) and long coupling intervals ( 91 - 97 % ) , p < 0 . 01 ) .    3.067103906590278
acceleration occurred in 32 % of pts and in 4 . 1 % of vt episodes ; it was also dependent on short vt cycle length ( < 300 ms vs > 300 ms , p < 0 . 04 ) and short coupling intervals ( < 81 % vs > = 81 % , p < = 0 . 01 ) .    3.344691398652984
methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and spectroscopy ( UNK ) in order to develop suitable tools for non - invasive characterization of hematopoetic bone marrow .    3.8887822360799174
the methods were applied for the assessment of normal values in healthy persons and to examine patients with generalized hematological diseases or to monitor effects of therapies influencing the composition of bone marrow .    3.5686977477257154
lichen ruber planus is considered a t - cell mediated immunologic reaction with unclear pathogenesis .    3.4903166512338326
drugs and infections ( especially hepatitis b and c ) are well - known provocation factors .    3.6793978513251844
after an infection with scabies a 13 year old boy developed a generalized lichen planus including bullous lesions .    3.0812444877268432
for the first time scabies is presented as a trigger for lichen planus .    2.791027420060711
in childhood , lichen planus is characterized by atypical clinical features and sometimes a severe course .    3.9371940323169334
introduction : increasing demands on quality assurance und medical performance documentation require an UNK and evaluable documentation in the outpatients ' department .    2.9902578259154886
presentation of a new computer - based diagnostic system for reporting and medical performance documentation .    3.4964339960986233

presentation of the documentation flow and its transfer into other contexts .    3.1090358289521944
discussion : pure text - based clinical results do not allow sufficient UNK for quality assurance and medical performance documentation .    3.0552728303227723
however , a computer - based and immediate documentation in outpatients ' departments should not mean a significantly increased workload for physicians .    2.7792619982576903
hydromorphone is a UNK receptor agonist opioid .    4.039861421638877
according to who recommendations , hydromorphone is to be classified in step iii of pain therapy .    3.296965539394484
an oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently .    3.3077955710982283
the controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain .    3.367222543230978
the oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step iii .    3.5669375287123297
hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief ( despite increase of doses ) or causes intolerable side effects ( despite treatment of symptoms ) .    2.9713009135151736
in principle , no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected .    3.215750529130813
however , clinical experience shows that changing one opioid analgesic to another one can improve the treatment of patients so that hydromorphone may replace another opioid analgesic to which a patient fails to respond well or develops side effects .    3.131027079806695
the dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg .    2.968840885485434
the values for the absorption , bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours - of three times the dose - are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours .    3.352892930887001
in several open label and controlled studies , hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain , especially in patients with severe cancer pain .    4.065056369767001
with regard to the incidence of side effects , no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established .    3.9839478935037778
in general , the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics .    3.1243961838918453
in 63 patients , 82 elevations of the maxillary sinus were performed .    3.032997784381663
as augmentation , materials autografts from the iliac crest ( combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus UNK ) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive , allogeneic bone powder ( aaa bone ( autolyzed , antigen - extracted , allogeneic bone ) : n = 8 , UNK ( demineralized freeze - dried bone allograft ) and / or UNK ( demineralized bone matrix gel ) : n = 35 ) were used in 43 cases .    3.2222205530853376
some 4 - 6 months after implantation , osteoinductive , allogeneic ( demineralized ) bone implants showed radio - opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation .    3.256574231366273
histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients ' own bone tissue .    3.0821996663187274
the average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( + / - 3 ) mm in comparison with 9 ( + / - 3 ) mm after allograft implantations .    3.3075574509422037
histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials .    4.789406670563392
on an average 2 endosseous implants ( bone UNK or UNK - screw implants ) were inserted into the UNK maxillary sinus UNK in both groups .    3.795237687518019
no osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group .    3.3765910258947427
patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( + / - 9 ) days ( without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days ) .    3.6863004314791117
the average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( + / - 5 ) days .    3.200332634723404
the 13 patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom - free several hours after the operation .    3.118744073481633
under critical consideration of all investigated parameters , osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required .    2.9269572947268645
we describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma .    3.089759933779159
in the literature available , only six clinical cases have been reported .    3.1368973940253917
a 64 - year - old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma .    3.912863544450371
histological examination after nephrectomy , however , revealed a plasmacytoma .    3.564450975718598
based on this case , we discuss how one should proceed in this disease .    3.205230732305658
primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or UNK - jones proteinuria , as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures .    3.620482249921287
postoperatively , further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement ( solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma ) .    2.7692184720558704
nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur .    3.8758531721028104
dissection of the ascending aorta ( type a ) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency .    3.6892716722723886
this study analyzes the role of aortic valve replacement for the evolution of late dissection .    3.586014501136926
between december 1986 and november 1995 , 222 patients with 225 acetabular fractures were treated operatively by three surgeons in the department of traumatology and emergency surgery of the university hospitals of the UNK university of UNK .    3.7233133291607747
indications for surgery were unstable fracture , displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra - acetabular fracture fragments .    2.798540317888227
there were 37 . 3 % a - fractures , 49 . 7 % b - fractures , and 13 % c fractures according to the ao classification .    3.9316907729901542
in 16 . 4 % of fractures there were primary neurological deficits .    3.480309471040228
patients were treated operatively after an average of 5 . 0 days .    4.338780058537881
the kocher - langenbeck approach was used in 56 . 9 % of cases , the UNK - inguinal approach in 27 . 1 % and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4 % .    4.182232931764823
in 7 . 1 % of patients , a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted .    3.7631540602549496
there was no intra - UNK perioperative mortality .    2.845509188821881
the average hospital stay was 26 . 1 days .    3.4235908851890815
deep infections were present in 1 . 3 % .    4.139700995131481
in 11 . 1 % of patients a second operative procedure was necessary .    4.042269307484674
we were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years .    3.099922388847707
signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x - rays : walking distance , hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination .    3.3472993191143243
in 76 % of patients an excellent or good result on the merle - d ' aubigne scale was obtained .    3.2846934231452947
t - fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results .    3.7420136914654187
during this 9 - year period , changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out , the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification .    3.5812425874017393
after thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique , it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches .    3.4564835500886977
because the fractures are relatively rare , their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult , specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon .    3.1866011944798602
diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are UNK classified as malignant , with consequences for treatment and prognosis .    3.14490651073917
examples are necrotizing UNK , UNK warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic UNK .    3.6776012378415155
the proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of UNK tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes .    3.3985694013625167
in these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis , especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases ( e . g .    3.102093377994878
nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma .    2.874531174318542
the initial stage of malignant UNK lymphomas in association with sjögren ' s syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic UNK .    3.0319974697031964
the diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail .    2.7822539706294087
a 59 - year - old male patient was UNK operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with UNK .    3.3832871875297044
a second operation and x - ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor .    2.979584116137473
both neoplasmas were classified as UNK UNK prolactin cell adenomas .    3.5578138778752018
immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and fsh in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor .    3.5455616914763475
two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated .    3.1501504851580737
a tumor in the liver was identified .    4.158996067545502
biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology .    2.938916586845024
due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor .    3.2667571725355358
after 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism .    3.7618021483456543
post - mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin - secreting pituitary carcinoma .    3.324815119082776
only six similar cases have been reported in the literature .    2.644989329689476
our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas UNK in the current literature : malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor , but only from its metastases .    3.557062931512282
paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease .    3.139210141211656
while some disorders almost invariably UNK an underlying malignancy ( UNK marker ) , most only occasionally do so ( facultative marker ) .    2.871094218356455
the association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial .    2.9181749121773226
there are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma .    3.507583714832705
we diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient , admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid .    3.1354795231344283
multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes , liver , lung and skeleton .    3.759393928355663
the patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared .    3.3151335209639745
acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature .    2.667479881618409
the multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur .    3.2844931925395406
fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of UNK swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient .    3.580767641649232
sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury .    4.027770445678198
during the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated .    3.3048909309505485
therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma .    3.1694801155899452
no direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome .    3.467905960929966
the tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy .    3.606056167101288
conclusion : early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain , paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient .    2.918956505794366
tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign .    3.7630749206685623
frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients .    3.320112116841331
we suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far UNK by the morbidity that UNK an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy .    3.092931643120178
aim : the long - term effect of UNK with cystic fibrosis was examined .    3.586188331924565
teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers .    4.386925480544548
using their records such as x - rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification .    3.2187159088724955
to evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined .    3.137720916356829
only 3 % of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media .    3.615369771347092
to improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey .    3.1467764324773317
according to these results a new concept of presentation UNK be developed to improve the efficency of this UNK method .    3.3628639361506423
new technological possibilities such as digital x - UNK or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification .    3.0090899309628565
the propoxur decomposition product o - isopropoxyphenol ( 2 . 8 - 56 µg / g ) , benzyl alcohol ( 18 - 58 µg / g ) and its UNK product benzoic acid ( 85 - 140 µg / g ) , isopropanol ( 0 . 45 - 1 . 1 mg / g ) and acetone ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 03 mg / g ) were also found .    3.5734775418801945
on the other hand , the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher .    2.732414668848543
as a reason for these immense concentration differences an UNK aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed .    2.7770095193292397
the extent of the UNK of propoxur to o - isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid , which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem , was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver .    3.324549558522611
the intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death .    2.988519078135172
background : despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty ( dlkp ) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty ( UNK ) , this procedure is rarely performed .    3.5121321355782036
we therefore investigated whether or not the dlkp technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity .    2.8171672520406834
palmoplantar keratodermia ( ppk ) varians and ppk punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar UNK .    3.1289529893769363
keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata .    2.9838754048159073
we describe a 31 - year - old man exhibiting both UNK and papular keratoses on the UNK , as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases .    3.510615394936888
in view of the co - occurrence of these two types of ppk , the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect .    3.1250950014550027
the author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and / or political reasons UNK psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national UNK germany .    3.0415238751129476
with reference to current studies on emigration , which for germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and UNK , the immigration policy especially of the united states and great britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed .    3.269950147745786
in this context , the major importance of the solidarity and help the UNK were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional UNK is emphasized .    3.0802206611465777
acute suppurative UNK is very rare in childhood .    3.607445082289725
we describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children , and add 2 own cases of this rare disease .    3.350061159479296
in the first case , diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid .    3.376543848454865
operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then .    3.7506368875492146
in the second case , a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only .    3.1039384127122553
seven years later , no recurrent abscess occurred in this child .    3.3730021183345915
in conclusion , especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection .    3.224442784915205
if present , complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure .    3.9968743419229633
the importance of spiral - ct is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors .    1.8537580285594373
its importance for follow - up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors .    2.1379185880547174
using spiral - ct multiple signs of alterations ( n = 98 ) can be diagnosed , which are not only important for tumour relapse , but also for assessment .    2.377282703553099
spiral - ct offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy .    2.2026123228221075
in follow - up examinations after radiation , laryngoscopy and spiral - ct are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath - holding technique ( separately reconstructed ) and also as functional spiral - ct of the vocal cords in " i " - phonation .    1.754678769621212
UNK in scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries .    3.1086409501416297
only a few days later e . c . j .    2.966229752057646
following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non - pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour , he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients .    3.0958510911036337
the first administration was on february UNK 1847 .    2.869290817277493
while he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new - born , he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients .    3.1981903713957722
he concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery , since it disturbed the natural course of labour .    3.1056938453492946
on the other hand , von siebold was very UNK with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention .    2.8914395610399692
background : mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that UNK metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias .    2.883127852231974
this allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from av synchronous pacing modes . aim and method : beat - to - beat mode switching in UNK and clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm , ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns .    2.979522361098705
atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm .    4.689278059851303
a too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat - to - beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia .    3.32298575987831
mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event : atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor ( qt interval and activity ) .    3.4796600230070727
dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset .    3.7988201189870745
both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic , rendering follow - up procedures easy and less time - consuming .    3.071378347512743
conclusion : reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching .    3.1406146927565497
therefore , the pacemaker UNK the distribution of the amplitude of all atrial events , both during sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias , which facilitates the appropriate programming of the atrial sensitivity .    3.115832584380946
introduction : mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by ct and mri .    3.095495434145221
the applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air - and bone - containing thorax , which permits only restricted echo windows .    3.1237742920918286
transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography UNK this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum .    3.2471185819862076
blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome , possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure .    3.2266152601094964
cerebral effects of hyper - or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) are less well known .    2.8482786769040365
in addition , little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations .    3.0968532349863174
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre - cardiac - arrest hypo - or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics , cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) and metabolism ( cmro2 ) , and regional cardiac blood flow during cpr subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation .    2.692879003101262
after approval by the state animal investigation committee , 29 mechanically ventilated , anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled UNK technique .    2.668567247301004
the animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups : in group i ( n = 9 ) blood glucose was not manipulated ; in group ii ( n = 10 ) blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40 % glucose to 319 + / - 13 mg / dl ; in group iii ( n = 10 ) blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to 34 + / - 2 mg / dl .    3.399118800777976
after 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest , cpr ( chest UNK / ventilator ( UNK ) and epinephrine infusion ) was UNK and continued for 8 min .    3.4822214095977104
thereafter , defibrillation was attempted , and if successful , the animals were observed for another 240 min .    3.172872603924424
cerebral perfusion pressure ( cpp ) , cbf , cmro2 , coronary perfusion pressure ( corpp ) , and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control , after 3 min of cpr , and at 10 , 30 , and 240 min post - cpr .    3.2533008410246675
in group i , 4 / 9 animals ( 44 % ) could be successfully resuscitated ; in group ii 4 / 10 ( 40 % ) ; and in group iii 0 / 10 ( 0 % ) .    3.543599143385339
prior to cardiac arrest , mean arterial pressure , cpp , and corpp in group iii were significantly lower compared to groups i and ii .    3.1880370046554303
in group i , cpp during cpr was 26 + / - 6 mmhg ; cbf 31 + / - 9 ml / min / 100 g cmro2 3 . 8 + / - 1 . 2 ml / min / 100 g ; corpp 18 + / - 5 mmhg ; and left ventricular ( lv ) flow 35 + / - 15 ml / min / 100 g . in group ii : cpp = 21 + / - 5 ; cbf 21 + / - 7 ; cmro2 1 . 8 + / - 0 . 8 ; corpp 16 + / - 6 ; and lv flow 22 + / - 9 ; and in group iii : cpp 15 + / - 3 ; cbf 11 + / - 8 ; cmro2 1 . 5 + / - 1 . 1 ; corpp 4 + / - 2 ; and lv flow 19 + / - 10 .    3.558557027316048
during the 240 - min post - resuscitation period , there were no differences in cbf , cmro2 , or lv flow between groups i and ii .    2.8547173940601276
hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome , whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair UNK compared to normoglycaemia .    3.25806664553498
in addition , hyperglycaemia did not affect lv flow , cbf , or cmro2 .    2.72369184174336
however , it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain , which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia .    3.656731332444132
abstract we present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of UNK UNK type i ( ga1 ) .    4.040835596952932
normal urinary organic acids in patients with non - specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely , and no further investigations are required .    3.953862117328244
in other patients , the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical , neuroradiological and biochemical findings .    4.107377237429989
UNK enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom ga1 is very likely .    3.3732591423982217
this article gives a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the nineteenth century up to our own time .    3.1009485474785525
malignant lymphomas , originating from peripheral t or nk cells , are rare tumours in europe and account for less than 10 % of all malignant lymphomas .    3.5210024578034176
in this review , the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from t or nk cells will be presented .    2.655889283989556
nasal nk / t cell lymphoma is mainly found in the nose and paranasal sinuses and often , but not always , display an UNK growth pattern leading to coagulation necrosis .    3.41360129438477
the tumor cells consistently express cd56 , UNK and the UNK molecules encoded by the epstein - barr virus .    3.497090776881952
clonal t cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating , in the majority of cases , a UNK of these tumors from nk cells .    3.7996416558173203
UNK - type intestinal t - cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis .    3.8073279463742207
the tumour cells express t cell antigens , UNK and cytotoxic molecules , but are negative for cd4 .    3.699528461328738
approximately 20 % of the cases display cd56 mostly in combination with cd8 .    4.032383801797717
recently , an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified .    3.140328025279224
histologically these cases resemble celiac disease , however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent cd8 and t - cell - receptor protein expression , and , they are clonal by molecular analysis .    3.206705407783768
clinically , the patients suffer from refractory UNK or ulcerative UNK .    2.7841341325745996
the prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour - forming t - cell lymphoma .    3.156113399827106
angioimmunoblastic t - cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings ( atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale UNK , arborizing high endothelial venules and large UNK - UNK ) as well as clinical features ( systemic symptoms , signs of a UNK immune response ) .    3.5944331093002764
peripheral t - cell lymphomas , that do not fit into a distinct entity , are classified in the real and the new who classifications as peripheral t - cell lymphomas UNK .    3.2123402024682295
these display a broad morphological spectrum ( including the t - cell lymphomas of different cell sizes , UNK ' s lymphoma and t - zone lymphoma of the kiel - classification ) and in general are clinically aggressive .    3.5485778410406854
causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand .    3.3080222393051613
since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases , the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions .    3.361992527277734
a central role is played by the active - passive difference and its UNK UNK .    3.318423134193719
the difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions .    2.867217492516501
at the same time , knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system .    2.976185688805588
isolated severe head trauma ( sht ) or sht in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents .    3.7718601581005666
the prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage .    3.341340755171928
causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in UNK , as well as inflammatory processes .    3.8422270805809666
both isolated sht and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure ( mof ) .    3.283661990750175
often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances , but in combination or UNK they may be lethal .    3.6147461538181704
the hypermetabolism after sht is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis .    3.4923799802369246
in contrast to the consequences of sht for the whole organism , multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions , such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis .    3.2463280497492533
moreover , coagulation , metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of sirs as well .    3.451378968499786
our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited .    3.2286262699983608
in this context , the effects of secondary surgical interventions which may additionally stress a traumatized body have to be considered and are the subject for actual clinical discussions and experimental studies .    3.2108860970113637
this article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic .    2.7534295024830713
background : chronic cough and thoracic pain , commonly caused by upper airway infections , are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics .    2.8663423417281386
these " benign " symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders .    2.9828616877461824
methods : in two patients ( male , age 41 / 12 and 43 / 12 years ) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm ( pleuropulmonary blastoma ) .    3.1730865518398343
results : pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis .    3.1669110118847423
an incomplete resection was performed in both cases .    4.4056265912846255
both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy .    2.9843718739866505
one boy died , the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease .    3.7204279149958155
conclusion : our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy ( adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy ) can provide a long term remission .    2.942746407266929
in 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study .    3.3250170531204346
in the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers ( mean + / - sd : 3 . 9 + / - 1 . 2 °c ) could be found after relaxation hypnosis .    3.7653644676307376
in the second step six patients ( study group ) gained experience with autogenic training .    2.9530018799382987
in the study group , the skin temperature of the fingers ( short - term effect ) was significantly higher than in the control group ( 1 . 9 + / - 1 . 0 °c ) .    3.669162255631063
long - term effects of the autogenic training ( mean acral UNK time , duration and course of the raynaud attacks , acral lesions of the hands , psychosomatic status of complaints , type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease ) were not found within the relatively short follow - up period of 4 months .    3.558405557297804
in our patients UNK and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the UNK .    3.7237076410537493
as far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned , the patients could be assessed as almost adapted .    3.813624287490713
hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis .    3.2127622095081314
abstract the term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( UNK ) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea , cough , and count or UNK of UNK .    3.6334947095913575
the management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management , hospital management or intensive care treatment .    3.2893340119116514
cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors .    3.7844502565697744
the first - line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug - treatment with 2 - agonists and UNK .    3.3042709420423404
systemic steroids as a short - term course are advocated if hospital - treatment is necessary .    3.6447491250626314
however , a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state .    3.524673919648019
antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present .    3.295429985054447
the severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms .    3.6819992486532955
this should be borne in mind for the choice of the UNK treatment .    3.554449890177641
noninvasive ventilation in severe exacerbation is able to improve gas - exchange and to reduce the work of breathing .    3.633048528763942
as a consequence the number of UNK and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced .    3.7644353402749013
if invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary , the potential of dynamic UNK in acute exacerbation has to be considered .    3.744011546601886
background : in 1986 prof . h . UNK ( university of essen pediatrics department ) , supported by prof . g . UNK ( mayo medical school , UNK ) , introduced a 4 - weeks clinical skills lab for all students ( annual class 250 ) , based on self - instruction by means of computer - assisted , interactive , UNK learning materials , models , bedside teaching and UNK on special topics ( partially peer - guided ) .    3.3271255942480975
each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching .    3.191580472747166
the peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills .    2.934193789939352
each UNK is active during 4 - 5 skills lab periods , and in each period he / she UNK two groups of two students each .    3.478003998201649
during the bedside teaching phase each group examines and presents four patients .    2.7991501081671504
spinal injuries referring to UNK falls are common injuries in elderly persons .    3.2856795550163302
up to 55 years of age spinal fractures are more frequent in men while its opposite in older persons .    3.4756772791656476
there are two typical lesions : odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine .    2.9257080996355547
odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly .    4.128331818934132
this is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine ' s stiffness in old age .    2.6936581378023035
instable fractures in extension type ii are most common .    3.557627094175364
in many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x - ray .    3.1597472741850248
conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type iii while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with halo fixateur e . g . we think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation .    3.2690831134174827
because of rare symptoms thoracolumbar fractures in osteoporosis are hidden frequently .    2.984435692776156
in many cases it ' s not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions .    2.929633417874445
therefore there are just few compression fractures ( a type ) that have to be treated operatively .    3.7136752213834097
instable lesions type b and c must be operated as well in the elderly as in the young .    3.9634982913075087
because of low bone mass in elderly the dorsal instrumentation should include more than just the two injured segments .    2.9653855478097677
an even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement .    3.119391056441644
therapy was effected twice a day for approximately 2 months , utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy .    3.304569871437407
before and after rehabilitation , acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer - supported measuring systems : ( 1 ) the " multidimensional voice program " ( kay UNK UNK . ) and ( 2 ) a novel software program developed in göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands .    3.2803084186669103
acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus UNK compensatory phonation .    3.1273533175054458
findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation .    3.0916772931049916
a further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us .    3.4392366686878866
in contrast to analogous parameters of other methods , this approach is independent of the exact UNK of the glottal excitation function , thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with UNK or heavily UNK voices .    3.494181113410183
aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment .    3.5854126338540535
following conservative treatment , incomplete immobilisation or an UNK bone fragment can be causal .    3.393149927678989
after plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing .    3.05612425665999
there are two broad types of pseudarthrosis : vascular and UNK .    2.7397689577553086
the extent of UNK can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as x - ray .    3.942047889114922
the treatment of vascular nonunions is very common .    3.2323136337274168
mechanical stability is required , therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable .    3.6769319597398513
osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications .    3.379324033938343
much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and UNK pseudarthrosis , particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance .    3.971485896434355
these defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula - to - tibia operation .    3.664147027763579
extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions .    3.819652988578785
former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication .    4.541796792092078
stability and immobilisation are necessary .    3.774354280355026
treatment in the low - frequency magnetic field shows no effect .    3.453492642011096
correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location , quality of bone and UNK can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis .    3.711184362596591
aim of the study : the goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in 10 year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of 500 - UNK g . in addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied .    2.941330303800014
background : although the majority of surgeons regard hartmann ' s operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years .    3.1453478613469565
advocates of one - stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results ( high morbidity and mortality ) and long - term outcome ( low rates of intestinal restoration ) .    3.603685809281172
the aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after hartmann ' s operation justify this criticism .    2.3796744425124357
method : from 1982 to 1997 hartmann ' s operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations .    3.330693070086638
in 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications .    3.485174255502135
the average UNK peritonitis index ( UNK ) was 19 .    3.897309225491419
seventeen patients died postoperatively ( mortality : 16 . 5 % ) .    3.0592758065900347
on follow - up , patients were asked to give information on their general state , changes of UNK , abdominal complaints , and quality of life .    3.7620897297323155
results : data on 93 % of patients could be obtained .    3.5965458014668585
the median follow - up time was 75 months .    3.0044460002919986
eleven patients had died ; the remaining 72 were investigated .    3.3051424005166408
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good ; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity .    2.822518205056307
quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored .    3.351292196968235
anastomotic strictures developed in 7 % of cases , always after UNK anastomosis .    3.653989305192367
conclusions : according to our results , long - term outcome after hartmann ' s operation is good .    3.387208827458199
80 % of patients underwent intestinal restoration with low morbidity ( 6 % ) and no mortality .    4.184879833540306
a great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good : this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity .    3.023498075416756
tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and , hence , are often overlooked .    3.350585779773584
clinical examination and ct scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion , whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the " gait laboratory . "    3.612478785057516
only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints .    3.690048950756277
the aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless , mentally ill subjects in munich take advantage of available psychosocial services .    2.4594966172095654
to obtain a representative picture of the situation , the first step was to ascertain how many people in munich are actually homeless .    3.402027179559176
the next step was to ascertain what proportion of them are in need of psychotherapy .    3.1469536214528953
using the standardized diagnostic interview schedule ( dis ) , 146 men and 32 women were interviewed .    2.8209895303904697
the results according to the dsm - iii demonstrated high lifelong and 6 - month prevalence of psychic disturbances .    3.4873623987222135
medical and social services were often UNK , but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations .    3.462384923061303
women were treated more often than men .    3.3647500479879002
elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients ' seeking help .    3.3211775166003963
despite a high prevalence of UNK disease , alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted .    3.3165424058123736
the increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help .    3.171381220465157
most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety .    3.2435240036682655
by means of logistic regression models , predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed .    3.187435811786799
continued treatment occurs only rarely .    3.229840895990992
electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long qt - syndrome .    3.6488379792632997
in borderline electrocardiographic findings associated with unclear syncope , it is often difficult to ensure or exclude long qt - syndrome .    3.1771315118909866
UNK and UNK therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making .    3.102824534513186
in recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long - qt assessment .    3.073723376289028
aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long qt - disorder , it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long qt - syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long - qt family members .    3.6914040345486216
performing linkage analysis , coupling of autosomal - dominant congenital long qt - syndrome ( UNK - ward syndrome ) to chromosomes 11 ( UNK / UNK . 5 ) , 3 ( UNK / UNK ) , 7 ( UNK / UNK ) , and 4 ( UNK / UNK - 27 ) was demonstrated .    4.490620212052202
more recently , the disease genes in long qt - syndrome 1 , 2 , and 3 could be identified .    3.63367444783008
analysis of the base - pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity .    2.9992674432660973
aside from diagnostic aspects , molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion - channel disorder leading to qt - prolongation and sudden death .    2.6665330329598684
during the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry ( UNK , UNK ) generally delivers UNK low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry .    3.2634812765781156
the aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry ( UNK ) is more precise than applanation tonometry in UNK the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders .    2.917727396059851
the case of a 24 - year - old woman with a plunging ranula is reported .    2.7265239711592986
primarily , the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck , which had developed 3 months previously .    4.145525968078997
the polycystic , firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed .    3.3490298693218645
pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula .    3.1994789695088977
the etiology , pathogenesis , clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described .    2.827920553625268
various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value .    3.9803696798355563
we prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis .    3.6635559798985216
the plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland ; therefore , its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences .    3.133193564706595
in extensive cases , the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised .    3.559815358872957
cranial dural fistulae are rare ; when they occur , it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage .    3.673579129633295
with a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery .    3.149888133609216
the examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw - doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination .    2.9950105080784724
sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as UNK .    3.615706815884507
in all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected .    3.326523046871174
in most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery , and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery , in addition .    3.654022114626306
a possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw - doppler sonography , but not for colour coded duplex sonography .    3.001470842172459
therefore , cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect doppler sonographic criteria using cw - doppler and duplex sonography .    3.036705463465559
direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography , in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed .    3.751628313869593
background : echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease .    3.3374238816643746
the good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects .    3.6377732482618144
dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant UNK are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies .    3.1486504530057124
in germany , as in all industrial nations , there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer - related mortality .    3.2578683539272433
cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all .    3.3281424525456123
pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family .    3.63518848891209
although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy , in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians .    3.500644983761544
this work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine .    3.2405916485217174
this retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their UNK acl .    3.871336047375312
the follow - up time was 30 months on average ( range 10 - 54 months ) .    2.8180622026415643
the follow - up examination included subjective ( lysholm score , tegner activity level rating score ) , clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the kt - 1000 UNK .    2.914814617300198
the overall evaluation was done according to the ikdc score .    3.2563447146021853
the follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on acl .    3.090126348990003
the ikdc score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results , which demonstrated that revision acl surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery .    2.856342024182967
nevertheless , we recommend reconstruction of a torn acl even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration .    3.2233019050484617
nowadays , restorative proctocolectomy is considered the " gold standard " in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis .    3.376867460064504
alternative procedures such as brooke ileostomy or UNK pouch are limited to special indications .    3.173622476120172
preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch , but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life .    2.9346471138393726
quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure .    3.067346201282909
quality of life can only be assessed by standardized and validated quality - of - life questionnaires .    3.6006404980289433
preoperatively , patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life , depending on the intensity of their disease .    3.4183521044254026
proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life .    3.2824809456929134
when evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy .    3.6032663370403473
the advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical UNK .    3.2100755933650995
the " total quality - of - life index " is not UNK .    3.132944914121406
preoperatively , patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures .    3.248222401709754
decreased quality - of - life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time .    3.092476837358358
in some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems .    3.4162779971843875
on the other hand , patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls .    3.0201680621919667
preoperatively , patients should be aware of this risk - benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy .    3.0026827676978782
the joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by UNK et al .    2.823165428322287
( 1993 ) were converted into a pelvic reference system , based on UNK gait analysis .    3.3254608654396756
in eight cadaveric hip joints ( age 18 - 75 yrs . )    3.239674847983727
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle ( heel UNK , mid - stance , heel off , toe off ) and the pressure distribution determined with fuji pressure sensitive film .    3.094705262173053
we found maxima of 10 mpa during mid stance .    2.9094542087213964
the areas of highest pressure were located in the UNK - superior aspect of the acetabulum ( anterior part of the acetabular roof ) and in the UNK - inferior aspect of the lunate surface .    5.115465836721196
the pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load .    2.896017243425699
the normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological UNK of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum .    4.585256896024282
during operative interventions this normal load transfer should be restored as accurately as possible .    2.6713943858569817
in spite of its serious sequelae , volatile substance abuse ( UNK ) UNK very little public attention in germany .    3.4167456873031727
our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes .    2.6922535893670605
initially , he achieved short - lived euphoria and hallucinations .    2.7169678572371887
he compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage , finally consuming 5 UNK of fluid propane daily .    2.9918796376507157
getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane .    3.1137570075607988
since he abused the propane in an UNK house , he also exposed third UNK to the danger of explosion .    3.4650319468310506
clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation , restricted UNK and concentration , reduced UNK performance , and psychomotor agitation .    3.0625342595270033
all these symptoms diminished during a 6 - month follow - up .    3.029101948645844
the relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear , since he had also abused alcohol .    2.9242755307509865
objectives the marburg external UNK ( mpt ) fixator is designed to temporarily protect a reconstructed distal extensor apparatus of the knee .    2.853054646605067
it allows an early functional aftercare .    2.7715870375370333
the indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described .    3.4533738748203677
clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children .    3.398558745225734
in specific , well - defined applications , the UNK of ultrasound are promising .    4.36744893662872
sonography provides important additional information to chest x - ray and is even superior to ct under special circumstances .    3.244445601199712
pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional x - ray and more expensive cross - sectional imaging .    3.394783201485101
in the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used .    3.7240178858627333
traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs .    3.044656376480957
the involvement of radiologists has been limited .    3.3903883721362664
in the past few years dedicated ct - software - programs developed to evaluate dental implant patients have provided a new look at the jaws .    2.7654062071568
the complex anatomy is described and identified on human UNK and on axial , panoramic , and cross - sectional images .    3.3797198600802782
with this anatomic description dental - ct - scans are used to demonstrate the anatomy of maxilla and the mandible .    3.558677992402976
an overview of the technique of dental - ct is provided , furthermore the radiation dose of different organs is explained .    3.3972540252538868
suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended UNK are given .    3.2425480639355215
the debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the german - speaking media and in professional publications within recent years .    2.9313765314399105
this discussion , however , largely excluded mentally ill patients .    3.698776697864933
also , euthanasia advocacy groups have usually UNK themselves from euthanasia in psychiatric patients .    2.754150586473473
we report here two cases from our hospital in which in - patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass .    3.0889060617238497
we discuss these events under the assumption that these are cases of questionable active euthanasia in mentally ill patients whose judgement was considerably compromised by their disorder .    2.984225818894677
although critics of autopsies use to put forward ethical objections and religious UNK , neither the christian UNK nor UNK stand opposite to the UNK of autopsies .    3.224354928069543
currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized UNK ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) without loss of echocardiographic quality .    2.9241574350982087
methods : in the present prospective study , the UNK inserted miniaturized tee probe was tested in 12 ventilated patients and compared with a conventional tee probe .    3.9193867648934355
echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection ( < 50 % , 50 - 75 % , 75 - 100 % ) in the left ventricular short - and long - axis views .    3.8055206942134014
results : in 11 patients , more than 50 % of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes .    2.949008402330359
although the nasal tee probe was inferior to conventional tee in detecting lateral endocardium , automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods .    2.769950467191175
inter - and UNK variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross - sectional area was below 5 % on average and differed non - significantly with regard to the method .    4.030732580137427
in 2 patients , continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized tee probe and mucosa .    2.889540491479297
conclusions : in comparison with conventional tee , the miniaturized tee probe provides practicability advantages without significant loss of information for cardiovascular monitoring .    3.1229100817565962
by means of modern color - coded duplex sonography ( ccds ) even very small vessels can be visualized .    2.5648270934348845
maximum resolution nowadays is about 0 . 5 mm diameter of the vessel .    4.3530328211410465
we compared the use of ccds and angiography in studying of acral perfusion .    3.4941071639703885
besides morphologic criteria , hemodynamic criteria were recorded .    3.0604183837136456
arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border .    3.2296871004935523
the physiological maximal blood flow velocity UNK 20 cm / s .    2.948131495904297
ccds revealed UNK of finger arteries as typical finding in UNK obliterans .    3.1990049976863677
segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm / s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis , as proven by angiographic examinations .    3.3266346426293336
ccds is suitable for evaluation of acral perfusion in patients suffering from secondary raynaud ' s syndrome .    3.8722157040102214
apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation , other possible applications of ccds are in in the surgical field , for example UNK in hand or finger surgery .    3.2940601421336098
the discussion of the UNK vs UNK UNK court case in the " american journal of psychiatry " raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression .    3.621530958625008
a summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented .    3.684530869344342
in addition , the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the icd - 10 research criteria study .    3.339665643385666
in the case of one patient with UNK ( icd - 10 UNK : UNK . 1 ) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists .    3.3441897837146537
by contrast , the percentage of clinicians UNK an endogenous etiology and thus , diagnosing a psychosis and starting a UNK was markedly higher among psychiatrists .    3.130665344125429
in conclusion , the integration of different UNK and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists .    3.0815132279862385
for certain patients , an integrated therapy may be more effective .    3.6894881691089267
a 43 - year - old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg , doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery .    3.011937815461952
using the cross - over - approach from the contralateral side , it was possible to UNK a guide wire through the occlusion , and after passage with an excimer laser an ipsilateral retrograde puncture with placement of a sheath was performed .    3.170570958140543
in order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation , a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique .    3.144162487791559
afterwards three stents were placed .    3.726188874656379
subsequently the patient completely improved ; treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results .    2.857969361543242
conclusion : using the kissing balloon technique , laser - assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments .    2.722595286472099
a surgical procedure can thus be avoided .    3.115273471268733
the typical mri features of the most common pancreatic diseases , such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas , have been established .    4.343062663007914
however , even in these common pancreatic disorders , mri correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons .    3.2982632807362378
we emphasize mr - pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes , including pancreatitis , adenocarcinoma , acinar cell carcinoma , rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms , and islet cell tumors .    3.053615412105855
by UNK the correlation of key pathological features with mr findings , a better understanding of the mr appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided .    3.3573396563221465
in addition , mri may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors .    2.6920760733737534
background : the implantation of a femoro - popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro - popliteal region .    2.9371651190294124
application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel , endovascular implantable bypass system .    3.243131664571283
the device is placed within the lumen of the superficial femoral artery .    2.772583550347588
the present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers , with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans .    3.251360697424046
methods : the endopass consists of a thin - wall UNK tube with a total length of 53 cm .    3.2832432925412567
endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision .    3.270128016541646
following antegrade ringstripper - tea , the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire .    3.377749620942482
the proximal anastomosis is performed surgically .    3.0975532425104877
results : the technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities .    3.1965871874060303
implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery .    3.326873121476813
the most important problems included the complete ringstripper - tea , the placement of the guide wire following the tea , and the expansion of the endopass .    3.235403230771576
following approval by the ethics commission , the endopass was implanted in five patients between june 1997 and march 1998 .    3.2612585228312625
in three patients , the endopass remained patent and has UNK well .    3.69660236856519
one patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early UNK occlusion , while in the remaining case , perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to UNK the attempt .    3.445627913224338
conclusion : experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method .    3.067845576225091
further development and methodological improvement , however , are necessary requiring additional , larger studies on patients .    3.479306418905849
introduction : there is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells .    3.40348064410455
therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed UNK potassium current were investigated .    3.241236447418575
in order to evaluate patients ' exposure to radiation in computed tomography , dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index ( ctdi ) , multiple scan average dose ( msad ) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used .    2.8503516152662853
the ctdi and the msad , UNK from the ctdi , are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume , but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors .    3.3286961623012763
the dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk .    3.021621906128983
the UNK of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account , in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side .    3.4816686314917047
prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades .    3.628539216795211
due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death , autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters .    3.224813467107209
the present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in UNK consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery .    3.328947512295643
the diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability , baroreflex sensitivity , and more traditional markers such as non - sustained ventricular tachycardia , left ventricular ejection fraction , and ventricular late potentials .    3.0501927471839365
patiens were followed for a mean of 33 + / - 21 months .    4.4292666200908855
stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function , both autonomic markers , and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint , i . e . , all - cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events .    3.056855350475206
with respect to the secondary endpoint ( ventricular tachyarrhythmic events ) , left ventricular function , heart rate variability , and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors .    3.0754970192614537
ventricular late potentials and UNK ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events .    3.232488280960399
these findings from a large prospective long - term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death .    3.2346618075590325
k + channels and UNK of drugs : implications for drug toxicity assessment - the time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the qt interval of the ecg and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed UNK k + current ( UNK ) , which consists of a rapid component ( ikr ) and a slow component ( UNK ) .    3.7036210738366324
prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer qt interval on the ecg .    3.0632671689223683
during prolonged aps , increased UNK currents induce early UNK , which increase the risk of UNK de UNK ( tdp ) cardiac arrhythmias .    3.5457168688541065
tdp arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent UNK of the electrical axis around the UNK line .    4.130806589752853
it has a rate of 150 to 250 beats / min and it can occasionally UNK into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal .    3.489858922587885
the incidence of drug - induced tdp arrhythmias is highest among class ia and class iii antiarrhythmic agents .    2.9716817610595454
however , under certain clinical conditions , also several non - cardiovascular medicinal products induce qt interval UNK in the ecg or tdp arrhythmias .    3.181570351534585
since all drugs known to cause tdp block ikr , an early evaluation of possible effects on aps of cardiac myocytes expressing ikr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended .    3.11552130713087
if in - vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce ap prolongation and / or k + channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations , either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to tdp arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies .    3.393327475637654
carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of UNK prognosis if not adequately treated .    3.635778230851617
to a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion .    3.849821478157996
in turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival .    3.7140748022956407
in the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication .    2.7756050164862365
if delayed lymphadenectomy is performed , the survival rate is reduced by approximately 50 % as compared to the results of immediate lymphadenectomy .    3.881935139767787
the modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by UNK leads to less complications .    3.3023470730632005
if performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer .    3.7175354894286237
recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant UNK may further enhance the survival .    3.0801973313436832
on the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the 5 axes of the opd diagnosis , a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented .    3.2219115204358832
the syndrome diagnosis according to icd 10 is completed in a final phase .    3.0351190267617514
this psychodynamic - diagnostic assessment interview is recommended , apart from the use for opd diagnosis , for use a clinical instrument .    3.4992436866946974
cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most frequent forms of meningoencephalitis in aids patients .    3.3752658800902826
before the introduction of UNK antibiotics like difluconazole , the frequency of this meningitis among aids patients was 5 - 10 % , yet declined during the last years .    3.2387380334228526
clinically , nonspecific signs of a meningeal inflammation UNK while focal neurological signs are rare .    3.1967069199833626
rapid institution of high - dose antimycotic therapy is the UNK to improve prognosis and decrease mortality .    4.41115774929659
UNK of choice are amphotericin b , fluconazole , and flucytosin .    3.1035175548653373
diagnosis is established by detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid , microscopic demonstration of cryptococci using UNK - UNK , and cryptococcal cultures .    3.3848159614906517
recent developments aim to improve antimycotic therapies .    3.090546415486632
during the last years , life - long secondary prevention with difluconazole was established .    2.6617999094761853
cryptococci which are resistent against fluconazole and amphotericin b are a special challenge , yet fortunately are rare .    3.0010298288457307
longterm outcome of patients is determined by the progression of the underlying immunsuppression .    4.666219889351215
therefore , combination of secondary prophylaxis with modern UNK substances is important .    3.1656958669680466
clinical decision analysis in patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis is presented using methods from evidence - based medicine .    3.4497642296238484
the effect of aprotinin ( UNK iu as a bolus + UNK UNK / h until the end of the operation ) on transfusion requirements and coagulation parameters in orthotopic liver transplantation ( study group : n = 9 ; placebo group : n = 9 ) was investigated in a randomised , double - blind study .    3.3197796577317655
coagulation parameters were monitored intraoperatively using a mobile laboratory .    3.3759138778934457
in contrast to the published results , no effect on transfusion requirements could be demonstrated .    2.9534967813787993
however , aprotinin showed a positive effect on some coagulation parameters in the reperfusion phase .    3.2821841950573747
the mechanism appeared to be inhibition of the contact activation of the intrinsic system with less thrombin generation in the study group .    3.521956428451617
co - existing inflammation and epidermal UNK characteristic for psoriasis have been shown to be reproducible in several animal models utilizing a variety of different strategies . these models highlight some points of the UNK pathogenesis of psoriasis .    3.5265568332525383
based on observations made in the animal models , a hypothesis is proposed for the pathogenesis of psoriasis , the elements of which can be tested in a recently established UNK transplantation model .    3.66046020872551
adipose tissue tumors are often characterized by typical or even specific chromosomal alterations .    3.300610798076021
in some of the cases the molecular background of these microscopically visible alterations was already elucidated .    2.9987786590123906
in myxoid liposarcomas the translocation t ( 12 ; 16 ) creates a fusion gene between the UNK gene and the UNK gene and in UNK the UNK - c gene becomes UNK by structural aberrations involving chromosomal region UNK - 15 .    3.8274036596656753
based on examples of a lipoma , a well - differentiated liposarcoma , a myxoid liposarcoma , and an aggressive angiomyxoma it is demonstrated in the present paper how cytogenetic investigation can be used as an additional tool for an improved diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors .    3.532054765836705
furthermore , the detection of molecular mechanisms underlying the visible cytogenetic alterations will certainly significantly increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases .    3.3230994568292487
the primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical or endoscopic means .    3.3870543762149627
therefore , image analysis of the larynx should only be performed under knowledge of the results of clinical diagnosis .    4.793039812112454
the anatomic relationships of the laryngeal skeleton , the intrinsic structures , and the surrounding soft tissue are presented UNK .    3.9761794537855586
the pattern erg ( perg ) is used as an indicator of retinal ganglion cell function .    3.171685371688415
up to now , reports on the reproducibility of the perg have been contradictory .    2.6257496390256567
we investigated the reproducibility under the conditions of the forthcoming iscev guidelines for the perg .    3.2088536683494517
we simultaneously recorded the perg and vep in 42 eyes of 21 subjects to phase - reversing UNK stimuli with UNK electrodes .    2.8001521688714255
both transient ( 2 rps ) and steady - state ( 16 rps ) stimulation was employed .    2.9716812440468807
the check sizes were 0 . 4 ° , 0 . 8 ° and 16 ° , the mean UNK 45 cd / m2 , the contrast 98 % , and the field size 32 UNK ° .    4.255153934122522
measurements were repeated at the same time of day after 1 week .    3.1358609366589802
in addition , we compared two different electrode positions in 16 eyes : ( 1 ) across the cornea along the lower lid ; and deep in the conjunctival sac .    2.931566262539877
with position ( 1 ) the amplitudes were found to be higher by 20 % than ( 2 ) .    4.044957115338584
we calculated the coefficient of variation ( cv ) of amplitude as a measure of reproducibility .    2.9679924754669877
cv was 7 + / - 1 % for the steady - state perg , 9 + / - 1 % for the transient perg , 12 + / - 2 % for the steady - state vep and 14 + / - 3 % for the transient vep .    3.5561828038514895
for the latency of the perg , the UNK cv was found to be 1 . 5 % .    4.004653851990587
amplitude reproducibility was somewhat higher under steady - state as compared to transient stimulation ; we attribute this to the high noise rejection of the fourier analysis .    3.3790820625618756
altogether , the amplitude reproducibility of the perg is somewhat higher than that of the vep .    2.9293538765370775
as a result of physical violence to exposed regions of skin ( beating , UNK ) it was possible to effect a mutual transfer of epithelial cells between probands .    2.9950591893877063
the majority of these cells were corneocytes with a minimal incidence of nucleated stratum UNK cells .    2.968901810209656
UNK onto foil - covered UNK resulted in a comparable transfer of cells .    3.266167676826865
UNK afflicted to the upper arms resulted in a successful ` UNK - victim ' assignment via dna typing .    3.3688365087350314
the dna did not only originate from the few nucleated cells but also from the corneocytes themselves , as positively confirmed by investigations of UNK cell - UNK .    2.9179324963659283
the cell concentration achieved in model experiments , however , shows that the forensic value of such a sample is dependent on the presence of nucleated cells .    4.051739838752643
the results of this paper justify the requirement - ( having weighed up the appropriate case - specific modalities ) - that sampling by taking swabs of the skin regions in question must be carried out as soon as possible .    2.960740464379185
ultrasound contrast media increase backscatter from blood thus improving the signal - to - noise - ratio .    3.2658614761177893
potential clinical applications of intravenous ultrasound contrast are reviewed .    3.1955499420235514
contrast enhancement of continous wave doppler is indicated when the native recordings are UNK and no complete envelope of the doppler spectrum is obtained .    3.1939744017972913
in aortic stenosis several investigations showed good agreement between the gradient calculated from doppler measurements and the results of cardiac catheterization .    3.4746061925722564
in mitral insufficiency maximum area of the regurgitant jet is a widely used parameter for estimation of the severity of the regurgitation .    3.2736723562114265
however , assessment of the maximum jet area may be not possible because poor acoustic windows .    3.1415732219522527
contrast enhancement provides complete display of the regurgitant jet in most of the patients .    2.951815446229035
the diagnostic confidence of the doppler investigation is further improved by the recording of the pulmonary venous flow , which can be recorded in most of the patients following injection on contrast .    4.002035822912196
therefore contrast enhanced transthoracic doppler is an alternative to transesophageal doppler investigation in patients with poor transthoracic windows .    3.9295434453301183
since 1993 a report UNK system for fractures of the neck of the femur has been established in the department of external quality assurance of the chamber of physicians of westphalia - lippe .    3.280111007950182
several indicators of good quality have changed significantly since then : conservative treatment decreased from 6 . 8 % in 1993 to 4 . 2 % in 1997 , lethality decreased from 6 . 9 % to 5 . 4 % , average length of stay decreased from 30 . 9 days to 24 . 9 days , average length of stay before operation decreased from 2 . 6 to 2 . 1 days , the frequency of operations on UNK increased , complications in wound healing increased from 4 . 9 to 6 . 0 % , and cardiopulmonary complications decreased from 11 . 2 % to 7 . 8 % .    3.9795762105979096
between 1993 and 1997 , 54 . 3 % were UNK to go home ; the percentage of patients sent to rehabilitation facilities after acute care rose from 8 . 3 % in 1993 to 20 . 1 % in 1997 .    3.724129004452168
the most frequent and still increasing procedure was implantation of UNK / bipolar prosthesis ( from 38 . 8 % in 1993 to 41 . 0 % in 1997 ) followed by total hip replacement ( decreasing from 37 . 4 % in 1993 to 34 . 2 % in 1997 ) .    3.5075660127419166
operative treatment was performed in more than 90 % of all fractures in all counties of westphalia - lippe .    2.8996639319981146
however , there was a wide and significant geographical variation in the choice between osteosynthesis and hip replacement : the percentage of hip replacements differed between 57 % and 82 % among different counties .    2.9437025268118857
average length of stay before the operative procedure for patients undergoing reduction and rigid internal fixation of the fracture is still too long ( 1 . 6 days in 1997 ) .    3.5315544756904433
the etiology of os odontoideum is still controversial .    2.742554300046777
in most patients , it is found by accident because of neurological symptoms and / or painful range of motion of the cervical spine .    3.5348965198246196
upon recognition of the os odontoideum , it is unknown whether or not immediate surgery is beneficial .    4.031875914073448
this is in contrast to an " unstable " os odontoideum , which could result in atlantoaxial instability or compression of the myelon .    3.462420694538464
in this study , we present the results of our treatment of four patients with an unstable os odontoideum .    3.6981911177765836
in all four cases , a c1 - 2 fusion was performed ( 3 x magerl / UNK , 1 gallie - brooks ) .    3.2995164220101945
postoperatively , we found a complete regression of neurological symptoms in three patients and one was significantly improved .    3.7104705812061485
the range of motion of the cervical spine was free of pain in all patients .    3.121273409989542
as a result , we strongly support immediate surgical treatment of an unstable os odontoideum in order to prevent severe and life - threatening neurological complications .    3.6013604304596214
several studies from anglo - american countries indicate that in non - psychiatric hospital departments mentally ill patients have a longer length of hospital stay than mentally well , while in austria and germany , until now , no studies concerning this question exist .    3.369824895239879
based on the clinical interview schedule , 28 . 1 % of the patients in this sample suffered from psychiatric disorders .    3.334858851563802
the presence of psychiatric disorders , as well as type of hospital department ( medical department ) , higher age , more previous non - psychiatric treatment periods , and more somatic diagnoses predicted a longer duration of inpatient treatment .    3.4342441180999996
to avoid the influence of UNK variables , psychiatric cases were matched with psychiatric non - cases .    2.8699847990848153
patients with a diagnosis of dementia or of substance abuse showed a significantly increased length of stay , while we could not confirm this for other psychiatric diagnoses .    3.333164279832214
functional recovery after bilateral comminuted fractures of the humeral head with posterior dislocation is poor .    3.278795769790248
when reposition and internal fixation fail , the remaining alternatives are ( hemi ) arthroplasty and / or arthrodesis .    3.5813005323518508
in a 50 - year - old patient , we treated the dominant shoulder by arthrodesis ; a neer prosthesis was inserted at the other side .    3.094996257615077
using this strategy , the advantages of both techniques were combined with an acceptable functional recovery , which ist especially important for young and active patients .    3.383452682489482
commonly used UNK for gut decontamination after oral ingestion of toxic substances are induced emesis , gastric lavage and activated UNK .    2.9860594252373653
it was not until recently that the effectiveness of these procedures was studied systematically .    3.4046991727419194
the results of these studies are presented and the side effects and complications of the different procedures are discussed .    3.592628708401199
together with the german UNK control centers , guidelines for gut decontamination in pediatric patients were developed , based on the official recommendations of the european association of poisons centres and clinical UNK ( UNK ) and the american UNK of clinical toxicology ( UNK ) .    3.805080302777179
the methodology used to assess postoperative continence has a significant effect on the outcome of incontinence surgery .    3.769755940104521
retrospective chart review studies consistently report higher success rates than patient questionnaire - based outcome analyses .    2.9537113947003766
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the true long - term results of the stamey bladder neck suspension procedure using an anonymous patient questionnaire .    2.716885100879992
of 172 consecutive patients , 138 ( 80 . 2 % ) returned a questionnaire on long - term continence , complications and subjective satisfaction with the operative result .    3.7593778325093763
with a mean follow - up of 66 months , 65 of 130 evaluable patients ( 50 . 0 % ) remained completely continent while 15 ( 11 . 5 % ) never became continent and 50 ( 38 . 5 % ) had recurrent incontinence 6 - 90 months postoperatively .    3.441672398112327
almost two - thirds of the patients felt either cured or substantially improved more than 5 years after surgery .    3.4721547784416473
stamey bladder neck suspension leads to a persistently improved quality of life despite a considerable failure rate .    3.850063580055408
our study demonstrates the advantages of patient questionnaires for outcome analyses and emphasizes the need for standardisation and validation to allow comparisons between the results of different incontinence procedure in the future .    3.340781010377196
social work for the elderly in a UNK ageing society is not justified per se , but has to prove its utility under the altering social conditions of the changing age - structure .    3.5336408812208173
in the field of practice , this has led to an increasing need for professional orientation and to UNK for profiles of performance with greater UNK .    3.4508751441459373
pseudoaneurysms bear an increased risk of arterio - arterial embolism .    3.544384709457746
treatment of pseudoaneurysms is influenced by the location and the type of injury , associated UNK , collaterals to the ipsilateral hemisphere , neurological signs and symptoms , growth of the lesion and patient age .    3.4167711197352726
potential treatment regimen include conservative and medical approaches with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy , extra - intracranial bypass , resection of the pseudoaneurysm with vessel reconstruction , ligation or endovascular balloon occlusion of the ica .    3.06029150442598
pseudoaneurysms of the ica adjacent to the UNK base require a major surgical procedure .    3.5689464697215105
if there are contraindications for vessel occlusion conservative or medical treatment used to be the only therapeutic alternatives .    3.5164414536587287
we report the treatment of two patients with extracranial ica pseudoaneurysms after blunt injury with stent placement ( in one case combined with coil embolization ) as a further treatment option .    3.7639328753061263
introduction : the combination of direct magnification mammography and computed radiography provides an improvement in spatial resolution of storage phosphor - based digital systems .    3.0969311870563745
a clinical study comparing conventional and digital direct magnification mammograms was performed .    3.125511793567868
an intraindividual comparison of these with previous conventional radiograms of the same patients was carried out .    3.370083706209957
results : the diagnostic value of digital survey mammograms using the direct magnification technique is comparable to that of conventional radiograms of the breast , especially with regard to the identification of microcalcifications and lesions and the clinical consequences .    3.354276592508794
spot magnification views performed with this combination of techniques allowed improvement in the evaluation of microcalcifications .    3.8279529704982553
conclusion : the combination of the direct magnification technique with digital storage phosphor radiography systems allows the performance of digital mammography by improving the overall spatial resolution .    2.91096682381312
the diagnostic value of digital direct magnification survey mammograms was comparable to that of conventional mammograms .    2.6970812967794666
digital 4 - fold spot magnification views improved visualisation of the morphologic aspects of microcalcifications .    2.8835900153764773
warthin ' s tumour of the larynx is an unusual finding .    3.4327925449576817
in present literature only four cases have been reported .    3.108325461259525
only one case of a woman suffering from warthin ' s tumour of the UNK gland and the ipsilateral site of the larynx has been published .    3.7578680618821925
the theories about the development of warthin ' s tumours are discussed .    3.690529755653653
in rheumatic diseases , radiation synovectomy is a reliable method .    3.4994283291039974
meanwhile , radiation synovectomy is an outpatient therapy .    3.1152165235054254
in addition , combination with arthroscopic synovectomy is an increasing therapeutic modality .    2.790002256355604
in comparison to the hitherto inpatient modality , a greater lymphatic emigration of the radionuclide and , therefore , a higher radiation exposure is possible .    3.303213852170064
in 35 patients we found radionuclide emigration in 17 cases by whole body scintigraphy , resulting in a 50 % - percentile with 68 . 27 % - confidence interval of 1 . 8 ( 0 . 45 - 4 . 78 ) % of the injected UNK - 90 - activity .    3.7894865871760297
comparison of 3 groups with the above mentioned therapy modalitites resulted in no statistical difference ( p > 0 . 05 ) .    2.7082567086521365
because of the found radionuclide emigration , a radiation dose of 0 . 1 ( 0 . 05 - 0 , 18 ) msv in women and 0 . 2 ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 38 ) msv in men was calculated .    4.108201152072059
for lymph nodes , liver , spleen and whole body radiation doses of UNK ( 154 - UNK ) msv , 62 ( 15 - 165 ) msv , 62 ( 15 - 165 ) msv and 37 ( 9 - 99 ) msv were calculated .    2.7635916562726393
gonadal radiation dose can be neglected and the morbidity rate for tumors UNK of the whole body radiation dose is low with a value of 0 . 4 per UNK .    4.0837795916423225
therefore , radiation synovectomy can be used unlimited by patients age and independent of the therapeutic modality .    3.8364355052103405
the goal of surgery using a thoracoscopic approach for the anterior reconstruction of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is the reduction of postoperative pain and morbidity .    3.50566135612309
fusion of the injured segment was performed by partial corporectomy and the vertebral body reconstructed using a tricortical autogenous bone graft .    3.5636867944197412
a plate and screw assembly was inserted to stabilize the surgical correction .    3.1926114583793526
this technique was used between may 1996 on may 1998 in 100 patients with 103 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine .    3.1134800742067807
fractures from t4 to l3 were stabilized ; most fractures occurred at the thoracolumbar junction .    3.0270382935277933
a UNK short fusion was given preference in 51 patients .    2.8175516478119604
a UNK approach was necessary in 68 patients on account of the fracture type .    3.8203159603978927
comparing a group of 30 patients who had undergone an open procedure and a similar group treated under thoracoscopic assistance , we found a marked reduction of the postoperative need for analgesics and the duration of postoperative ventilation .    4.0028410145210715
UNK external counterpulsation operates by applying ecg - triggered diastolic pressure via UNK to the vascular bed of the lower limbs .    3.29018126157285
comparable with intra - aortic balloon UNK , pecp produces a diastolic augmentation combined with increase of mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion .    2.9290138358806748
american , asian , and our own data demonstrated a reduction of angina pectoris through repeated use of pecp one or two hours daily for four to seven weeks .    3.3132670535676656
exercise testing and thallium scanning confirmed the clinical improvement .    3.1557163482583652
pecp is a virtually UNK treatment option in patients suffering from angina despite medical and UNK treatment .    3.5597662189667014
opening of collaterals and collateral growth induced by external counterpulsation are discussed as the cause of clinical benefit .    3.7403823700184944
transrectal fine - needle aspiration biopsy ( fnab ) of the prostate under digital control is a cheap and rapid method for diagnostic evaluation of palpable and non - palpable nodules , yielding high sensitivity ( ca .    3.407348032214013
95 % ) and a low complication rate ( < 1 % ) .    4.170016402469606
its specificity amounts to > 97 % .    3.045898484010982
the UNK of urologists trained in the fnab method and of pathologists experienced in cytology of the prostate limit the clinical application so far .    3.1840618119438706
besides various forms of prostatitis , five different types of cancer can cytologically be differentiated .    3.4054232345527673
while pin i cannot be cytologically identified , pin ii / iii lesions may lead to false - positive diagnoses .    3.0918186846744513
cytologic grading of adenocarcinomas of the prostate is of statistically proven prognostic validity and strictly correlated with its histologic UNK .    3.10468386236568
preoperative , radiologically controlled fnab of pelvic and paraortal lymph nodes has sensitivity of ca .    2.8970191733631605
86 % and specificity of 100 % .    3.209041292843973
it thus helps to avoid unnecessary prostatectomies if nodal tumor spread has preoperatively been proven .    2.9107310846968684
diagnostic dna cytometry is able to identify those prostatic cancer patients who do not reveal significantly increased risk of tumor progression or decreased survival probability , even without therapy ( constantly and UNK diploid and UNK patterns ) .    3.291368013597806
patients with dna UNK histograms may show detoriation of prognosis under hormonal therapy .    2.712182958162709
dna - aneuploid prostatic cancers should not be subjected to a " wait and see " strategy ; they do not respond to hormonal therapy .    3.082591574880289
early defibrillation is the standard of care for patients with ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) .    3.217200313661393
technical developments aim at further miniaturization and simplification of defibrillators as well as adaptation of energy requirements to the patient ' s needs .    3.8700317993953397
implantable cardioverter - defibrillators ( icd ) and automated external defibrillators ( UNK ) are based upon the same technology .    3.4827799456628874
use of automated devices is the prerequisite for defibrillation by non - physicians .    3.1502966037368294
chest impedance measurements and use of alternative shock waveforms , such as biphasic , aim at adaptation of energy or current to the patient ' s individual needs and avoid application of unnecessarily high amounts of energy to the myocardium .    3.2386616350019466
calculation of median frequency is a non - invasive method for analyzing the heart ' s metabolic and electrical state .    3.2833329447745685
it helps to determine the optimal moment for defibrillation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) .    2.837806661507056
developments concerning the structure of in - hospital emergency systems or pre - hospital emergency medical services ( ems ) aim at further reductions in time from collapse of a patient until first defibrillation .    3.4684167280107085
such developments include early defibrillation programs for emergency medical technicians ( emt ) , nurses , and fire or police department first responders as well as wide distribution of easy - to - operate defibrillators in public areas , as discussed during the american heart association ' s public access defibrillation conferences .    3.0043084496570094
all programs of that kind have to be organized and supervised by a physician who is responsible for training and supervision of the personnel involved .    3.4147003539578384
spontaneous breathing with biphasic positive airway pressure ( bipap ) or airway pressure release ventilation ( aprv ) caused a reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and dead space ventilation and improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome .    3.3264084903048032
in patients early spontaneous breathing with aprv / bipap was associated with a better arterial oxygenation than in patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for 3 days and were then weaned with aprv / bipap .    2.893855751537021
length of mechanical ventilation , intubation and icu stay was shorter in patients breathing spontaneously early with aprv / bipap .    2.9610928376951438
therefore , early spontaneous breathing with aprv / bipap may be of advantage .    2.7442566938285324
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder ( rbd ) is a rare but clinically distinct disorder which is easily overlooked .    3.099719389906844
it commonly occurs in older men and , because of its similarity to epileptic seizures , is often misdiagnosed .    3.6574510868161525
the etiology of rbd is still unknown .    2.7514053652244126
however , there is an interesting association with parkinson ' s disease which presents some pathophysiological hypotheses .    3.13263844972138
treatment is usually successful with UNK .    3.3803526428628645
various therapeutic options have been proposed in the treatment of femoral head necrosis ranging from conservative management to total hip arthroplasty .    3.411503903248777
since microsurgical techniques are routinely used in orthopaedic surgery , the importance of revascularization has increased in recent years .    3.354792087927161
vascularized bone grafting as well as various osteotomies have been considered for the stages ii and iii according to ficat and ii , iii and iv of the criteria of the arco system respectively , which also bases on mri - findings .    3.0703739260948617
we investigated the results of 80 patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head treated with a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft , perfused by the a . circumflexa UNK UNK , between 1988 and 1996 .    3.634508024962734
mean follow - up was 5 , 6 years .    3.423971483244518
the evaluation was based on the harris hip score , clinical and radiological examination as well as a subjective assessment using a vas ( visual analog scale ) .    3.4308967285399867
the clinical results according to the harris hip score were good or excellent in 86 , 1 % .    3.175292000726914
these results correlate with the subjective assessment of pain and of the hip joint function with an average of 7 , 9 points using the vas ( max .    4.1456378213494585
unchanged radiological appearance over the follow - up period was observed in 47 , 5 % using the arco criterias .    4.164399860712769
reviewing the studies using vascularized grafts , about 50 % of the patients with a stage ii and iii according to ficat and ii , iii and iv of the arco respectively show an unchanged stage of the disease 5 - 6 years after the procedure .    3.3042418821860955
therefore , transplantation of a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft possibly offers the chance to UNK causally in the course of the disease with only little alteration of the biomechanics of the hip joint .    2.9371811829940597
this paper describes preprosthetic surgery from its historical UNK to its present state - of - the - art status .    2.7365289394212007
future perspectives of preprosthetic surgery are also outlined , excluding implants .    3.065606837265724
in an enquiry of 250 german - speaking maxillofacial departments , 160 responded .    2.9435148181594313
results showed that a surprising 30 - 50 % of the institutions are still following guidelines for procedures which have been proven by scientific follow - up studies to be almost 100 % unsuccessful .    3.8232271723717375
this paper summarizes the results of an attempt to reconstruct the UNK of jewish pediatricians from germany , vienna and the german pediatric hospitals in prague between 1933 and 1945 .    3.6117699478830203
the relevant UNK in europe , usa , great britain and israel provided facts and relevant dates for 697 jewish pediatricians who were UNK and UNK or who emigrated .    3.3166485591031116
compared with the total number of UNK pediatric specialists in the three areas , more than 50 % of them were jews as defined by the nazi UNK laws .    3.885261538635746
so far , UNK cases have been cleared up : UNK of them emigrated to 31 countries ; 63 became victims of the holocaust ; other individual UNK included going UNK or UNK suicide .    3.2526669447730683
the fate of about 120 persons is still unknown .    3.0865533713299844
this paper discusses the probable reasons for the high percentage of jews in pediatrics , the anti - UNK attitude of the german society for pediatrics and the UNK UNK and UNK of jewish pediatricians in the nazi period .    3.870149023019042
we performed a prospective multi - center study in order to determine the causes of 30 - day perioperative mortality .    3.7372534015833265
the implantation of a mesh is an essential step in laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery .    3.239956663791598
we present the case of a 22 - year - old man who developed an unspecific and refractory syndrome of inguinal pain after a tapp procedure for a primary inguinal hernia .    2.8584851197427406
repeated reoperation for UNK of clips and nerve transection were unsuccessful .    3.2683826381148666
by a transinguinal approach , 18 months after the first operation we removed a preperitoneal UNK mesh which had UNK and UNK to 30 % of its original size .    3.8779277539075476
the problem of biocompatibility of UNK currently used in inguinal hernia surgery is discussed .    2.899435233327842
therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma remains difficult .    3.1856505599829203
new therapeutic schemes besides cytokine treatment should be evaluated .    3.203630929484373
the following study analyzes the in vitro toxicity of treosulfan on spheroids of 8 primary cultures of renal cell carcinoma cells .    3.056576216405742
these data were compared to the toxicity of vinblastine .    3.2791633123877992
all investigations were performed in regard to the p - glycoprotein ( pgp ) expression of the cells , which is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance .    3.9081286061598224
four pgp positive and four pgp negative spheroids were incubated with the drugs in increasing doses .    3.0629805885294537
significantly higher toxicity of treosulfan compared to vinblastine could be demonstrated .    2.9148627875215922
in addition , the effects of treosulfan were not related to pgp expression .    3.153571798956435
these results are encouraging and a phase ii study analyzing the efficacy of treosulfan in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma has been initiated in our institution .    3.557585413815786
postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy renders beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids .    3.2041743272585603
additionally , direct protective mechanisms of estrogens in the blood vessels and myocardium are under study .    3.249621667389165
recent findings suggest an improvement in endothelium - dependent vasodilatation and coronary microcirculation .    3.420052782505016
furthermore , it has also been suggested that this treatment has UNK effects on the left ventricular geometry , i . e . , UNK left ventricular mass and wall thickness .    3.7231631230593196
whether the beneficial effects of estrogens are UNK by a combined use with UNK is not yet known and requires further investigation .    3.8203617621230266
malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide .    3.5861365076748593
characteristic signs of malaria are special macroscopic and microscopic organ changes , which may also be seen in postmortem examinations .    3.6198799962929966
modern diagnostic tools allow a fast and reliable diagnosis .    3.2377712373825682
the symptoms of malaria are rather unspecific , so the correct diagnosis may be difficult , especially if the doctor is not informed about the patient having been abroad .    3.247477072689577
the cases presented also point out possible legal consequences of a missed diagnosis .    2.973864874175835
prognostically relevant factors based on the histological assessment of the resected pancreas are known .    4.280508162660469
however , additional parameters , such as biological staging of the intrinsic malignant UNK of the tumor , would be useful .    4.487336497062598
there has been no uniform finding of a relationship between cd44 variant expression and tumor progression .    3.0882561428667303
method : we assessed the expression pattern and prognostic impact of cd44 standard and cd44 UNK v4 , UNK , v6 , UNK and v10 in 40 ductal pancreatic carcinomas by UNK on paraffin - embedded tumor material in patients after tumor resection .    3.454958843700862
at the time of the investigation neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known .    2.9556379706064404
results : there was no correlation between the histomorphological parameter and the expression of cd44 splice variants .    2.9941639259058634
cd44 splice variants v4 - v10 were almost only expressed in tumor tissue .    3.0738718680255324
in ductal pancreatic carcinoma , patients with an UNK of cd44 splice variants had a worse prognosis .    3.7796476503819774
however , because of the small number of cases this was statistically not significant .    3.308460880508749
conclusion : cd44 splice variants may have an influence on prognosis in ductal pancreatic carcinoma .    3.003962628050209
however , further investigation on a larger number of patients is necessary to confirm these results .    4.041940221707633
signs and symptoms are extremely variable , depending on whether the compression of the plexus , of the artery or of the vein is predominant .    4.137365405436101
in the clinical examination the UNK test is of utmost importance .    3.4026209245375485
the visualization of the subclavian artery and vein by das in different positions is mandatory .    3.0468905325483666
less than 5 % of the patients show a subclavian artery aneurysm , but 76 % have obstructions of digital arteries .    3.6228570591882656
every patient , must undergo a neurological examination including the measuring of the proximal ulnar and median nerve conduction times .    3.3034328935685235
anatomical lesions of the subclavian artery , reduction of the proximal nerve conduction times and high - degree venous compression as well as disabling pain during the night with abuse of analgesics are absolute indications for the decompression of the neurovascular bundle .    4.230835903302488
this is achieved by the transaxillary UNK of the first rib together with a cervical rib and fibromuscular bands if present .    3.7541941732115847
the results of the primary operation are favourable : completely painfree 85 % , markedly improved 12 % , unchanged or worse 3 % .    3.0747599615297196
the results of operations for persisting and recurrent tos are disappointing : completely painfree 48 % , markedly improved 31 % , but 21 % unchanged or worse .    2.847820910601247
regional perfusion of the lung is not distributed UNK within the organ .    3.8289770801415504
based on the isolated UNK lung .    3.2269510104696257
the concept stresses the importance of different UNK forces along the vertical axis of the lung resulting in three zones in which no pulmonary perfusion ( zone 1 ) , UNK - like perfusion ( zone 2 ) , and continuous blood flow ( zone 3 ) prevail .    4.342056295873171
in this article , we review recent publications in which observations have been made which cannot be explained by the west model .    2.939298767930535
a new concept of distribution of regional pulmonary perfusion is presented which centers on vascular factors which are better suited to account for observed blood flow UNK .    2.9840322617862287
the pulmonary vasculature is composed of UNK of one structural unit : the vessel bifurcation .    3.2228572661264625
apart from its size , each single bifurcation is similar to all others .    3.0618888378705673
the pulmonary vessel tree can , therefore , be considered to be self - similar .    3.5550402847704263
self - similarity has been identified as a design principle of living nature .    3.1889088862885058
for measurement of the structure of such objects and their function , i . e . , in this case the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion , fractal geometry is best suited .    3.579361063091001
distribution of blood flow within the lung can be described by means of fractal analysis , and all phenomena of perfusion distribution can easily be explained when applying this concept .    3.790221969021723
furthermore , since the basis of fractal analysis is pulmonary vascular anatomy , it lends itself for the study of blood flow distribution .    3.8213802398450394
a major advantage is the independence of fractal parameters from resolution of perfusion measurements .    2.969930801739724
thus , fractal analysis can be used to compare results that have been obtained using different resolutions and different species .    3.4173238080600865
fractal methods have previously been used in medicine for other purposes .    3.744586475656532
nonlinear analyses of heart beat variability can predict the onset of malign cardiac UNK hours before actual appearance in the ecg .    3.2535643883805707
very similar methods applied to electrical brain activity have been shown to allow prediction of UNK seizures approximately 15 min prior to appearance of clinical symptoms .    3.2220973704936995
in part i of the paper the biomechanical and technical background of the eptt using the mpt fixator and the indications for this procedure have been described .    3.403286431334364
in part ii we report about the clinical application of the eptt in 67 patients with a wide spectrum of repairs and reconstructions of the extensor mechanism .    4.079725255671422
48 patients had fresh injuries , 18 of them with severe concomitant knee lesions and 19 patients had neglected UNK .    3.3900624676547952
there were 4 deep infections , two of them related to the mpt fixator .    3.624135085755464
in the patients with uneventful healing the fixator remained in place for 7 . 3 weeks in average .    3.5295794324111096
the clinical , isokinetic and radiological results were reviewed in 17 patients with an average follow - up time of 37 . 3 months .    3.4501081612621207
there were 5 patients with partial UNK and tendon reattachment because of lower patella pole comminution and 12 patients with tendon reattachment ruptured at the inferior patella pole or suture repair in UNK rupture .    3.1897710366673815
the clinical results according to the ikdc score were rated in 3 patients as normal , in 10 patients as nearly normal and in 4 patients as abnormal .    3.4381676127696332
this rating was highly dependend on the subjective judgement by the patients who considered their operated knees not as normal as the contralateral knees .    3.4910464049817596
from our clinical experiences and results we can derive that the eptt enables the surgical management of extensor mechanism UNK with a minimum of internal fixation material and provides a safe protection of the repairs and reconstructions during the healing period .    3.336780175885098
the eptt allows immediate unrestricted functional rehabilitation and early walking without crutches .    2.9897455066036707
thus the eptt represents an effective alternative to the UNK - tibial cerclage with a wire or synthetic ligaments .    3.612626260301797
ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting ( ponv ) , but it has not been proved to be superior to established UNK for prophylaxis or therapy .    3.648250398615869
we compared ondansetron vs droperidol for the treatment of ponv .    3.6563872829589754
our prospective , randomized double - blind study was performed between 15 october 1992 and july 1993 ; it included 271 gynaecological asa i - iii inpatients who had been operated on under general anaesthesia with intubation .    3.201728604175814
patients were excluded if : there was no informed consent ; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation ; the patient was pregnant or breast feeding ; allergies were being treated with antihistamines ; drug addiction was present or convulsions or parkinson ' s disease ; any pre - or intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered .    3.2059610566303665
all patients UNK an antiemetic and / or suffering from at least one emetic episode during the first 24 h postoperatively received either 8 mg ondansetron or 1 . 25 mg droperidol from identical 4 ml ampoules intravenously .    3.0909858026798736
all emetic episodes and the interval between administration and effect were also noted .    3.336813314222429
patients were interviewed 36 - 48 h postoperatively on subjective effects , side - effects and individual acceptance .    3.365190258716811
after oral premedication with diazepam , anaesthesia was induced with thiopental , in a few cases with etomidate or propofol .    2.744127375621825
relaxation was achieved with pancuronium or atracurium and , when indicated , with succinylcholine .    3.3119527634120747
muscular relaxation was antagonized with UNK and UNK .    3.2728734408071594
gastric content was aspirated once after intubation .    3.180515381277937
anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide / oxygen , enflurane , halothane or isoflurane and fentanyl up to 0 . 3 mg . statistical evaluation was performed by the unpaired student ' s t - test and the mann - whitney u test .    2.875711463302319
categoric variables were examined by the 2 test .    3.968145511881507
significance was defined as p < 0 . 05 .    4.168737660682929
of 271 patients , 100 ( 37 % ) experienced ponv .    3.321572387209279
the groups were statistically comparable with respect to demographic data , type and duration of operation , emesis record , perioperative UNK medication .    3.677881274464054
twenty patients in the ondansetron group and 27 in the droperidol group received the first antiemetic within 2 h , the other patients up to 17 h after extubation .    3.3700122814466296
nausea scores and emetic episodes were identical before antiemetic medication .    3.2228088100416414
the reduction of these parameters after medication was similar .    3.173218973416535
complete response over 6 h was 60 % in the ondansetron and 68 % in the droperidol group .    4.390196611529108
in both groups the first medication failed in 4 cases during the initial 2 h . twenty of the ondansetron and 16 of the droperidol patients needed a second dose ; among these 2 and 4 , respectively , a third UNK .    3.395091253342949
no rescue medication was necessary over 24 h and a mean of 1 . 4 ampoules was administered in both groups .    3.3285505073664727
onset and quality of emetic action were identical in both groups .    2.9826691954254234
it was not possible to evaluate 25 interviews due to UNK or UNK problems .    3.5078430629360993
multiple side - effects were noted frequently .    3.8591091233449943
injection pain was reported significantly more often in the droperidol , pruritus in the ondansetron group .    3.5646352854427565
ninety - three percent of the ondansetron and 85 % of the droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future ponv treatment .    3.483051979021698
ondansetron ( 8 mg ) and droperidol ( 1 . 25 mg ) proved to be equally effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic .    3.9391125575567614
both drugs showed similar side - effects .    3.030950373592362
due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our results to those obtained in other studies .    3.2742183316012814
paradoxical embolism is well - known in theory but rarely encountered in clinical practice .    3.4574264757614577
the typical pathophysiological background is the coincidence of venous thrombosis , elevated right atrial pressure , and a consecutive right - to - left shunting via a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect .    3.311146743016344
this review summarizes the results of internal cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in comparison to external cardioversion .    3.6969350262468184
internal cardioversion was achieved by positioning defibrillation electrodes in the right atrium and coronary sinus ( alternatively in the left pulmonary artery ) .    3.6392619747989503
in previous studies also a combined internal / external cardioversion was used by UNK a defibrillation electrode in the right atrium together with a cutaneous patch electrode .    3.3207948394944533
although in comparative studies the success rate of 91 - 93 % with internal cardioversion is higher compared to success rates of 67 - 79 % with external cardioversion , the conventional method of external cardioversion remains the method of first choice .    3.2861472402230976
the success rate of internal cardioversion after failed external cardioversion ranges from 73 to over 90 % .    2.813468611434882
possible indications for primary internal cardioversion are : induced atrial fibrillation during electrophysiological studies , atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in patients with permanent pacemaker implants .    3.342558868030826
objective : the objective of the study is to evaluate the importance of home care for patients with advanced tumor diseases and for their families .    4.052482854303227
vdd single - lead systems use floating ring electrodes for atrial sensing .    2.7853793104388225
to ensure an optimal atrial sensing function , knowledge of the interactions between electrode design , pacemaker , amplifier and implantation technique is required .    3.1304493702833565
in this overview , technical determinants of atrial sensing concerning atrial ring configuration ( surface area , ring spacing , full / half ring ) , design of the lead ( insulation material , conductor coil configuration ) , and amplifier design ( differential amplifier , sensing impedance , bandpass filter ) shall be explained and related to determinants at implant ( av distance , site of implantation , atrial position , intraoperative measurement technique ) .    2.8083839506264243
especially in a position close to the atrial wall , a wide ring spacing detects a less clear - cut signal than a short ring spacing ; on the other hand , with a wide ring spacing , sensing is less compromised if the rings move to a worse position further away from the wall .    2.862737279615874
a narrow ring spacing detects a UNK signal if positioned close to the atrial wall , but a considerable reduction of sensed p wave amplitude may result if it UNK away from the wall or to an oblique angle relative to the atrial depolarization front .    2.9079921917565397
( 2 ) design of the lead : polyurethane as insulation material provides a higher stiffness than silicone insulation .    2.9205177991263653
a coaxial conductor configuration increases stiffness and consequently the possibility to UNK the atrial part of the lead .    4.027329561321969
thus , if a position close to the atrial wall is desired , the combination of a coaxial conductor coil , polyurethane insulation , and a narrow ring spacing seems most promising .    3.1254694587023053
( 3 ) amplifier design : for atrial sensing in vdd systems , bipolar sensing , differential amplifier , high sensing impedance ( > = UNK ) , and a wide bandpass filter ( e . g . , 10 - UNK ) should be realized .    3.5025810128760244
especially the inclusion of a relatively low frequency range ( 10 - UNK ) is important , because compared to a fixed atrial electrode , a higher quantity of the atrial signal sensed by a floating electrode is in the low - frequency range .    3.8196822878471868
( 4 ) implantation : to choose the best fitting electrode , a preoperative assessment of the size of the right cardiac cavities should be performed .    3.6914776114896455
a position of the ring electrodes in the mid - to - high right atrium parallel to the lateral wall should be the goal .    3.887185157671478
correct interpretation of the sensed p wave amplitude and prediction of sufficient sensing after connection with the pacemaker is only possible with exact knowledge of the measurement technique of the intraoperative pacing system analyzer and the connected permanent pacemaker device ( bandpass filter , signal peak - to baseline or peak - to - peak ) .    3.165151818456191
attention should be paid to the fixation of the electrode at the site of insertion to avoid postoperative dislocation of the ring electrodes .    3.466430398450071
knowledge of different electrode / pacemaker specific parameters and special aspects at implantation is a prerequisite for optimal function of vdd single - lead systems .    2.8382283449525074
preoperatively , considerations should concern the choice of the electrode ( av distance , ring spacing ) and implantation strategy ( position close to or rather apart from the atrial wall ) .    3.1318122441302525
an atrial position may only be accepted if sufficient sensing can be documented with a measuring method similar to that of the implanted pacemaker .    3.2527354846948007
objectives : to investigate the agreement ( and its potential dependency on extravascular lung water ) between transpulmonary ( UNK ) and standard pulmonary artery ( paid ) thermodilution cardiac output measurements .    3.2185032695783278
in the industrial western world , 8 % of the population suffer from urogenital discomfort .    3.549146899829778
epidemiologic studies show that the incidence rises with age .    3.822024016459487
in light of the steadily increasing longevity in the female population , clinically manifested irregularities such as urogenital atrophy , recurrent urinary tract infections , UNK bladder , and incontinence pose a challenge to the attending physician .    2.6971713744584607
to this day , urinary incontinence in later life is considered " normal " and " caused by old age . "    3.7451419266959514
however , among other age - related reasons , the main cause of this disorder is postmenopausal hormone deficiency .    3.743099368959883
thus , following thorough diagnostics , pathological changes in the urogenital tract can often be reduced or altogether eliminated by simple conservative measures such as topical hormone administration , which rapidly enhance patients ' quality of life .    2.884755055447501
the present study gives an overview of the physiology of urogenital aging and the diagnostic and therapeutic means available to physicians to alleviate patients ' discomfort .    2.914638852062747
recurrent abdominal pain ( rap ) is one of the most common pain syndromes in childhood , with prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 20 % in all school - age children .    2.865135849194864
in nearly 50 % the complaints persist over many years of their life - span to adolescence or adulthood .    2.289439070008695
although the empirical findings have increased in the last decade , our knowledge about the etiology , pathogenesis , and pathophysiology is still very limited .    2.897429148164407
current approaches suggest that we understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance ( UNK paradigm ) .    2.4851668644800755
in this respect there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial causes ( daily UNK , specific life events ) , psychopathological factors ( anxiety , depression , somatization disorder ) , and social environmental influences ( mother ' s psychopathology , social modelling , reinforcement ) in the pathogenesis of functional abdominal pain .    3.15547162016507
the noticeable correlation with other pain syndromes and functional disturbances indicates that recurrent pain may possibly be a manifestation of a basic somatization disorder .    3.3203318869016942
the unfavourable long - term prognosis supports the need for early and specific interventions .    3.1880782502036706
psychological treatment requires a medical examination to exclude organic origins .    3.3281872199359213
some of these invasive diagnostic procedures can be very difficult , expensive and distressing for the child .    3.060017524911759
behavioural medicine is based upon having an extensive family history and symptom analysis .    3.263049604239839
the psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis , reduction of pain symptoms and environmental modification .    2.6237283484729583
in recent years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioural treatment programs for children .    2.113283278491706
although preliminary data on the use of these behavioural medicine programs have shown some promise , further investigations are needed to examine the applicability and effectiveness of specific interventions in the treatment of abdominal pain symptoms .    3.8488018106102917
dermatologic disorders of the stump in patients with a leg amputation may have characteristic pathophysiologic and clinical features .    4.348928894103136
a knowledge of these factors may lead to earlier diagnosis and avoid immobilization .    3.602681943421676
there ist no german language review of this aspect of dermatology .    3.187238858326715
after providing an overview of the problem , including a discussion of prostheses , we review the following problems : mechanically induced blisters , follicular keratoses , epidermoid cysts , stump edema syndrome , UNK ( pseudo - kaposi sarcoma ) and verrucous hyperplasia .    3.3279492617419733
secondary aortoenteric fistulas are a well - known complication after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm .    3.086547199068186
this is the first case description of an aortoenteric fistula after endoluminal treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm .    2.816848776184506
preoperative diagnosis by UNK UNK established infection of the protheses .    3.8160872192012953
the problem was solved by closing the defect of duodenum , removing the UNK and in situ reconstruction with UNK .    3.515233887167968
the reasons and consequences are discussed .    2.9914053468234867
concepts in the treatment of craniomaxillofacial fractures have changed over the last 15 years .    3.9290820795490458
modern imaging techniques have become a central part in establishing a proper diagnosis .    3.1554401004815964
advanced life support and intensive care medicine allow for early primary fracture treatment .    3.475999595796123
the former principles of minimal exposure of bone fragments using small incisions have been replaced by principles from reconstructive craniofacial surgery comprising extensive subperiosteal dissection , exposure of all fracture lines , open reduction and rigid internal fixation .    2.805701228634955
missing bony structures are replaced primarily by autogenous bone grafts .    3.23185611394334
using these concepts , most late esthetic and functional sequelae of facial fractures can be diminished remarkably .    3.0913547367995275
in a 20 - year period ( 1974 - 1993 ) , UNK patients underwent surgery of the gallbladder .    4.4129280252821745
acute cholecystitis was the indication for emergency laparotomy in UNK patients ( 20 , 5 % ) .    4.028942843354981
cases of acute cholecystitis complicated by perforation , peritonitis , and / or the presence of concrements in the biliary duct are associated with an increased mortality , however .    3.70312117814996
we were able to demonstrate that advanced age is a risk factor in complicated cases and contributes to increased post - surgical mortality .    2.9280214526723
the clinical effect of UNK radiation on ocular UNK is controversial not only because of the variety of treatment modalities .    3.5852012342461803
the aim of our study was to investigate an experimental model which allows to evaluate radiation parameters and to study the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on neoangiogenesis .    2.9200068329473976
we report on a 59 - year - old woman patient with selective iga deficiency and familial hypercholesterinaemia .    2.684954737550651
to lower elevated ldl levels in the patient ' s blood , immunoadsorption therapy with sheep - anti - human polyclonal antibodies coupled to sepharose columns was administered .    2.972470941531559
the patient ' s history revealed a fresh cell therapy with fetal sheep cells 10 years previously .    2.7729472129432597
a nationwide survey was performed to evaluate the significance of knee replacement ( endoprosthesis ) in germany .    3.565264943278864
all orthopaedic , traumatologic and general surgeons were asked about their preferred surgical techniques , favourite types of prosthesis and related issues .    2.8908676279727223
UNK prostheses have been increasingly preferred to constrained prostheses in the last few years .    2.923645677434772
unicompartmental prostheses as well as constrained prostheses and high tibial osteotomies are still chosen for special cases .    3.790348956627779
revisions were most commonly due to patella problems .    3.420516493654967
patella replacement is popular to prevent this problem .    3.5209577312488585
endoprosthetic knee surgery receives as much UNK among german surgeons as endoprosthetic hip surgery .    2.9874804634530046
an important problem is the increasing costs of the method .    3.37397014623707
chronic pulmonary hypertension and septic lung failure display different clinical features resulting in severe disturbances in the pulmonary circulation .    3.2494486116793873
in these diseases , the pulmonary UNK is impaired by a pathologic constriction of blood vessels that may lead to right ventricular UNK as well as serious worsening of gas exchange mainly caused by ventilation / perfusion mismatch .    3.713676075623983
various mechanisms deteriorating the vascular function may induce both an irreversible and a reversible contraction of pulmonary vessels , respectively .    2.881333721813134
two pharmacological approaches exist to reduce the vascular resistance : .    3.6831414530609727
objective : to examine mortality , mobility , pain , UNK rates six month after hip fractures .    2.9983641870089905
lateral acetabular osteotomy in comparison to three - dimensional osteotomies of the pelvis in hip dysplasia is a simple technical procedure .    4.124835982937833
contraindications are an age over 8 years and an irreducible femoral head .    3.198477494842249
for a long time we have used UNK UNK bone wedges from animals .    3.081067876160913
we now use autoclaved and deep - frozen wedges from allogenic femoral heads .    2.8697817706562474
our results in 109 patients show that this method is very successful ; even extreme angles of acetabular index correction are possible with this technique .    3.0779641395793482
it is UNK that the lateral UNK with autoclaved allogenic bone graft is not used frequently and we recommend that this method be installed at all paediatric orthopaedic hospitals .    2.8769913682805885
there are only few publications about the effect of music therapy on pain relief .    3.1519898084114306
the intention of this prospective study is to demonstrate the influence of the UNK / UNK method of active music therapy in a group of 12 patients with fibromyalgia , UNK pain syndromes and UNK on pain reduction , life quality and coping .    4.8823145409493085
the clinical parameters of each patient were related to the observations in the audio - and video - documented music therapy settings and to the self - reported changes in pain intensity and pain behaviour .    3.4080990653927072
there was a significant reduction of pain intensity and pain - related disability in the music group compared to a control group , but no change in the depression and anxiety score .    3.4856980659322687
the influence of music therapy could be even better demonstrated in the systematic analysis of the single cases by individual profiles .    3.474740324601409
active music therapy affects especially the communicative and emotional dimension of chronic pain .    3.0474028133676754
psychophysiological and psychodynamic models are presented to explain the effectiveness of music therapy on pain reduction .    3.773416709376011
clinical studies on music therapy as well as on other " art therapies " should relate the analysis of clinical parameters to the descriptive - UNK documentation of the therapeutic process to demonstrate systematically the influence of music and art in the individual case .    3.4318253335298974
background : retrospective analysis to assess the value of the sequential arginine - insulin - test ( UNK ) in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency ( UNK ) .    3.755126069241231
case report : the case of a 57 - year - old woman is reported who was admitted for peripheral UNK .    2.991853402621883
auditory similarities in voices of monozygotic twins have already been described in the literature .    2.9470574164693595
however , is there a clinical relevance ?    3.4208441936347955
thus , the present study was designed to identify parameters of vocal performance and acoustic features which are significantly more similar in monozygotic twins than in non - related persons .    2.9057097795976947
in our hypothesis , comparable prerequisites for an increased vocal load in a profession or in an UNK education of the voice could be due to these similarities .    3.3283094420596684
we compared intra - pair differences with data from a control group .    2.8731595932775376
moreover , we examined the correlation of intra - pair differences with the age of the monozygotic twins .    3.2629204962873937
a greater difference in older twin pairs than in younger pairs could show the effect of an UNK influence .    3.4259394375262424
in addition to the few UNK studies in twins in the literature , we used current methods for acoustic analysis .    3.4534766005091417
we examined seven parameters of vocal performance and three acoustic features in 31 monozygotic twin pairs ( median age 36 years , range 18 - 75 years ) and compared them with 30 control group pairs , which consisted of non - related persons of the same age and sex , newly combined from the group of monozygotic twins ( " statistical twins " ) .    3.174733028257841
we found significant differences in seven of ten parameters ( vocal range , highest and lowest vocal fundamental frequency , fundamental speaking frequency , maximum voice intensity , number of UNK , UNK of intensity ; u - test by mann - whitney ) .    3.363761170075489
no correlation of the differences of the identical twins with age was found in the examined parameters .    3.8779616645549346
the voices of identical twins are significantly more similar than those of non - related persons regarding the above mentioned features .    3.2364562355235797
thus , the suitability of the voices of monozygotic twins for professions with a high demand on voice is comparable .    2.885879623980212
the missing correlation with age could be due to the fact that the environmental effects were not measurable , and / or the development of the voice is more influenced by genetic effects .    3.582192993040427
after > 10 000 treatments - our hm3 / 4 and UNK UNK have been replaced by the siemens lithostar multiline .    3.3143262073017543
as a eswl center with eswl as the primary treatment indication for all types of stones in kidney and ureter we report our initial experience with this new UNK UNK .    3.1617893361630216
the system consists of an electromagnetic shock - wave UNK ( focus 80 x 5 mm ) and a digital fluoroscopy unit .    3.3796539755571824
stone localization is achieved in a - 10 ° and + 30 ° position without movement of the patient .    3.236711390721553
the treatment table itself allows most UNK and percutaneous auxiliary procedures .    2.9202979999513565
additionally , an UNK UNK ultrasound is available .    3.7474912601570303
from 10 / 94 to 08 / 95 , 204 male and 96 female patients with a mean age of 50 . 7 ( 4 - 92 ) years underwent eswl with the lithostar multiline .    3.5320775550333225
the mean stone diameter was 10 . 3 ( 2 - 20 ) mm with 53 % ureteral and 47 % renal stones .    3.182394373285492
300 patients underwent UNK treatments ( average shocks UNK , range UNK - 8000 ; mean energy level 5 . 5 , range 1 - 9 ) .    3.6038776699456827
stone localization was achieved after 5 ( 1 - 39 ) min ( mean fluoroscopy time 3 . 1 ( 0 . 5 - 16 . 2 ) min ) .    4.000803377530744
in 92 . 7 % no analgesic premedication was done .    3.657002599422716
56 % of the patients needed no analgesics at all during eswl .    4.090505253538174
44 % received 8 . 1 ( 2 - 15 ) mg piritramid intravenously .    4.064840928987285
epidural anesthesia was performed in only 2 . 3 % for a second treatment .    4.512892896804471
95 % of the patients had complete stone disintegration .    3.8100081541935724
in 68 % disintegration was achieved in one session .    3.8390385920921113
eswl was repeated for further disintegration in 18 . 5 % , because of an unsuccessful treatment in 11 . 5 % and because of technical interruption of the previous session in 2 . 5 % .    4.281392088600765
we saw UNK haematomas in 2 % .    3.0826068967520777
auxiliary procedures following eswl were necessary in only 9 . 2 % of the patients .    3.2843603348153723
in situ eswl with the new lithostar multiline seems to be as effective as the UNK hm3 / 4 .    3.6652326249702463
analgesia - free treatment was performed in more than 50 % of the patients .    3.0515148821922473
auxiliary procedures were less frequently necessary as compared to our previous experience with in situ eswl .    3.756475757860005
we report on a UNK frequent referral of former preterm babies with respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) infection and subsequent ards in our hospital during the UNK 1994 / 95 with regard to the clinical course under application of alternative treatment modalities .    2.8438808414965804
treatment modalities like inhalational UNK , use of UNK and instillation of surfactant had been tried without success .    3.5208645680610506
all children ( age : 1 - 43 months ) were ventilated for 6 . 6 ( 1 - 17 ) days with fio2 = 1 . 0 and a mean airway pressure of 16 . 4 ( 10 - 24 ) cm h2o .    4.167119831458676
mean arterial blood gases were 49 ( pao2 ) and 41 ( pco2 ) mm hg , the UNK was 33 . 4 .    3.652052184166634
by inhalational no in combination with UNK or hfov 4 patients could be stabilized , in the other 6 ecmo became necessary .    4.315432937899792
two of them died in spite of several weeks on ecmo ; 8 children survived and could be discharged home after a mean hospital stay of 3 months .    3.3684675695732786
even in very severe cases of rsv infection treatment modalities like no , hfov and ecmo can be used successfully .    3.246741077462355
the use of these treatment modalities must be considered before the lung damage is irreversible ; in those cases a pre - existing bpd is no contraindication even for extracorporeal lung support .    3.2900935670625584
the vascular organization of human spermatic cord was analyzed by means of injection and by casting preparation of the testicular artery and veins of the UNK plexus after UNK .    3.833924790808736
after leaving the human testis , the testicular veins are organized in two main groups and form two vein plexus .    2.972997818231308
one of these vein groups forms a tight plexus around the testicular artery .    2.473367195574249
computer - aided 3 - d reconstructions based on the paraffin serial sections of the human spermatic cord allowed us to demonstrate the relation between the blood vessels and the other tissue structures of the spermatic cord .    3.725775964832432
the results obtained allowed us to UNK the human spermatic cord into three compartments .    3.3765392994947487
the UNK compartment contains the vas UNK and its blood vessels .    2.9057426025296285
the middle compartment contains the testicular artery and the vein group which forms a tight plexus around this artery .    2.9473930313000865
the UNK compartment contains a vein group which shows no topographic relation to the testicular artery .    2.863507940500297
this vein group is embedded in a large , macroscopically visible volume of fatty tissue .    3.0606971078384393
to be sure of sparing the testicular artery during antegrade sclerotherapy this vein group should be prepared .    2.868264635910155
it has known for a long time that sydenham ' s chorea and tics , as seen in UNK de la UNK ' s syndrome ( gts ) , are UNK very similar .    3.1980515761878046
tics may occur as symptoms of acute sydenham ' s chorea or persist over years as residual symptoms .    3.008913053667831
investigations of children suffering from gts , including obsessive - UNK symptoms , have provided signs of a UNK autoimmune process but also shown that treatment based on immunological interventions has been effective .    3.3183325482186863
we treated a 14 - year - old boy showing all diagnostic criteria of gts , familial susceptibility , and an increase in the antibody titer of streptococcal antigens with UNK immunoglobulins i . v .    3.1062112585698016
response to this therapy was good regarding motor tics , vocal tics , and behavioral symptoms such as disturbed impulse control which still persisted after 9 months .    2.991635525997531
these findings and the successful therapy underline reports of the literature and point to a pathogenetic mechanism of an immunologically triggered disturbance of the striatal dopaminergic system , at least in a subgroup of gts .    3.331497879252783
we report on three cases with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ) and insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( iddm ) or UNK .    2.482121367879534
all three patients suffered from autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type ii .    2.645316502683293
among our patients with isolated iddm ( about 250 patients ) no case of itp was seen .    3.297080065187306
therefore we recommend that all patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored for other diseases associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type ii .    2.936463942898641
several studies have documented the effectiveness of ldl - cholesterol lowering in cad primary prevention .    3.119183286813354
the west of scotland prevention study resulted in risk reduction by about one third through ldl - cholesterol lowering .    2.9051206828041947
therapy primarily aims at life style changes , UNK of smoking and weight reduction as well as dietary changes to achieve ldl - cholesterol levels of 115 - 175 mg / dl ( 3 - 4 . 5 mmol / l ) , depending on the individual risk constellation .    3.659600479655941
this strategy allows to reduce the number of patients needed to treat in order to prevent one cad event ( 56 in isolated hypercholesterolemia ) to 14 - 24 in high risk persons , approaching the number ( n = 13 ) known for effective lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease .    3.209624534324522
one hundred and three cases of spitz nevi were reviewed .    3.129011305796526
36 % of these patients were adults .    4.46408724293536
the lesions in children occurred primarily on the face and secondarily on the trunk followed by the extremities .    3.608098665450767
in adults , they affect the legs in women , and the trunk in men as does malignant melanoma .    3.616856076370264
clinically they were diagnosed more frequently as spitz nevi in children and adolescents than in adults .    3.161808813744833
spitz nevi were most commonly mistaken clinically for " common " melanocytic nevus , hemangioma , verruca , fibrous histiocytoma , molluscum contagiosum , granuloma pyogenicum , UNK , and melanoma .    3.1060503282464293
histologically , there are various expressions of spitz nevi , but they are usually compound melanocytic nevi with little pigmentation and typically large spindle - and / or epithelioid melanocytes .    3.3980768823079863
there are only small histopathological differences between spitz nevi in childhood and adulthood : one important feature rarely seen in spitz nevi of adults is multiple mitotic figures at the UNK - epidermal junction but rarely at the base of the melanocytic nevus .    3.0063434828820683
since may 1998 we have treated 15 patients with extensive vascular occlusion at the femoropopliteal level .    3.466097044353429
the implantation is carried out via a single inguinal approach in combination with conventional vascular surgical techniques like UNK UNK of the superficial femoral artery , local tea and patch - grafting of the femoral bifurcation , angioplasty , local lysis , etc .    3.6423207521703187
the self - expanding thin - walled ptfe stent prothesis appears to be a viable alternative to the femoropopliteal p1 bypass and can be performed under local anesthesia , percutaneously or through a small inguinal incision .    3.248436484432035
the implantation can be carried out with minimal tissue trauma .    3.4825070988534628
radiological and orthopaedic outcome in severe and moderate haemophilia a and b patients undergoing long - term prophylactic treatment were prospectively investigated focusing on the age of onset of prophylaxis and the number of joint bleedings prior to treatment .    3.523611382885617
we report on 21 patients with severe and moderate haemophilia a and b receiving prophylactic treatment of between 3 . 1 and 16 . 1 years duration .    3.4435977982034784
three patient groups were evaluated according to the age at onset of prophylaxis .    4.010511786484562
in group i ( n = 8 ) prophylactic treatment was initiated in the first 2 years of life .    3.311938314290819
patients of group ii ( n = 6 ) received prophylaxis at the age of 3 - 6 years .    3.2403227979157303
late - onset or secondary prophylactic treatment was started at the age of 6 years and above in 7 patients ( group iii ) .    3.795029569051062
all patients received virus - UNK f viii or f ix concentrates at dosages of 30 - 40 iu , in some cases up to 50 iu / kg body weight i . v . three times per week for those with haemophilia a and twice per week for those with haemophilia b . elbow , knee and ankle joints were investigated at 3 - 4 yearly intervals according to the radiological and orthopaedic scores recommended by the world federation of haemophilia ( UNK ) .    3.0052788779361777
the total number of joint bleedings before and after start of prophylaxis were recorded in all patients .    3.2592125421265505
in group i 7 out of 8 patients had unaffected joints with constant radiological and orthopaedic scores of zero or 1 , after a median of 11 . 25 years of prophylactic treatment .    3.1786630316867486
one patient in this group demonstrated mild radiological alterations ( score 4 ) .    3.2665602340925046
patients of group ii showed neither radiological nor orthopaedic alterations at study entry .    2.5913025076365868
treatment group iii already showed considerable joint damage at study entry with a median radiological score of 11 ( 0 - 33 ) and a median orthopaedic score of 4 ( 0 - 11 ) .    3.728316335870531
despite prophylactic treatment both , orthopaedic ( median 8 , range 2 - 12 ) and radiological scores ( median 19 . 5 , range 2 - 47 ) deteriorated after 3 years .    3.3101993164291525
prior to onset of prophylaxis no or only one joint bleeding occurred in treatment group i .    3.1416862707912285
in group ii , a median of 6 joint bleeds ( range 1 - 8 ) were reported before prophylaxis was started .    3.5561709866498457
patients of group iii usually experienced a median of more than 10 joint haemorrhages ( range 6 - 10 or more ) .    3.3638406039397113
under prophylactic treatment the number of joint bleedings decreased significantly in groups ii and iii .    3.6748224775427865
however , radiological and orthopaedic scores increased as a sign of progressing osteoarthropathic alterations in patients reporting more than 6 joint haemorrhages before onset of prophylaxis whereas no joint alterations could be assessed in patients with no or only one joint bleeding episode prior to prophylaxis .    3.135619484435928
even a small number of joint bleedings seems to cause irreversible osteoarthropathic alterations leading to haemophilic arthropathy .    3.001974150469765
once apparent , further progression of joint damage could not be arrested despite of prophylactic treatment ( group ii and iii ) .    3.4532081824587273
in order to prevent haemophilic arthropathy , effective prophylaxis should be started before or at least after the first joint bleeding in severe haemophilia a and b .    3.05871790210176
the hemodynamic treatment of septic shock consists of fluid repletion , maintenance of an adequate cardiac output , and restoration of mean arterial pressure .    3.0185343660444937
norepinephrine is a potent UNK that can be considered when the patient is adequately fluid resuscitated , when cardiac output is greater than 3 . 5 l / min / m2 ( or sv o2 > = 65 % ) and when blood pressure remains low .    3.9912894952554123
renal effects of norepinephrine were evaluated in several studies ; urine output , creatinine clearance , and osmolar clearance are significantly increased .    3.276882988819146
norepinephrine is perfectly suited in situations of high renal output and low renal resistance , as is the case in septic shock patients .    3.0907806684545074
the effect on oxygen transport is unpredictable .    2.815418626710367
the effects on lactate concentrations were poorly evaluated , but several studies suggest that the drug does not worsen and can even improve tissue oxygenation of septic shock patients .    3.0278322067719
in conclusion , the clinical experience with norepinephrine strongly suggests that this drug can successfully increase blood pressure without deteriorating cardiac output and organ function .    2.9020723302907685
whether using norepinephrine in septic shock patients effects mortality as compared to dopamine or epinephrine still requires a prospective study .    3.23681410333212
ischemia was recognized not as capillary non - perfusion but as impaired retinal perfusion .    3.1880961307847104
elderly patients with known episodes of atrial arrhythmia and indication to pacemaker therapy are borderline cases relative to selection of ventricular single - chamber or dual - chamber pacemaker .    3.1887936350368347
the frequency of recurrence of arrhythmic episodes under dual - chamber pacemaker therapy is there the most important criterion .    3.119794425586871
the differences between patients prone to paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter ) and patients without atrial tachyarrhythmia in their medical history were investigated .    3.0571441571975293
frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation / flutter and the rate of successful therapy after implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker were studied .    3.658771414611119
the long - term history of 39 patients with known intermittent or UNK successfully treated episodes of atrial fibrillation / flutter was compared with 24 patients with new atrial tachyarrhythmia after pacemaker implantation .    3.200490249227614
there was no significant difference in the frequency of recurrence and in therapy efficiency of atrial tachyarrhythmia between both groups .    2.9753070862473856
the results show the benefit of implanting a dual chamber pacemaker also for patients with a known history of atrial tachyarrhythmia .    3.2298854385405877
it therefore , should be postulated for therapy of those patients .    3.7448595341675652
although the risks and side effects of blood transfusions have been significantly reduced during the past years , the potential infectious and immunologic side effects still require a clear and restricted indication before each transfusion is performed .    3.4140937168483987
however , the transfusion errors before and during administration of blood components nowadays represent the highest risk in particular for critical care and high risk patients .    3.0655438083089352
this article focuses on the specific problems of handling , preparation , and practical performance of transfusions .    3.031187685706127
some practical aspects and problems of transfusions are examplary shown for intensive care and high risk patients , such as immunosuppressed , transplanted or UNK patients and critical care premature neonates .    3.4838649091269134
vincent ' s angina ( UNK - vincent ) is the most prominent disease caused by coinciding infections from UNK and UNK both belonging to obligate anaerobic bacterias .    4.118474856948367
a possible symbiotic infection of both UNK may become manifest on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the oropharynx beside the UNK .    2.848032289845412
we report the case of a 29 year old female patient with necrotizing UNK of the soft palate suspicious for stomatitis ulceromembranacea .    2.972352902349576
in case necrotizing inflammations of the oral cavity area were to be found infections due to anaerobic bacterias should be considered mostly occuring as mixed infections .    3.249749553599425
the correct identification by cultivation UNK out to be difficult in that it requires special conditions .    3.4396508178349516
furthermore , reliable detection of these bacterias necessitates careful collection and transport of patients specimens .    2.915589930011475
in case of UNK ( UNK ) a specimen should be prepared for microscopic examination beside setting up a special culture .    3.5700454995146425
this is because the staining is the most suitable procedure for UNK identification to support the clinical diagnosis of stomatitis ulceromembranacea .    3.4901701872606
quantitative tissue doppler echocardiography is a new diagnostic approach to left ventricular systolic performance .    3.987822815070168
the aim of the present study was to validate a recently developed method based on the computer software tdi - labor enabling a variable time and space related measurement of regional wall velocity from tissue doppler images .    2.70264523686982
the same images were employed for comparative measurement of the mean endocardial velocity using the conventional m - mode slope approach .    3.263127168966407
tissue doppler data of the subendocardial wall velocity were found to correspond closely to the mean endocardial wall velocity ( y = 0 . UNK + 0 . 17 ; r = 0 . 77 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    3.279280741210317
the average wall motion gradient of the population was 1 . 33 + / - 0 . 35 .    3.768702972877117
wall motion velocity and wall motion gradient were shown to be not age dependent .    3.2905912242217608
UNK , the profession of geriatric nurse has arisen from the care of the sick and has developed very differently from region to region .    2.8091489335632938
a question as to the status of development of the profession of geriatric nurse cannot be answered by reference to the current status of legislation on professional law matters .    3.471696167169006
if experts in that field focus too long on such matters , there is a danger that decisive developments in the profession of geriatric nurse take place outside their field of vision .    2.97449388673029
it is reported about the recent detection of not yet compensated victims of forced sterilisation during the third reich .    2.7755246113863543
the author describes the current state of compensation practice .    2.9421386753460057
from a global viewpoint , tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time .    3.0545196354325905
the situation in germany , as in most comparable industrialized nations , is stable .    3.2555260280242693
the UNK trend of previous years continued in 1997 , when 11 , 163 people developed active tuberculosis - an incidence of 13 . 6 / 100 , 000 .    3.2073710066023513
however , the tuberculosis problem cannot be restricted to one country , and germany is particularly affected by trends in eastern europe and in the former UNK countries .    3.214664103550023
these countries experienced a marked increase of tuberculosis cases and resistant strains during recent years , a tendency which can only be UNK by fast , well - aimed and efficient action in the affected areas .    3.4337877887339245
the industrialized nations in particular should consider financial and logistic contributions as their duty .    3.025347501227575
crucial for control of the tuberculosis situation within each country are registration and close observation of epidemiological trends , identification of high - risk groups , and continuation of established tuberculosis control measures .    3.015729341607948
we report about a 61 years old patient , who suffered a rare ulnar dislocation of the UNK after being arrested by the police .    3.9364234954003137
in a 19 - year - old patient who had undergone a pyeloplasty of the left renal pelvis 6 years before , a mature metastasis of an occult mature teratoma of the testis was found at the former operation site .    3.128456087967701
this case - in addition to those published previously - emphasizes the fact that a mature teratoma of the testis has to be regarded as a malignant tumor in adults .    3.544795722775497
it is supposed that the mature teratoma originates , as other testicular tumors , from carcinoma - in - situ - cells , which are responsible for metastasize and are not detected after lysis .    3.5467845563120375
angiofibromas are usually characterized by their UNK in adolescent males with a typical localization and involvement of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx .    3.6258315200321696
even the suspicion of an UNK angiofibroma or an angiofibroma in young children must be viewed in general with UNK , although reports of angiofibromas with atypical localizations and manifestations in young children have appeared in the literature .    3.2810135726633685
three cases of this fibro - vascular neoplasm with manifestations in the first decade of life and atypical localizations are presented : ( 1 ) an angiofibroma medial to the left lacrimal sac in a 15 - month old boy , ( 2 ) a right paranasal localization in a 9 - year - old boy and ( 3 ) an angiofibroma limited to the right UNK sinus in a 6 - year old boy .    3.8088069366049515
in all three cases the neoplasm was resected via an endonasal , micro - endoscopic approach that avoided an external incision .    2.820878967975459
according to the literature and based on our own experiences with typical histological findings in all three cases , the clinician has to be aware that the rare angiofibroma can occur in pre - adolescent children with atypical localizations .    3.6389557265598262
the endonasal surgical approach is without any doubt the least traumatic one and in selected cases allows resection of a circumscribed tumor considering functional and aesthetic aspects .    3.301563802297721
objective : chronic recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is frequently due to a helicobacter pylori - associated gastritis .    3.570305482715328
the diagnosis should be verified either by gastric biopsy culture or by histological investigations of the gastric mucosa in children .    3.145081800041631
the purpose of the present study was to UNK whether an elisa for helicobacter pylori has an adequate predictive reliability with regard to the putative gastric histology in order to possibly prevent unnecessary biopsies and associated UNK .    3.0746825231643844
in this case there is no injury to the spinal cord , because the " saving fracture " of the vertebral arc prevents it .    4.138026372031231
one case of a severe dislocated fracture at UNK - 12 is reported .    3.4093945392661538
in practice , a complete set of x - rays should be done after high - speed trauma , even if no neurological deficit is present .    3.621012734095467
the treatment is operative by open reduction and fusion from the ventral or dorsal column .    2.954356577313859
it has been used for almost 35 years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long - term sedation .    3.4047709934048984
its convincing pharmacological properties , without serious UNK effects on circulation or respiration , are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action .    3.0684316754583776
this is not a major problem with long - term sedation during icu treatment .    3.5128338735658313
ghb has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury , where it compares favourably with barbiturates .    3.703874274953068
however , in some experimental animals ghb has been shown to produce seizure - like activities , and the compound is being used to produce absence - like seizures .    3.5348946904285063
ghb has been used in our icu for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients UNK the respirator during spontaneous respiration .    3.222821384674789
no serious side effects were observed in these patients , while in some patients under haemodialysis UNK and metabolic alkalosis developed ; both were reversible after discontinuation of ghb and restriction of additional sodium input ( UNK , the commercially available ghb preparation in germany , contains 9 . 2 mmol sodium / g ; the daily dose averages 20 - 40 g ghb , i . e .    3.4409340874712617
in europe ultrasonography has displaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage ( UNK ) in the primary survey of polytraumatized patients with suspected abdominal trauma .    3.5895613223227167
hemodynamically unstable patients who are brought to the emergency room with blunt abdominal trauma will go directly to the operating room after a rapid ultrasonography examination with evidence of hemoperitoneum .    3.5249098340488
in hemodynamically stable patients , in addition to ultrasonography , computed tomography can be done .    3.7469072335443134
this is especially efficient if evaluation with sonography is not completely possible or shows little pathology ( e . g .    2.753435343908076
small amounts of hemoperitoneum ) .    3.187334630500217
we report on a posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk , something which is rather rare .    2.8504053823643347
the injury was caused by blunt chest trauma following a car accident .    3.0335938986009654
computed tomography could not find the brachiocephalic lesion .    3.10139460005955
in patients with fractures of the upper ribs after blunt chest trauma , angiography should be done to exclude severe injuries of the aorta and brachiocephalic vessels .    3.8448093390256703
even after the strengthening by the law of 1997 , the german criminal law regarding corruption is no obstacle for cooperation between medical research and industry .    3.3188525657235863
the injustice of corruption is an irregular exchange between performing one ' s duty and benefits .    3.1524547496791824
according to this , an enterprise may give funds to a scientist for research purposes if no counter performance exceeding the research is associated with this .    3.332423549548643
however , it makes a difference if the scientist has to show his appreciation by influencing economic decisions of the clinic in favor of the enterprise .    2.886015372739144
in case of such an injustice , it is , under the new law , no longer important if the benefit is destined for the scientist himself or for another person or organization .    3.343533003560563
thus , it is in the interest of both research and industry to avoid the suspicion of corruption in the first place .    3.9250269601421404
a prerequisite for this is the strict UNK of the legal and administrative regulations concerning projects UNK by third - party funds .    3.866174090175427
since the immune system plays an important role in the rejection of tumours , current tumour therapy includes UNK .    3.120312778697142
because the intravenous application of il - 2 may have serious side effects , we treated two patients with peritumoral injections in a pilot study .    3.7819315929398027
both patients suffered from multiple cutaneous metastases of melanoma .    3.3449220367240518
histologically , almost complete necrosis of the tumour was induced .    3.7661829398908266
in comparison with the control specimen , the t - cell - rich infiltrate increased intra - and , in particular , UNK .    3.442262997518234
while the ratio of helper to suppressor t cells remained unchanged , the proportions of nk cells , monocytes / macrophages and il - 2 - receptor - bearing cells increased .    3.216657307523278
this reaction was restricted to treated metastases .    3.194828451629835
no clinical side effects or laboratory changes were registered apart from local erythema and swelling .    3.0449748727897687
wear of the articulating components ( especially pe - uhmw ) of total hip endoprostheses is the most important technical factor limiting the functional lifetime .    3.561200682356772
to minimize wear debris , ceramic heads , according to iso UNK ( al2o3 ) , have been used , from 1969 paired with al2o3 and since 1975 paired with pe - uhmw .    3.000970039061803
al2o3 balls articulating with cups made from cfrp have been in clinical use since 1988 .    3.3102761199692603
the articulating surfaces of retrieved ceramic heads ( al2o3 - UNK ) and cementless cfrp cups ( carbon fiber reinforced plastic , UNK ) were compared using UNK measurement techniques , scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and roughness measurements ( including advanced roughness parameters UNK or UNK according to iso UNK ) .    3.5482677738623902
altogether , the first results of the clinical study showed that the combination al2o3 - ball / cfrp - cup came up to the expected lower wear rates compared with the conventional combinations .    4.130042530677107
the wear rates are comparable with the combination al2o3 / al2o3 without the material - related problems of ceramic components in all ceramic combinations .    3.1455897128248074
two cases where dna typing has been carried out for stain analysis are described .    3.1179474950832446
in both cases y chromosomal str systems have been used in combination with autosomal str systems .    3.3755859511176243
in the first case the dna from the UNK of a female victim with skin particles of the male UNK was typed .    3.912577613763535
the male dna in this mixture of male and female dna could be typed .    3.132056398468196
the excess of female dna in the samples did not UNK the pcr reaction of y - chromosomal systems .    3.190729564648246
in the second case several body parts could be identified to belong to a single male person .    2.876902502848416
the typing of the suspect ' s dna did not give any information because of a family relationship .    3.3754793138759673
different kinds of stains have been analysed with dys UNK i / ii , dys 390 , dys UNK , dys UNK dys UNK and UNK .    2.8937562299165305
two multiplex pcr reactions were carried out to UNK time and stain material .    3.5126476258879307
although the y - chromosomal systems are not as polymorphic as autosomal str systems the analysis of combined UNK can give additional information in forensic UNK .    3.156946203281068
in a prospectively designed randomized study , we compared the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerine and intravenous enalaprilat in the out - of - hospital treatment of 46 hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema ( defined as UNK over both lungs and systolic blood pressure > 200 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure > 100 mg ) .    2.9179325230264066
the out - of - hospital treatment consists of oxygen ( 6 UNK / min ) via a face mask , furosemide 80 mg i . v . , opioids 10 mg s . c . , and either sublingual nitroglycerine ( n = 23 ; initial dose : 0 . 8 mg ; repetitive application of 0 . 8 mg every 10 min until a cumulative dose of 3 . 2 mg ) or intravenous enalaprilat ( initial dose : 2 . 5 mg ; repetitive application of 2 . 5 mg every 30 min until a cumulative dose of 10 mg ) .    3.344903423345433
the aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a reduction of systolic blood pressure below 160 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm hg until admission to the emergency department .    2.9690939233227027
in the emergency room , an arterial and venous blood sample was taken to determine the respiratory ( po2 , pco2 ) and metabolic status ( ph value ; base - excess ; serum lactate ) of the patient .    3.268023438099274
successful antihypertensive treatment was observed in 13 / 23 ( 57 % ) patients of the enalaprilat group and 15 / 23 ( 65 % ) patients of the nitroglycerine group ( p = 0 . 54 ) .    3.6889861837823004
systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission were similiar in both treatment groups ( systolic rr : enalaprilat : 179 [ 31 ] mm hg ; nitroglycerine : 184 [ 38 ] mm hg ; p = 0 . 59 ; diastolic rr : enalaprilat : 96 [ 14 ] mm hg ; nitroglycerine : 101 [ 14 ] mm hg ; p = 0 . 12 ) .    2.4041188920876344
no significant differences were observed between the enalaprilat and the nitroglycerine groups concerning respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission ( po2 : 67 [ 15 ] vs . 64 [ 17 ] mm hg ; p = 0 . 50 ; pco2 : 46 [ 9 ] vs . 47 [ 13 ] ; p = 0 . 75 ; ph value : 7 . 27 [ 0 . 12 ] vs . 7 . 27 [ 0 . 09 ] ; p = 0 . 98 ; be : - 4 . 2 [ 3 . 7 ] vs . - 5 . 7 [ 4 . 1 ] ; p = 0 . 23 ; lactate : 4 . 2 [ 3 . 3 ] vs . 4 . 2 [ 2 . 7 ] ; p = 0 . 98 ) .    3.227569133350525
we conclude that enalaprilat is no substitute for nitroglycerine in the out - of - hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema .    2.447529322740542
paragangliomas of the glomus UNK are relatively rare , but highly vascularized neoplasmas , which develop from UNK .    3.1022280092565677
they can be develop at UNK , but most often in the third or fourth decade of life .    3.444820649832274
paragangliomas grow very slowly and are most always of benign origin .    3.128562718858311
there is a familial predisposition , and an autosomal - dominant transmission is presumed .    3.1962523095119404
they are commonly located in the jugular region ; in rare cases a polytopic manifestation is found .    3.3215034842660294
we describe the case of a 47 - year - old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides .    3.219272332006424
contrast - enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions .    3.0202893758373293
we performed an operative exploration , which showed a highly vascularized tumor .    3.226981908538952
histopathologic analysis revealed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma .    4.116179744076823
using a surgical approach via lateral UNK and thoracotomy the paragangliomas were extirpated .    2.926584574305542
our case report demonstrates the rare polytopic manifestation of paragangliomas .    2.7392585374524896
this perivascular neoplasms have to be removed before haemodynamic complications develop .    3.4682499772604602
the extent of this tumors is clearly illustrated by use of an angiography .    3.1523243120440116
because of the familial predisposition , clinical and radiological examinations of relatives are mandatory .    3.085578659344847
in more than 30 years of development of intensive care medicine ( icm ) , our speciality has acquired moral and ethical UNK , although not without public pressure and discussions .    3.2027479618864034
special UNK dealing , e . g . , with brain death , terminal care , ethics of foregoing life - sustaining treatment in the critically ill , withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation , and other issues have UNK formed in a number of medical societies .    3.369259135117196
international consensus conferences have helped to clarify some of the issues .    3.6451914080768986
with increasing experience , a multitude of ethical problems have arisen in icm that have to be dealt with , such as the issue of quality of life .    3.4238127359701798
what is an UNK life ?    3.920728087320087
are we allowed to make UNK for our patients ?    3.6743856437031277
what is cost - effectiveness in icm ?    3.4974089664039063
for the future , it will likely be necessary to define the patients who should be admitted to an icu more than those who should not be admitted .    3.7730048622328805
an icu treatment UNK index would be directly proportional to the probability of successful outcome and the quality of the remaining life , and would be inversely related to costs for achieving success .    3.495040992303059
the icu outcome with survival , hospital mortality , and follow - up of icu patients is considered .    3.624190161019231
UNK ( do not UNK ) , the dying patient , terminal care , terminal weaning - UNK ( do not treat ) - active and passive euthanasia , living UNK , quality of life , and cost - effectiveness for icu patients are defined .    3.5443351954171356
outcome predictions using scores ( apache iii , saps ii , mpm ) have been developed based on previous experience , but should only be applied to patient groups and for quality assurance in icus .    3.375417493965061
the most frequent and difficult problem in the icu is the vegetative state , which requires an exact diagnosis .    3.099785049887291
the differential diagnosis from other comatose states such as coma , brain death , and locked - in - syndrome is depicted .    3.281822234248953
a consensus was found that the patient may judge to forego therapy ; ethically it is then appropriate to withhold or UNK therapy .    3.3646072244144714
according to the consensus , withdrawing an already initiated treatment should not necessarily be regarded as more problematic than a decision not to initiate treatment .    3.1645850618523808
in my mind , however , there is a great difference between withdrawing or withholding , e . g . , ventilation .    3.3515631682795717
a UNK opinion by some members of the task force stated that hydration and nutrition other than high - technology or parenteral nutrition are key components of patient care , and should not be equated with medical intervention .    3.095159902081145
the ethical problems associated with active euthanasia ( physician - assisted suicide or death ) as UNK in the netherlands are also discussed .    3.482787074071301
in most countries this practice seems unacceptable .    2.8898988785278954
from 30 years experience in icm , there are many more ethical questions and case reports without clear solutions .    3.3557309407532676
legislation and solutions cannot be expected for single patients , but ethics committees could be helpful in decision - making .    3.274249488223294
pseudarthroses of the spine are classified into congenital , acquired non - traumatic , posttraumatic and postoperative ( iatrogenic ) pseudarthroses .    3.313521695584737
the various types of non - unions of the spine are described according to their clinical and radiological appearance .    3.6351473309062947
in line with their clinical importance , special attention with respect to the operative treatment is given to non - union of the axis of c2 and to spondylolysis .    4.086057880854071
for the pseudarthrosis of the dens a posterior fusion according to gallie - brooks is recommended , in UNK without marked UNK a " direct repair " should be considered in young patients .    3.129278111666716
207 osteosarcomas were examined morphologically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the UNK - 86 protocol using representative slides of one whole tumor plane .    3.5048361696661274
the rate of responders 63 % .    3.068635331890964
in relapse - free patients both the whole tumors and the vital areas there of were smaller than in patients with relapse during a follow - up period of 5 years .    3.454636734834779
within the subgroup of osteoblastic osteosarcomas , metastases were observed following smaller tumors than in UNK osteosarcomas .    3.0788178097198804
therefore , in addition to degree of regression , histological subtype and tumor size should be considered in the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcomas .    3.049020663163045
the possibilities of using different material combinations for the replacement of knee joint endoprostheses are very limited .    2.984875720514457
therefore , cobalt - UNK - UNK alloys are currently being used for femoral components and UNK - high molecular weight polyethylene for UNK stressed tibial components .    3.72899063329435
titanium alloys can be considered for the tibial component only .    3.6392639757937113
the fixation of hamstring grafts in acl reconstruction requires a UNK device .    3.2679823947335764
during the process of UNK the graft stability depends entirely on the fixation .    3.43162260257963
the following study focused on the mechanical conditions of no 6 ethibond , 5 mm mersilene tape and 5 mm polylene tape .    2.9970818097332135
the ultimate tension load and elongation of the conditioned and unconditioned loops were investigated under cyclic load of 50 n and 100 n using a tension load machine .    2.702357462412005
the ultimate tension load increased significantly only for mersilene from UNK n to UNK n . however , the highest ultimate tension load showed polylene with UNK n . the oscillating load up to 100 n revealed for unconditioned loops and elongation of 4 . 1 mm for ethibond , 2 . 9 mm for polylene and 5 . 4 mm for mersilene .    3.4847614372586584
the elongation decreased significantly for the conditioned loops to a maximum of 1 . 4 mm .    3.533267503700285
concerning the amplitude during the period of oscillating load there was found a significant reduction as well .    3.5851312203812733
based on our results polylene showed the best mechanical properties .    3.1003384077182847
regardless the intraoperatively used material we advocate the conditioning of the loops before anchoring the hamstring graft in acl reconstruction .    2.7784712896091865
on the basis of the results of UNK knee arthroscopies in children aged between 2 and 17 years in the period from 1985 to 1995 we attempt to evaluate the current status of this procedure .    3.4333452734838725
arthroscopy as a diagnostic intervention in trauma with UNK or in any kind of knee effusion is progressively being replaced by sophisticated ultrasound techniques or mri .    3.4749338410567834
this trend shows a predominant therapeutic use of knee arthroscopy .    2.989161469309371
taking our own " incorrect " clinical diagnoses as a starting point we look at common problems in the accurate clinical examination of the symptomatic knee in younger children .    3.0601442730636523
rational utilization of all kinds of modern diagnostic measures will reduce purely diagnostic arthroscopies in favour of therapeutic endoscopic interventions thus reducing perioperative risks to a minimum .    3.014203803732444
the pathogenesis of cortical blindness as a rare complication in severe preeclampsia is still unclear .    3.1131367836872674
the case of a women with postpartum blindness is reported in which ct and mri initially showed cortical and subcortical edema in the parieto - occipital lobes .    3.0320305159729903
at this time cerebral angiography and transcranial color - coded sonography ( tccs ) revealed widespread cerebral vasospasm .    2.6784704749495547
mean blood flow velocities in the middle and posterior cerebral artery and carotid UNK initially reached 380 cm / s and normalized within 2 weeks .    2.849109866821057
while the patient ' s vision improved rapidly , follow - up mri disclosed ischemic lesions and petechial hemorrhage in the occipital cortex .    3.3128464450759743
this case provides rare documentation that transient blindness in patients with preeclampsia may result from parieto - occipital ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm .    3.18341865754312
in such patients tccs may be useful to detect vasospasm associated with preeclampsia / eclampsia .    3.080983204795978
the principle of photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) for rheumatoid arthritis consists in specifically UNK a drug ( photosensitizer ) in the synovium .    3.110214452115633
subsequent activation of the photosensitizer by means of a laser leads to a cytotoxic effect .    4.143972065442504
the practicability of pdt was tested in an animal model of igg - induced arthritis in rabbits .    3.2264648044473536
photosan - 3 , 5 - aminolevulinic acid and bpd - ma were administered intraarticularly or intravenously .    3.194637648076482
in this model , concentration of the photosensitizer in the synovial lining cells , the lymphoid infiltrate , and the skin was seen .    3.955067164165135
after laser irradiation a selective demarcation and destruction of the synovium by prior administration of photosan - 3 , not constant by bpd - ma and without therapeutic effect by 5 - aminolevulinic acid , was observed .    2.8967837672371237
in contrast , bradytrophic tissues such as cartilage , meniscus , and ligament structures were changed neither macroscopically nor microscopically in all series .    2.623141108354265
pdt thus offers ideal preconditions for minimal invasive treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases because of its UNK and efficacy .    3.437535693975968
photodynamic laser therapy can be considered a new method in the surgical treatment of inflammatory disease of the synovial membrane .    4.382171425406552
the purpose of the study was to identify associations between drug prescriptions and the risk of falls in community - dwelling frail elderly people .    3.034192172089028
enlargement of the prostate is an age - related , physiological process that is unique in human tissue .    3.6910666409119117
the prostate gland is the most common site of neoplastic disorders in men .    3.756512065504198
despite the growing impact of the various prostate diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality , the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia ( bph ) and prostate cancer remains poorly understood .    3.4057734524110557
this reflects the complex composition of the gland with different anatomic , cellular and functional compartments that are differentially involved in benign and malignant disease processes .    3.0225235166541293
the present review summarizes new concepts on the morphogenesis of normal and abnormal growth in the human prostate .    3.121594709428363
there is increasing evidence that prostatic stem cells are located in the basal cell layer that is basically involved in normal growth and the development of glandular hyperplasia and prostate cancer .    3.209175313017402
high - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is considered the most likely precursor of clinically important cancer of the peripheral zone .    3.5482599404908943
severe differentiation and proliferation abnormalities occur during malignant transformation of the prostatic epithelium .    3.075617963374396
these premalignant changes are associated with abnormal expression of growth factor receptors , oncogene and suppressor gene products and genetic instability .    3.0864413920348936
during the process of stromal invasion the transformed cells lose their basal cell phenotype and produce basement UNK - UNK - like matrices .    3.1781209375701596
common prostate cancer is mainly composed of exocrine cell types that remain androgen - responsive even in hormone - independent disease .    2.9218854631577265
the frequent occurrence of neuroendocrine differentiation in common prostate cancer reflects the differentiation potency of its stem cells .    3.006728083888479
the endocrine phenotype UNK from exocrine tumor cells via intermediate ( UNK ) cell types .    3.810445775213156
neuroendocrine tumor cells consistently lack the nuclear androgen receptor and represent an androgen - UNK cell population in prostate cancer .    3.0766005804029195
questionnaires were mailed anonymously to 150 german shock wave centers .    2.6820482971073494
twenty questions addressed the following areas of interest : - facilities of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( eswl ) center ( technical , personnel , laboratory , etc . )    2.720089864064629
- cooperation at eswl center with referring urologists - laboratory facilities versus actual metabolic work - up .    2.6967893437061523
the return rate was 114 of 150 ( 76 % ) .    2.669680844289962
surprisingly , at 58 % of the centers the average number of treatments is less than two per day .    3.5027416060643377
in 30 % of the centers only chemical stone analysis is done !    3.909369955591912
the final conclusion was that eswl has largely replaced the causal metabolic work - up and subsequent metaphylaxis as a symptomatic measure against urolithiasis .    2.9138715558510038
based on current insurance data patients with UNK can be expected to suffer reduced UNK .    3.938300896089689
a prospective study was carried out to test this relationship .    3.614320159642148
in 1970 UNK and harms made fundamental recommendations for the night driving ability of UNK as well as for the corresponding examination methods .    3.3161309988867567
reduced night driving ability of persons over the age of 60 , as well the established limits for UNK vision and glare sensitivity , and their relevance to night - time collisions has been re - examined .    3.512169546662284
hernias of the obturator foramen are rare .    3.352628957464949
often the correct diagnosis is UNK upon as a result of surprising intraoperative findings .    3.5387770676022883
surgical therapy is indicated often by the clinical symptoms of an UNK hernia .    3.8665797364645433
herniation of the entire urinary bladder with hemorrhagic infarction has never been described before .    3.484701774348377
for an anatomical reduction of the hernia it was UNK to UNK the superior pubic ramus .    4.133164901810698
for plastic reconstruction a UNK mesh was used .    3.2349561094750254
acl reconstruction with patellar tendon graft has become a standard procedure .    3.265066376153134
the graft can be inserted either using two UNK and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint , thus avoiding the lateral incision .    3.6186057438865253
advantages of the single - incision technique in the early rehabilitation period have been claimed .    3.673770933407517
40 patients with acl deficiency were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing single and two - incision technique with a follow - up period of 4 years .    3.1996103370512765
preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups .    2.498244072055432
at follow - up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation .    4.153547681050516
evaluation after 1 and 4 years according to the ikdc form revealed good to excellent results in 70 % of all patients .    3.4249136645017155
the tegner - score increased significantly , however most patients did not UNK their former activity level .    3.264770098910909
acl - reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at 6 months follow - up .    3.4021870391755114
however , we observed a slight increase of anterior translation after 1 and 4 years in both groups ; stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods .    3.57587503345815
we conclude that an arthroscopic UNK technique has no advantage compared to a mini - open two - incision technique for acl reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters .    3.0389342436118403
for determining the prevalence of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) in germany , the outcomes of several epidemiological studies are available .    3.7433306775673407
if these rates are transferred to germany as a whole , figures result of 67 , 000 to 138 , 000 ms patients in all .    3.0285567219771705
the differing prevalence rates may be caused by various problems in finding patients , the epidemiological area , and different population structures .    3.6643258648854893
to avoid these difficulties , a new approach for calculating the number of patients with diagnosed ms was chosen based on representative samples taken from the groups of physicians involved in ms treatment .    3.48820416912484
the disadvantage of this approach is that it does not allow any questioning of the diagnosis .    4.018966196330945
UNK the results in this way and their subsequent compilation - taking " double treatments " into consideration - showed a total of 122 , 000 patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis in germany .    3.4781009472757844
this figure corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149 . 1 per 100 , 000 inhabitants and is within the range found by UNK et al .    2.70560397156727
[ 19 ] : 127 per 100 , 000 excluding the diagnostic category " possible multiple sclerosis " and 170 per 100 , 000 including it .    2.914747683752238
the chemical synthesis of alkyl glucuronides , which appear as metabolites in urine after the consumption of UNK containing UNK of ethanol , is described .    3.0933202123923778
glucuronides of the following UNK were synthesized : UNK , UNK - ethanol , UNK , isopropanol , butanol , UNK , r - ( - ) - 2 - butanol , s - ( + ) - 2 - butanol , UNK and s - ( - ) - 2 - UNK .    3.970409294839264
the retention indices of acetyl , UNK ( UNK ) and UNK ( tms ) derivatives are given and discussed in relation to the chemical structures .    3.5588188583138427
mass spectra of homologous derivatives were shown to be very similar but some fragments were specific for the chain length of the alkyl UNK and can be used for identification and a quantitative estimation of glucuronides in urine samples .    3.395927613661588
decreasing numbers of tuberculosis cases in the western countries have led to diminished attention towards this disease .    3.5506166320944206
but worldwide , tuberculosis still is the leading cause of mortality due to any one single infectious agent .    3.237251757563504
the system UNK and the combinations of the systems UNK / UNK and UNK / UNK in duplex reactions were analysed .    4.347037194540284
dna samples could be analysed with a high sensitivity ( 100 pg ) and the results were reproducible .    4.323989984181578
no allele drop - out was observed .    3.1197532536354995
using specific UNK UNK , the inter and intra gel deviation was less than 0 . 5 bp .    4.36453920714879
the allele frequencies , the mean exclusion chance values and the discrimination power for all five systems are shown .    3.2592218359302843
the combination of the five systems resulted in a power of discrimination of 99 . UNK % .    3.0815003030627848
few technological developments have impacted health sciences over the last years like the internet .    3.292424894407442
this comes at a time when electronic acquisition , storage and processing of medical data becomes commonplace in the so - called developed countries .    3.189137678726876
new forms of integrated medical services will eventually evolve from these two trends .    3.008373665366918
for information taken from many medical resources on the internet a relative lack of review processes requires special care and selection .    2.950530995995832
the co - operation of different health providers can be facilitated using technological standards initially established for other purposes .    2.9417425046075207
this article is directed towards the gynecologist interested in practical use of the internet and its technologies and critically reviews the value of sample sites on the net .    3.2151778368141537
the accompanying internet UNK lists relevant resources .    3.0781505575447836
a calculation model was developed for the cost of stone therapy and metaphylaxis in germany based on estimates of stone incidence , types and recurrence rates , actual costs for stone removal and metaphylaxis ( based on data from a district of the social health care system ) .    3.201169283443967
there are 200 , 000 stone recurrences per year in germany .    2.9915631129536293
cost for treatment of these stones amount to $ 687 , 000 , 000 .    3.665745276200322
stone metaphylaxis reduces the recurrence rate by some 40 % .    3.461506619581039
the annual cost for stone removal could be lowered by $ UNK , 300 , 000 .    2.9404098969878842
in 1997 , there were 96 days off - work per stone patient resulting in 5 , 800 , 000 days off - work in germany per year .    2.890123008771953
metaphylaxis in stone UNK can lower health care cost significantly .    3.250129686125258
although health care conditions may vary from country to country , in principle this calculation model is applicable also to other countries .    3.0410959942210276
consideration of estrogen replacement therapy is well established in the treatment of postmenopausal syndrome and osteoporosis in menopause .    3.811930107969058
some observational epidemiologic studies on this topic have suggested beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease .    2.988264506127065
a prospective , controlled , randomized clinical trial with respect to cardiovascular events and mortality in postmenopausal hormone users , the UNK ( heart and estrogen / progestin replacement ) study has recently been published .    3.6758748386639457
improvement in functional state and reduction of stress - induced myocardial ischemia with hormone replacement therapy ( hrt ) have been demonstrated in several clinical trials .    3.504239521565728
inflammatory stimuli induce the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells .    3.056633180889277
the adhesive forces between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium are antagonized by the shear stress of the UNK blood .    3.7981571054893406
the aim of this study was to examine how differences in the apparent wall shear rate measured in iris venules with varying UNK affect leukocyte - endothelium interaction .    2.4718758056045775
radiologic means aid in assessment of the most suitable side for operation and allow the surgeon to be prepared for special situations in order to perform the operation without difficulties [ 22 ] .    3.9570885428278317
the most suitable modalities are ct and mri preoperatively .    3.2070797724054674
in uncomplicated cases , conventional imaging UNK for the postoperative needs .    3.989799258478793
ct should only be performed if the patient complains of symptoms .    3.5526924518136607
systemic immunotherapy , notably with interleukin - 2 ( il - 2 ) and interferon - ( ifn ) , has yielded a response rate of 10 % to 30 % in UNK renal cell carcinoma .    3.1516492014498754
however , systemic immunotherapy is limited by severe side effects , and long - lasting response is rare .    3.9216131959118523
tumor palliation and quality - of - life are important end points for evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy .    3.074281530314661
experimental and clinical treatment models have proved that local il - 2 application is less toxic than systemic treatment and is therapeutically effective .    3.471469148441201
here we report long - term experience with inhalation il - 2 therapy in 188 patients who had progressive pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma .    3.439537468179111
high - dose inhalation of il - 2 was used with low - dose systemic il - 2 or ifn .    3.8861815741451964
maximal toxicity over the total treatment time was mild , and the low incidence of who grade 3 toxicity ( 24 % ) allowed social activities and UNK of social roles .    3.939569536542111
UNK for systemic side effects was required only in half of the patients .    3.1954894510169662
inhaled il - 2 prevented progress of pulmonary metastases in 68 % of patients for a median period of 9 . 8 months .    4.077508422307852
median survival was 12 . 4 months compared with the expected 5 . 3 months and quality - of - life did not differ substantially from pretreatment status .    3.843207912549917
local treatment can be applied alone or in combination with systemic therapy and can increase therapeutic efficacy .    3.6743556705367126
it is now well known that chronic alcohol abuse is an important factor for developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) .    3.3426697915664043
while hospitalized , these patients are at great risk for developing an unexpected alcohol - withdrawal syndrome .    2.9472659963968817
compared to common markers of alcohol abuse , UNK - deficient UNK ( cdt ) has been found to be more sensitive and specific .    3.6649472742874347
it is therefore very useful for detecting alcoholism and controlling compliance of alcohol withdrawal .    2.9426292777829084
we analyzed the serum concentrations of cdt , liver enzymes and mean UNK volume in 49 male patients with hnscc .    3.1632291137273967
elevated cdt levels were found in more than 25 % of patients who earlier denied a history of chronic alcohol abuse .    4.439767224911847
over one - third of these patients developed an alcohol - withdrawal syndrome .    3.4673433575047494
these findings demonstrated that analysis of elevated cdt serum levels was a valuable method for detecting chronic alcohol abuse and UNK patients at risk for developing an alcohol - withdrawal syndrome postoperatively .    2.9881504297941928
apoptosis , or programmed cell death , plays an essential role in specific cell deletion during normal embryonal and adult development .    2.971006131397584
apoptotic cells are characterized by fragmentation of nuclear dna and formation of apoptotic bodies .    3.3805574847602964
molecular genetic analysis has revealed the involvement of several deaths and survival genes that are regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors .    3.009422822290121
there are multiple UNK and inhibitors which interact with target UNK receptors and transduce signals involved in cellular proliferation , cell cycle progression and programmed cell death .    2.7526245256800346
the elimination of tumor cell populations by applying lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation is a well - established strategy in cancer therapy .    2.9683276884801018
although improved cytotoxic chemo - and radiotherapy regimens are available , the efficacy of these strategies is still disappointing with regard to many solid tumors .    3.3884482803142277
better understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis , including death genes , death signals , receptors and signal transduction pathways , will provide new approaches in the development of strategies to regulate malignant cell survival and death .    3.3915944879234976
recent discoveries in the field of apoptotic cell death promise to have a significant impact on antitumor therapies .    3.444536731636149
apoptosis is known to be an active process which can be artificially manipulated by several molecular pathways .    3.7899806853031017
this information concerning the regulation and induction of programmed cell death might lead among UNK , to the development of new powerful means to eliminate malignant cell populations of otherwise resistant genitourinary tumors such as prostate cancer .    3.3063500725526125
we report on a 63 - year - old female patient with UNK - UNK syndrome ( mts ) .    3.003024047663094
in the course of this disease two carcinomas of the colon , a kerato - UNK and multiple sebaceous gland tumours , including four sebaceous gland tumours , including four sebaceous carcinomas , appeared .    3.014861057502469
this case is thought to be a UNK form as one of daughters was also found to have a sebaceous UNK .    3.9173441509009326
mts is a mostly autosomal - dominant disease with the association of sebaceous gland tumours and internal carcinomas .    3.362055960051816
as the malignant tumours only show slight aggressiveness the prognosis is quite favourable .    3.2548496968886447
oral isotretinoin therapy was successfully used for the inhibition of sebaceous gland proliferation .    3.868827599030886
a UNK definition is presented and an updated survey of the published cases is given .    3.34685025532694
furthermore , the histopathologic peculiarities of sebaceous gland tumours , especially of sebaceous gland carcinomas , are discussed and compared to sebaceous gland tumours not connected with mts .    3.265110796028832
a total number of 100 of the 135 published cases of mts were included and analysed regarding sebaceous gland tumours and other skin tumours .    2.9675169596099074
the data on internal carcinomas were taken from the work of cohen et al .    2.9443877405808814
( 1991 ) and 11 current cases were added .    3.4427580628180277
the rapid development of modern endovascular , microsurgical , and radiation therapies has considerably expanded the treatment options for UNK arteriovenous malformations ( avms ) .    2.8610330047658747
surgery has the longest history .    3.4966148733428035
single or staged intravascular procedures ( UNK ) using fast - acting UNK , sclerotic agents , and UNK coils serve to reduce the size of avm to that suitable for extirpation and may reduce the risk of surgery .    4.09536427076221
radiation ( " gamma - knife " ) therapy , most frequently used in small , non - operable avms , is also viewed by some authors as an alternative or even superior tool in small , operable malformations .    3.47560799600449
partial embolization to reduce the mass - effect of space - occupying avms , to reverse UNK , and to treat avm - related seizure disorders is being discussed and practiced .    3.649456812746501
given the in part competing or even controversial options , the selection of optimal treatment for avm patients is becoming increasingly difficult .    3.1263607746219053
current management is UNK by the paucity of information on the exact risks of invasive therapies and by insufficient criteria for identifying patients at risk of spontaneous bleeding during the natural course , including the seriousness of such hemorrhage .    3.608854968023903
a new " all in one " sensing device was developed for continuous UNK intraoperative monitoring and in situ detection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve ( rln ) during thyroid surgery .    3.0605230191151995
patients and methods : the new system is based on a double - balloon endotracheal tube with integrated atraumatic stimulating and UNK electrodes .    3.1350754929684785
the recurrent laryngeal nerve is stimulated UNK and compound action potentials are recorded from the laryngeal muscles .    3.0543405117004645
thirty - five patients with primary thyroid operations , 20 patients with reoperations , 10 of whom had neck dissections .    3.307166533448498
all patients were evaluated laryngoscopically and UNK by an ent specialist before and after surgery .    3.133321709377939
results : compound muscle action potentials were recorded continuously during the whole operation and responded UNK to tension and pressure to the nerve .    2.960094466415851
there were no accidental permanent rln palsies .    2.6396226255193866
conclusion : the new system offers five advantages : ( 1 ) it is atraumatic ; ( 2 ) it is easy to use ; ( 3 ) it can monitor continuously with an audio feedback to the surgeon ; ( 4 ) it works outside the operation field ; and ( 5 ) it is highly sensitive , even indicating reversible irritation to the nerve .    3.467576690806754
the diagnosis of primary malignant bone tumors , which only account for 1 % of malignancies in humans , represents quite a UNK for the pathologist .    3.692983857319889
apart from the often overlapping morphology between different entities , heterogeneity within one and the same tumor has to be kept in mind .    2.822043024202063
furthermore , in most cases the diagnosis must be established based on small biopsy specimens and occasionally even on frozen sections .    2.930936427628419
in this context detailed clinical information including the patient ' s age and exact localization of the tumor , as depicted by x - ray or mri , are essential requirements for a correct diagnosis .    3.494035880608423
in addition , multiple biopsies from different tumor sites may be of help .    3.175974918901033
for example , 25 % of osteogenic sarcomas ( osa ) are UNK .    3.2828172631365815
others may contain areas similar to UNK ( fsa ) or malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( mfh ) .    2.836348841757572
since 90 % of osa occur in the second decade of life whereas chondrosarcomas , fsa and mfh usually manifest after the age of 40 years , a biopsy solely composed of malignant UNK tissue obtained from a tibial lesion of a 10 - year - old child should most likely be considered as part of an osa .    3.6340687427655602
in the differential diagnosis of the so - called small , round cell tumors , which include ewing sarcoma , malignant lymphoma and small - cell osa , immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin - embedded material and a molecular biological / genetic work - up of frozen material are most helpful .    3.283553260642846
in this paper the histomorphological characteristics and criteria for differential diagnosis of the most common primary malignant bone tumors are discussed .    3.3521663441044915
the care of the patient after primary treatment is very important for both tumor control and UNK compliance .    4.1994345039928165
if expensive diagnostics are needed to get this information , it is reasonable to order them .    3.6477405363381608
if there is no benefit for the patient , regarding survival or with respect to quality of life , clinical anamnesis and examination should be preferred .    4.099900689705206
the effect on pain and heat sensation of UNK non - ionic contrast media with different osmolality was assessed in a randomized double - blind study .    2.8757739525625925
peripheral angiography was performed in 29 patients who suffered from chronic occlusive vessel disease .    3.911385971436888
the two non - ionic contrast media iomeprol and iopentol were applied intraindividually .    2.6478610091477868
the contrast media with an iodine concentration of UNK mg / ml had an osmolality of 618 or UNK UNK / kg .    3.6989025185861513
a contrast medium volume of 80 or 90 ml was injected in the abdominal aorta .    3.355333543190263
the mean flow was 13 . 9 ml / s .    3.4680499815983765
the two contrast medium injections were separated by an interval of 10 min .    3.1399564995424667
no analgesic premedication was given .    3.0800515382805065
the pain and heat intensity was UNK measured using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 ( no heat / pain ) to 100 ( intractable heat / pain ) .    2.850903491053999
the median after the first injection was calculated as 40 for iomeprol and 70 for iopentol .    3.206684261287654
the statistical variance was highly significant ( p < 0 . 01 ) in favor of iomeprol .    3.097346331396
shampooing is the most common form of hair treatment .    4.42992008826895
shampoos have primarily been products aimed at UNK the hair and scalp .    3.4174554166485573
the UNK of qualities demanded from a good shampoo by today ' s consumer go far beyond this general function .    2.8580315298595056
a cosmetic benefit is expected , and the shampoo formulation has to be tailored to all the possible variations associated with hair quality ( dry , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ) , age ( baby shampoo ) , care UNK ( frequency of shampooing ) and specific problems relating to the superficial condition of the scalp ( UNK , seborrhea ) .    3.8002604689486605
selected UNK of shampoos that have been popular with the consumer are currently under attack because of potential risks associated with their use ( e . g . halogenated organic compounds , formaldehyde , UNK UNK , and crude UNK tar ) .    3.4072389442961732
we should be increasingly aware that our patients look to us to supply independent information on what can be expected from a shampoo to enable them to make more informed choices at the consumer level .    2.8959298224207535
in industrialized countries the rate of sudden cardiac death remains unchanged .    4.119307993324656
the most frequently encountered structural heart disease in these patients is coronary artery disease .    3.439469367393621
despite the era of thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction patients carry an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmogenic death within a time period of one to two years following the acute event .    3.3260573656255112
therefore , risk stratification post - mi before patient discharge is furthermore mandatory .    2.736938493717141
dysphagia is related to the impairment of food passage from the mouth to the stomach .    3.4411181453731765
globus UNK implies the frequent and often painful sensation of a lump in the throat that usually does not interfere with swallowing and may even be relieved by food intake .    2.8534314136145733
the diagnosis is based upon a careful history , clinical examination , endoscopy , dynamic imaging ( videofluoroscopy , UNK , videosonography ) and electrophysiologic procedures ( including pharyngoesophageal manometry , electromyography and ph determinations ) .    3.2597452343464983
structural lesions of the cervical spine such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis are rare causes of dysphagia .    3.491848755635328
dysphagia following anterior cervical fusion as well as globus and dysphonia due to dysfunction of the vertebral joints are more likely .    3.994728562525366
symptoms with swallowing fluids indicate a neurogenic origin .    3.1772848901226345
UNK swallowing , nasal reflux , dysphonia or general weakness may also occur .    3.027804740224383
chronic aspiration with respiratory UNK is the main consequence in a variety of neurological disorders as well as in cases of postsurgical dysphagia .    4.390697838077334
relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter indicates coordinated muscle movement between the pharynx and esophagus .    3.342212558549814
dysfunction of the pharyngoesophageal segment may lead to cricopharyngeal achalasia .    3.658009083546475
a UNK sphincter commonly represents an UNK cause : i . e . , disease associated with gastroesophageal reflux .    2.993280407957638
disorders of the esophageal phase of deglutition can produce retrosternal pain , UNK , regurgitation and vomiting , as well as laryngeal and respiratory signs .    4.200853696023382
esophageal motility disorders include lower achalasia , tumors , peptic strictures , inflammatory diseases , drug - induced ulcers , rings and UNK .    3.1117415053468913
motility disorders present with UNK , spontaneous contractions , diffuse UNK , or a UNK esophagus .    4.26517034685317
gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis must always be excluded , especially in patients with a globus sensation .    3.9445976279337738
different UNK arthropods and dermatophytes occurring primarily in farm animals may be transmissible to man and produce human dermatoses .    2.637573061303026
the movement and cutaneous penetration habits of external parasites often cause UNK papules , severe itching and dermatitis or may damage their UNK by blood - UNK or by UNK them to their saliva .    3.2808977645489654
furthermore different dermatophytes should be considered a possible cause of human skin lesions .    3.691856434197609
farm animals ( UNK , pig , UNK , and rabbit ) can transmit external parasites ( ticks : UNK UNK , UNK UNK ; UNK : UNK gallinae , UNK UNK , and mites : sarcoptes scabiei var .    4.297610396430727
UNK , sarcoptes scabiei var .    2.5524638187161433
suis , UNK gallinae , UNK UNK ) , and dermatophytes ( trichophyton sp . , and UNK sp . ) .    4.160356235793994
people who have close contact to UNK farm animals are more often exposed to UNK infections .    3.2954391370983536
certain professions , such as UNK , and UNK , are especially vulnerable .    4.296424886948238
between 1992 and 1994 two multicentre studies were performed in order to determine the frequency of sensitization to gold salts .    3.769389206697919
44 patients ( 5 . 1 % ) had a positive patch test reaction to gold salts : 40 ( 4 . 6 % ) to nts 0 . 5 % v . , 20 ( 2 . 3 % ) to nts 0 . 25 % v . and 5 ( 0 . 6 % ) to kdc .    4.151293211311062
a higher number of positive patch tests to gold salts was noted in patients also sensitized to another metal salt ( 8 . 5 % ) as compared to those who showed no other sensitivities ( 3 . 6 % ) .    3.5433712495604097
UNK complications frequently occur during the clinical course in patients with multiple injuries .    4.160619610645436
the increased release of pro - inflammatory mediators during the immunological response to trauma may lead to the systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) and furthermore , to multisystem organ failure ( mof ) , which is associated with a mortality of up to 80 % .    3.1500255853194346
the development of multiple organ failure following major trauma is associated with remote organ failure , the dysfunction of organs which were not initially affected by the UNK .    3.592863702303507
this UNK reviews recent data in experimental trauma research and offers a more detailed evaluation of the immunological findings in trauma patients .    3.2931175249144333
in particular , the role of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines in the development or sirs , mof and UNK is discussed .    3.4544428604653215
despite the enormous progress in clinical immunology and the available data on trauma - induced immune dysfunction , a large number of questions still remain to be answered before the immunological alterations following severe trauma can be UNK influenced by immunomodulatory therapeutic efforts .    3.203443711009184
a report on two cases with benign tumors of the atrioventricular node ( so - called mesothelioma of the av - node or UNK inclusions of the heart ) .    3.551693497847387
in one of the cases the tumor could be the cause of the known electrophysiological disturbance of the conduction system ( av - block ) and of the sudden and unexpected death .    4.123861023931742
a case of delayed death after a low - voltage accident is presented .    3.109418362102757
at first , an obvious source of UNK was not found .    3.3324407147272774
however , electric marks were found on the fingers .    3.10433804070055
the identification of the conductor was performed by analysis of the UNK of the electric marks .    3.9855102165562317
the location of the probable UNK in a UNK under the hand basin and the discovery in a standing position prior to collapse in a UNK indicates that the capability to act was preserved for a short time period .    3.3635454586413873
in such rare cases death seems to be a result of cardiac arrhythmia resulting in ventricular fibrillation .    3.5138123937961865
a 53 - year - old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus .    3.142595686969014
after laser therapy , left lobectomy with UNK resection was carried out .    3.022848412453477
complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty .    3.7233571504902456
based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings , the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma .    2.9696389949483244
there was no past history of an excision or a UNK of a cutaneous , mucous membrane , or ocular lesion .    3.4590567746499867
examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor .    3.2545311205021594
we conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract , a rare neoplasm of which only 21 cases have been confirmed .    3.40886904525036
the patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow - up period of 10 months .    3.561875577889801
background : to find out the incidence of spontaneous pubertal development in girls with turner syndrome we investigated patients with a bone age of at least eleven years .    3.4709964250741114
results : 6 out of 17 patients showed spontaneous puberty .    3.121456665471708
there exists no clear correlation between karyotype and phenotype on the one hand and incidence of spontaneous puberty on the other .    3.308404413403109
basal as well as stimulated UNK levels in the late childhood could better indicate spontaneous puberty in turner syndrome .    3.4963229206843134
conclusion : in contrast to the generally held opinion spontaneous pubertal development is not rare in girls with turner syndrome .    2.723848070534472
therefore estrogen replacement therapy should be started only after it became certain that there will be no spontaneous puberty .    3.1122763624928234
from january 1992 until april 1995 , 31 patients with trans - and suprasphincteric anal fistulae ( transsphincteric n = 21 ; suprasphincteric n = 4 ; transsphincteric in crohn ' s disease n = 6 ) underwent a UNK followed by closure of the internal opening by suture and UNK flap .    3.1189118391852504
all patients had undergone previous operations , some several times .    2.8824267250957862
the recurrence rate of 13 % appeared to be low after a short follow - up .    3.217824773780789
continence was only UNK impaired , although the anal resting pressure and contraction pressure were significantly reduced .    3.217976670357169
in five patients a shortened UNK period was noticed .    3.1050175317442825
also in crohn ' s fistulae the results were equivalent when the surgical treatment was performed in a non - inflammatory period .    4.3461961424636835
staging of malignant tumours of the oral cavity and the oropharynx not only requires far more than a basic knowledge of anatomy and the usual pathways of spread , but also a broad understanding of the diagnostic benefits of current imaging modalities .    3.505178328227459
as radiology should never try to replace histology , the main aim should be precise prediction of tumour margins and UNK of tumour from edema and UNK changes .    3.650245716163335
only then will imaging studies have a significant clinical impact .    3.280047112873953
post - traumatic recurrent dislocation is a major problem in the operative treatment of shoulder dysfunction in young athletes .    3.444987827527319
this prospectively designed study evaluates the long - term results of a modified eden - UNK procedure in young male athletes .    3.35078743423753
the criteria were : capacity in sports , functional limit , and persistent pain .    2.9514022706961964
genuine disorders of the glenoid or muscular imbalance of the shoulder joint were criteria for exclusion .    3.8815063121615316
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which primarily affected the myocardium .    3.1591107863559604
it is characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle that shows normal systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation .    2.654862924225002
the most important complication of hcm , sudden cardiac death , is mainly responsible for a mortality of approximately 3 . 5 % in childhood .    3.28189707846379
while most patients remain asymptomatic for years , there are some reports about patients progressing from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a dilative form within years .    3.3313094507385315
special interest was placed on the assessment of fragment stability with radiological methods for staging related therapy .    3.2852503308209005
od was localized in 46 cases on the femoral condyle and in 26 cases on the talus .    3.4846368340180773
radiological methods were performed simultaneously and shortly before definite arthroscopical therapy .    3.1344389242803765
using conventional radiography , od of the condyles was staged according to the classification of UNK and UNK and od of the talus suggested by UNK and UNK .    3.8114956880569455
mri staging was performed by morphology of the interface of the od .    3.511600988230719
arthroscopical staging based on the classification of UNK .    4.514614878723069
there was an excellent correlation between the stages in mri and arthroscopy , showing correct prediction of stable and unstable fragments in 92 % .    3.2231834712449037
in contrast , fragment stability could not be efficiently assessed by conventional radiology because fragments could be UNK fixed in cases of bony separation .    3.4321146655971297
mri is indicated before performance of staging - related therapy of od to select patients with stable fragments for conservative therapy and those with unstable od for surgical therapy .    3.104375640881702
a case of rupture of the right UNK resulting from blunt trauma with complete intrathoracic dislocation of the right hepatic lobe in a multiple trauma patient is presented .    3.888166183958081
after a primary chest x - ray study had been interpreted as showing right - sided hemothorax , the thoracic drainage tube was UNK placed into the liver .    3.1855188393498874
ct revealed a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture with intrathoracic liver dislocation .    3.2904516103355674
the liver was replaced and the extended dorsal diaphragmatic rupture was closed primarily via an abdominal approach .    3.0600430295897056
problems of diagnosis and operative procedure in rare cases of fresh right - sided blunt traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are discussed .    3.3663000291201977
