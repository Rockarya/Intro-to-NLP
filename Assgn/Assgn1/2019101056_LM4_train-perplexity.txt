although there are a few isolated reports in the literature suggesting that sugar beet pollen is highly UNK , hypersensitivity to components of sugar beet is not a common disease .    2.315719087124656
we report a 29 - year - old man with a history of atopic dermatitis who developed both contact dermatitis and allergic rhinitis from sugar beet pollen through his job in a UNK UNK .    2.337291877760178
establishing nursing science at german universities has become more and more consolidated .    2.4904893659139398
at the beginning of this establishment there was an evident UNK especially compared to angloamerican and scandinavian countries .    2.1863960880618225
today - 1997 - more than 40 nursing science courses exist at german high schools and universities .    1.916970191145992
active glucocorticoids ( gcs ) , such as cortisol or UNK , are a prerequisite for the induction of surfactant synthesis in the fetal lung .    2.8132729740638225
in fetal serum , biologically inactive metabolites ( cortisone or 11 - UNK ) outweigh the active forms .    2.2487441843665175
in this study we demonstrate with UNK cultures of fetal rat lungs that the reductive side of 11 - UNK dehydrogenase ( 11 - hsd ) regulates the intracellular activation of gcs .    1.9927573376266967
the inhibition of 11 - hsd by the UNK extract UNK acid completely inhibits this central metabolism .    2.5247105805780006
on the other hand , gcs induce the reductive activity of 11 - hsd and , therefore , they increase their own activation by positive feedback .    2.053438829785384
in a community sample of 394 UNK aged 61 years and older from east and west germany , diseases , contacts with general practitioners and specialists , the use of medicine , attitudes regarding health and illness , the subjective health , psychic problems , social support , social integration , social burden , and socio - demographic variables were assessed .    2.0147746843293524
based on these data the determinants for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine were analyzed .    2.403529230510902
the results confirmed the frequency of multimorbidity in the elderly ; on average we found three different diseases at the same time for each person .    2.523047378929355
in nearly 10 % of the sample we found seven diagnoses existing at the same time .    2.7663170137897093
88 % had contact with a general practitioner at least once a year , 97 % had contact either with a general practitioner or with a specialist once a year .    2.3822343909956127
55 . 8 % took at least one medicine each day .    2.9630001132483272
the number of diseases existing at the same time was the most determining variable for the contact of physicians and the use of medicine .    2.5572162841293964
furthermore , the elderly had more contact with physicians and took more medicine if they thought they were susceptible to diseases in a high degree , and if they rated their own health as poor .    2.0659023758396593
fewer contacts with physicians and a lower use of medicine were found in those elderly that rated health behavior as little useful , that had low control beliefs regarding their own health , and that experienced only a low degree of health - related limitations in their everyday life .    2.1864829485927073
furthermore , we found a higher use of medicine if there was little social support .    2.557383570481664
there were no significant age - related or sex - related differences regarding the contact of practitioners or the use of medicine .    2.4854466204476298
recent evidence suggests that a pathologic activation of the mucosal immune system in response to antigens is a key factor in the pathogenesis of ibd .    2.596910626011335
furthermore , changes in cell migration and cytokine production appear to contribute to the perpetuation of ibd and the postoperative recurrence of crohn ' s disease .    2.2049658281573894
based on recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of ibd , several new therapeutic strategies are currently being tested in clinical practice , including recombinant anti - inflammatory cytokines ( ifn - , il - 10 , il - 11 ) and inhibitors of cell adhesion molecules ( UNK ) , proinflammatory cytokines ( tnf , il - 12 ) and their receptors ( tnf , il - UNK ) .    2.7553776100655725
dysregulation of apoptosis may play a major role in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .    2.59984974821689
a defective clearance of apoptotic cells or inappropriately high rates of apoptosis may lead to a pathologic accumulation of abnormal cell material with a secondary autoimmune response .    2.210994161191837
experimental findings in apoptotic keratinocytes and c1q knock - out mice suggest an important role of c1q in the clearance of apoptotic cell material .    2.2450831247749217
in addition , there are several links between c1q and sle : most the patients with c1q deficiency develop a sle - like syndrome .    2.1780468756155082
sle itself often causes secondary c1q deficiency and autoantibodies to c1q are detected in almost all patients with active lupus nephritis .    2.298407788901008
these observations suggest a central role of c1q in apoptosis and in the pathogenesis of sle .    2.890813680489192
objective : the aim of this study was to examine the causes and accident mechanisms that lead to injuries in infancy involving UNK and UNK in order to establish strategies for accident prevention .    2.6662675934072544
the discussion about the implementation of telemedicine and UNK and its consequences has been under way for some time now .    2.6327613730157546
the rate at which telemedical applications are being developed , leaves little time for consideration of the economic , scientific and social aspects .    2.112085358221097
there is a need for integration of all the existing fragments into one coherent telemedical concept .    2.2347940972053126
different aspects of telemedical concepts are discussed .    2.5560707299513914
a 34 - year - old woman who was separated from her husband , was killed by him by strangulation and several stab wounds in the chest .    1.9497225047749924
the post - mortem examination was carried out approximately 5 h after death .    2.7373417058526908
at the place of discovery one swab of her right and one of her left neck side were taken .    2.0466424350544528
additionally , a swab was taken out from the front side of the collar of her UNK - neck UNK .    2.2206265659722435
it was obvious that the skin of the neck below the larynx showed a UNK pattern leading to the assumption that the collar was temporarily pressed between the hands of the suspect and the neck of the victim .    2.5153262409893693
dna typing ( short tandem repeat - pcr ) of these swabs led to the detection of mixed patterns for the swabs of the neck and the collar which matched the patterns of the victim and the suspect .    2.5273944889662636
a prospective randomized clinical trial was performed to evaluate the use of self - reinforced absorbable UNK ( biofix ) in the fixation of ankle fractures .    3.415478701000934
the aim of this study was to demonstrate that fixation with biofix rods and screws is as good as the standard a . o . fixation .    2.0424962892635183
the benefits of biofix rods and screws are : a reduction in costs since no secondary operation is needed , prevention of stress - shielding and thereby diminishing the risk of bone porosity .    2.3491988933603154
patients aged between 16 and 75 years old with closed , non - comminuted fractures of the lateral and / or medial malleolus and dislocation of the fracture fragments greater UNK 2 mm were included in the study .    2.7919232596007255
22 patients were treated with biofix rods and screws and the control group of 19 patients with a standard technique .    3.5519341087171967
after 3 , 6 and 12 months , UNK were taken .    3.1892419984179416
at the same time functional results were evaluated following the criteria of olerud and molander .    2.533275518406966
two patients were withdrawn from the trial for non - medical reasons .    2.7616690577826337
22 patients ( 12 from the biofix group , 10 from the ao group ) operated two or more years ago were contacted to see if any complications had occured since they were last seen .    1.9611496207432186
in 4 cases a biofix screw UNK down just beneath the head during insertion .    2.150057718612768
this did not result in an insufficient fixation of the fracture .    3.167401378228967
there were no early post - operative complications .    2.6943496655180046
the functional and UNK results in both groups were equal .    3.168053700426283
in three cases a sterile sinus developed at the site of screw insertion .    2.4815057072241573
biofix rods and screws , made of polylactic acid , are a good alternative for the fixation of fractures of the ankle .    2.9734954173618036
the use of resorbable fracture fixation material has the advantage that a second operation to remove osteosynthesis material is not necessary .    2.2593051559549515
the long term results are good .    3.3794173854052025
there is , however , a possibility of development of tissue reaction to the resorbable material .    2.8527842505066143
in current textbooks of dermatology , lichen amyloidosus is said to be a papular , intensely pruritic type of amyloidosis of unknown aetiology .    2.3343298628294895
when this concept was developed , there was no way of discriminating between the different types of amyloid .    2.735165152856182
it is now known that amyloid in lichen amyloidosus is not derived from immunoglobulins or serum proteins , as it is in systemic amyloidoses , but from keratin peptides of necrotic keratinocytes .    1.9809589712980884
even several years ago , chronic scratching was UNK as a possible cause of damage to keratinocytes in lichen amyloidosus .    2.4953750269707693
in support of this hypothesis , four cases are presented .    2.592270654971533
apart from amyloid in the papillary layer , all biopsy specimens revealed histopathological signs of chronic scratching ( epithelial hyperplasia with UNK and UNK UNK , UNK collagen in vertical UNK in the stratum UNK ) , such as are also found in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus .    2.69304660902409
lichen amyloidosus is considered to be a variant of these conditions .    3.3107618760159174
just as in prurigo nodularis and lichen simplex chronicus , pruritus seems to be the cause and not a symptom of the papular skin lesions .    2.2272131594706033
consequently , treatment of lichen amyloidosus should not be directed at removing amyloid , but at improving the pruritus .    2.3719218711358216
they can be treated effectively by the dermatologic surgeon with a fairly simple operative procedure .    2.3583181363761607
the removal of the ulcer together with the extensive UNK by UNK knife ( shave - therapy ) and immediate grafting with a UNK split skin graft - possibly in combination with ligation of insufficient UNK veins - yields very good success rates .    2.384080113488073
the results in 13 patients ( 18 legs ) with an average follow up period of 11 months ( up to 20 months ) are reported .    3.2185479211657637
the literature from 1990 - 1997 and 3 personal cases are reviewed to give an update on findings and current therapy for adder bites .    2.146615707551352
bites of the adder ( vipera berus ) are rare .    2.3100248195738473
symptomatic treatment usually leads to complete restitution , death due to adder bite is rare .    2.0870437990687556
the main venom effect is the development of - sometimes severe - edema , hemolysis and disseminated coagulopathy , very occasionally followed by lethal renal failure .    2.0935583529901267
significant intoxication is very unlikely if 2 - 3 h after the incident , no signs of intoxication can be found .    2.440976269469772
background : the use of high - UNK communication is undoubtedly growing and has become established in almost all sciences and research fields .    2.4191182954067636
this article surveys the possibilities for scientific data - exchange via the internet , the world ' s largest computer network .    2.0318834917927737
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ssri ) are known to exhibit far less cardiac side effects than tricyclic antidepressants .    2.1710928288192295
we report three cases in which the ssri , UNK , induced clinically relevant ecg changes in patients with high risk profile .    3.0895830792892793
in two cases an increase in qtc time was observed , severe bradycardia was also observed twice .    2.571420565866373
objective : cultural detection of UNK UNK is not very helpful in the management of patients with whooping cough , since culture takes three to five days until results are available , and only about 30 - 60 % of patients may be detected by this method .    3.090987132852602
in order to improve the laboratory diagnosis of whooping cough , different protocols for the polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) were developed .    2.185129646689814
to answer this question we compared mean slow - phase velocity ( spv ) using three different recording techniques : electro - oculography ( eog ) , video - oculography ( vog ) and infra - red oculography ( irog ) during four different types of examinations .    1.8373156795833179
the examinations were the eye target tracking test ( ett ) , horizontal and vertical UNK nystagmus ( okn ) tests and the rotating chair test of the horizontal UNK - ocular reflex ( UNK ) .    1.8790283016594191
for the ett tests the vog provided consistently higher mean spv values with low variance , presumably because of the accuracy and stability of the calibration .    2.347602435147662
for the horizontal okn and UNK rotating chair tests no significant differences were found between the mean spv obtained with the different recording techniques , although the irog recordings were associated with a larger variance .    2.552744939283069
vertical okn mean spv was consistently lower with irog and vog techniques presumably because of non - UNK and resolution limitations inherent in these techniques .    2.3487746543756822
these results indicate that the eog technique despite its disadvantages of noise , time to apply and variability of calibration still provides an inexpensive , reliable and accurate means of measuring slow - phase eye movements .    2.07030732284529
aim : the aim of this study was to investigate whether the plasma levels of the circulating adhesion molecules UNK - 1 and se - selectin could serve as early predictors of developing sepsis and its severity .    2.227529098203616
problem : the data model given in the dicom standard is examined UNK the aspect of system integration .    2.227160976231071
UNK properties of the UNK ( information object definitions ) and their relationships are investigated .    3.3661453076459527
thoracic disc herniation is rare .    2.6051894852986353
pain is the most common initial symptom , followed by sensory disturbances and motor involvement .    2.9545537539929616
by the time of diagnosis , 90 % of the patient have signs of spinal cord compression .    3.648109033203815
a 42 - year - old woman was operated on because of shoulder pain .    2.7126778841523764
during her stay in hospital , the patient first demonstrated uncharacteristic pain and after UNK an incomplete paraplegia caused by herniation of the t10 / 11 disc .    2.2724714290984336
aim of this study is to investigate the UNK of the quadriceps tendon by injection techniques and immunohistochemical methods ( antibodies against laminin ) with regard to the pathogenesis of tendon degeneration .    3.2072893502537667
the blood supply of the quadriceps tendon arises from descending branches of the lateral circumflex femoral artery , by branches of the descending geniculate artery and by branches of the medial and lateral superior geniculate arteries .    2.4872169603236833
blood vessels penetrate the tendon from the surrounding connective tissue and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network .    2.051610157028596
compared to the surrounding synovial layer , the amount of vessels in the tendon substance is greatly reduced .    2.592692131900107
the distribution of blood vessels within the quadriceps tendon is not homogenous .    2.734900310738065
the anterior or superficial part of the tendon has a complete vascular network that extends from the UNK - UNK junction to the patella .    3.0007527640761107
within the deep portion of the quadriceps tendon there is an oval shaped avascular area which measures app .    2.425914939216925
30 mm in length and app .    2.624922446665313
within this area the immunohistochemical proof of laminin is negative .    2.26908151454702
an explanation for the absence of blood vessels may be compressive stress caused by the patellar groove which serves as UNK for the quadriceps tendon when the knee is flexed .    2.6219135508428804
the occurrence of an avascular zone within the deep layer of the tendon that is directed to the joint cavity may explain the frequency of degenerative changes in this region .    2.4620413223321687
when looking for the possible cause of distortions in values measured for the determination of breath ethanol concentration ( bec ) in artificially respirated patients , consideration must be given to the UNK and temperature of the gas examined .    2.408576994798737
total or partial relapses after conventional surgical advancement of the maxilla following le fort i osteotomy in clp patients are frequent and major complications .    2.102083353726439
the aim of this investigation was to find out whether the technique of distraction osteogenesis in these patients shows more stability and whether maxillary distraction is able to replace conventional advancement .    2.3775722903020853
maxillary distraction was performed in 12 patients .    3.7696548282416007
in two cases , a UNK mask was used to bring the maxilla forward , ten patients were treated with the extraoral distraction device designed by UNK .    2.678995789505495
in all patients , planned advancement of the maxilla could be achieved ; one partial relapse occurred .    2.47197800406733
the results indicate that distraction osteogenesis offers the possibility of advancement of the maxilla with the required stability .    2.49021715866565
the technique presents a major improvement which is achieved with a relatively minor surgical procedure .    2.257604009826964
we report a rare case of primary UNK neuroectodermal tumour of the bladder in an adult .    2.5793515305156887
a huge tumour with extensions into pelvic and retroperitoneal tissue was found radiologically in a 62 - year - old man .    2.244276504444882
the patient did not complain about remarkable clinical symptoms until 4 days before admission to hospital .    2.077144912435311
histology of diagnostic transurethral tumour resection showed a small round - cell tumour with focal necrosis and scattered homer - UNK UNK .    2.079983038402894
immunohistochemical analysis revealed that tumour cells stained positively with UNK , a monoclonal antibody which recognizes the membrane glycoprotein UNK / UNK .    2.6597405370005953
focally , tumour cells stained positively for vimentin , nse , s - 100 protein and UNK .    2.281103472466533
the patient died 3 weeks later because of fulminant pulmonary embolism and autopsy revealed a huge , partly exophytic but mainly UNK tumour of the bladder with extensions into the rectum and retroperitoneal tissue .    2.1877839944530715
the differential diagnosis of small round - cell tumours in this location is discussed .    2.486618130571681
lesions of the acetabular labrum should be treated by correcting the causes .    3.235625222079561
in a steep acetabulum where the femoral head brings the acetabular labrum under tension and traction , the acetabulum should be UNK by triple pelvic osteotomy to slightly overcorrected acetabular measurements .    2.1582220561761645
severely diminished acetabular and femoral anteversion can also lead to tears and impingement of the labrum .    2.1433531557488217
then rotation of the femoral neck and / or UNK of the acetabulum by triple osteotomy to 15 - 20 ° of anteversion are indicated .    3.2814458460443183
our triple osteotomy technique differs from that of others mainly in the ischial osteotomy .    2.2911850049079994
it is performed from the posterior approach between the sciatic notch next to the ischial spine and the obturator foramen and is directed 20 - 30 ° anteriorly from the frontal ( coronal ) plane .    2.0023244719041067
the osteotomies therefore are placed close enough to the acetabulum to allow free rotation , but they do not interfere with the circulation of the acetabulum , and the ligaments between the sacrum and UNK are left in normal tension .    2.4314020157494003
our normal values of the acetabular position were tested by correlating the measurements with the absence of pain .    2.644051136991894
the optimum is reached with a ce angle and a vca angle of 30 - 35 ° , an angle of the weight - bearing zone of + 5 to - 5 ° and a migration index of 10 - 15 % .    2.0097397863598494
UNK again caused pain and should be avoided .    2.92019714410129
in earlier follow - ups of 216 hips 5 - 10 years postoperatively , 82 . 3 % of the joints showed no change in the degree of osteoarthrosis .    3.0889888098461844
survival rate curves regarding the absence of pain demonstrated that pain was experienced again when joints were corrected insufficiently or overcorrected , while in good corrections the joints were free of pain in about 75 % .    2.170557174290713
background : leber ' s hereditary optic neuropathy is associated with point mutations in the mitochondrial dna ( mtdna ) that appear to be pathogenic for this disease .    2.235234525177704
these mutations affect nucleotide positions UNK , 11 778 and 14 UNK .    2.129490905531234
heparin - induced thrombocytopenia type ii ( hit type ii ) is an immunoglobulin - mediated , drug - induced side effect for heparin - treated patients with thromboembolic complications .    2.5641989008428445
with an incidence of 1 - 3 % , mortality of 20 % it and permanent disability for another 20 % is a clinically relevant disorder .    2.6742691545404327
with heparin treatment or prophylaxis frequent platelet count monitoring is necessary .    2.2027666297933197
if hit type ii is suspected , further heparin exposure is to be stopped immediately and another anticoagulant therapy should be started .    2.6076665952768368
the two anticoagulant options in germany are discussed .    2.5580625014883225
at the same time the diagnosis should be confirmed by laboratory testing , including testing for cross - reactivity with danaparoid .    2.3259733065138746
further therapy depends on the symptoms .    3.2239248292376965
in the case of clinical relevance of this disorder we should think about prophylaxis : strict indications for perioperative prophylaxis only use of low - molecular - weight heparin ( lmwh ) for routine prophylaxis , use of lmwh for thrombosis treatment and early change to UNK .    2.0435419259413017
a patented low - temperature polymerization method for UNK ( mma ) infiltrated bone marrow biopsies is described : it has been developed from our previous mma technique and is a patented procedure .    2.2239682572544863
differences from the previous method are ( 1 ) removal of UNK from the mma UNK before its application , ( 2 ) the use of a different starter , ( 3 ) avoidance of o2 influence during polymerization by means of vacuum exchange with n2 , and ( 4 ) UNK in a water bath to draw off residual heat .    2.6630463753885736
after this procedure , all immunohistochemical reactions are possible provided that the previous fixation is adequate .    2.393875999704698
the effects of different UNK are reviewed briefly without detailed analysis .    2.8743817300548145
technically , this plastic embedding can be performed at least as rapidly as the classic paraffin embedding after decalcification .    2.3625777475673138
the advantages over the latter method are : ( 1 ) the cells can be better differentiated because semi - thin sections can be made ; ( 2 ) the immunoreactions can also be performed on the basis of semi - thin sections , which means they can be interpreted more easily ; ( 3 ) morphometric analyses yield more reliable results because of the constant thickness of sections ; ( 4 ) UNK examination of bone trabeculae , especially the search for mineralisation deficiencies , is possible ; ( 5 ) the plastic embedding procedure is less dependent on individual instabilities in the quality of performance of the staff members involved .    2.3906640942281916
furthermore , it is worth mentioning that the costs for additional equipment necessary remain below dm 100 , 000 including an excellent UNK .    2.131727042305636
initial studies have suggested that a combination of propofol and alfentanil without a muscle relaxant can provide good intubating conditions .    2.3035047088727256
however , most of these initial studies either did not have a double - blind design or did not include a control group with muscle relaxants .    2.614652472926751
in this study , intubation conditions using fentanyl / propofol without a muscle relaxant were compared with the combinations of fentanyl / propofol / succinylcholine and sodium thiopental / succinylcholine .    2.1690253335002554
nosocomial pneumonia is still a common problem , especially in intubated and mechanically ventilated patients .    3.0691036890896095
the endotracheal tube contributes substantially to the pathogenesis of pneumonia in these patients , because it facilitates UNK and UNK host defense .    3.2250129019821374
common nosocomial pathogens like UNK UNK are known to produce UNK and generate a complex biofilm structure , which allows adhesion to UNK surfaces and protection against antibiotic action .    2.2532272791788466
multiple studies have identified bacterial biofilm on the inner lumen of endotracheal tubes , which represents a permanent source of infectious material .    2.047273450605674
endotracheal tubes , removed from patients with ventilator - associated pneumonia , are covered more frequently with biofilm than those of uninfected controls .    2.1165636512050714
it remains unclear whether this represents a source of infection or contamination .    2.3988015841109736
bacterial biofilm , however , may play an important role in recurrent pulmonary infections of the intubated and mechanically ventilated patient .    2.614141967719022
computer - guided robot - assisted surgery in cementless total hip replacement requires exact preoperative planning at the 3d workstation orthodoc .    2.2180957125853036
only the robodoc procedure allows the precise UNK of the preoperative plan in surgery .    3.069393201291158
in all UNK patients , the preoperative plan was successfully carried out intraoperatively .    3.040249564184136
the high precision in reaming , leading to a UNK bone implant contact , UNK absolute initial stability and is likely to promote primary healing between implant and bone .    2.289842584674731
the common and often published incidence of varus or valgus malpositioning and any fractures or fissures could be avoided through the use of robodoc .    2.219513153942095
although immediate full - weight bearing was strongly recommended to the patients , no implant UNK was seen in the regular follow - up x ray studies .    2.886588129773315
in this study we describe 22 cases of retrograde ureteral stent placement in pregnant women with therapy - resistant flank pain due to hydronephrosis .    2.1006151817112735
eleven were UNK and one patient expected twins .    3.0756319568981825
eight of 22 patients presented symptoms of pyelonephritis .    2.562740441602706
in 21 cases the hydronephrosis was located on the right and in 4 cases it was bilateral .    2.858830945768957
maximal lower UNK diameter was 12 mm ( range 9 - 22 mm ) .    2.2970366942903535
with the exception of two cases , sonographically controlled stent placement was performed under local anesthesia without sedation .    2.3064587310134956
all patients were painfree within 6 days and were given prophylactic low UNK of antibiotic until the day of delivery .    2.1837162950297695
renal function remained within the normal limits .    2.6141822319274586
double - j stent displacement occured in 3 patients - of which one underwent nephrostomy .    2.386557086243399
postnatal examination demonstrated urolithiasis in 4 of 19 patients .    2.565292827212056
this study provides evidence for effectiveness of retrograde ureteral double - j stent placement as a therapeutic option in cases of severe symptomatic hydronephrosis during pregnancy with a low morbidity rate .    2.3991635552279047
between 1981 and 1994 at the bergmannsheil ruhr university hospital in bochum , germany , we treated 145 patients with femoral diaphyseal nonunions following initial operative treatment .    2.370671557053829
of these patients , 138 received this initial operative treatment at an outside institution .    2.595406815181926
the primary reconstructions for the fractures utilized plates in 112 cases , reamed nails in 24 cases and external fixators in 9 cases .    2.0110973254095805
the average age of the patients was 35 years and the mean time from the initial operative treatment was 2 years .    3.1143728911664623
twenty - seven patients ( 19 % ) presented with a hypertrophic nonunion and 118 ( 81 % ) with an atrophic nonunion .    2.614924195413403
there was a significant correlation between primary " classic " plating and development of an atrophic nonunion ( 2 - test : p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.4066616181014333
we observed 34 wound infections ( 23 % ) with no significant correlation to the type of primary osteosynthesis .    3.023035658017927
we determined that 73 of the pseudarthroses were due to UNK osteosynthesis techniques .    2.445682186690127
of these cases , 41 % involved the use of plates , 83 % involved the use of reamed nails , and 78 % involved the use of external fixators .    2.7482627527694268
fracture location near the diaphyseal - metaphyseal junctions was common in this problematic group .    2.033310212362055
ninety - two percent of all plates led to atrophic nonunions .    2.293519597659431
there were 21 open fractures and of these 90 % ( n = 19 ) developed an atrophic pseudarthrosis and 29 % ( n = 6 ) developed a wound infection .    2.3947244311500184
fifty - seven ( 39 % ) of all patients had additional injuries , but we found that did not increase the risk of disturbed bone healing .    3.0231013332965313
our revision operations focused on the elimination of wound infections , UNK of bone healing , and improvement in fragment stability .    2.8984769076792007
only 28 % of all " classic " plates and 11 % of all external fixators were changed to an intramedullary implant at the time of the first revision surgery .    2.9190299365848573
hypertrophic nonunions required a mean of 1 . 3 revision operations to achieve bone healing whereas a mean of 2 revision operations were necessary to fuse atrophic bone ends ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.162511250972522
in cases of diaphyseal pseudarthrosis healing time was not affected by the type of osteosynthesis used for primary reconstructions .    2.484039078467168
since lack of fracture healing can often already be observed directly from postoperative x - rays , we recommend that revision procedures be performed early .    2.2937291340429384
the prolonged length of time to care for femoral nonunions underlines the importance of appropriate primary fracture treatment .    2.246939739458824
that takes into consideration both the biomechanical and the biological aspects of bone healing .    2.517364289393335
background : in a prospective trial ( october 1996 - april 1998 ) the effect of octreotide and tamoxifen on the recurrence of pancreatic carcinoma after r0 resection was evaluated .    2.4542455712991424
methods : patients with a local recurrence after curative resection of ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas were treated with 100 µg of octreotide three times a day and tamoxifen 20 mg once daily .    2.553089071845185
the median survival time , quality of life ( eortc - qlq - 30 ) and side effects of the octreotide - tamoxifen group were compared with a historic cohort ( n = 14 ) of patients treated in our department ( 9 / 95 - 9 / 96 ) according to the " best supportive care " concept .    2.642371128877538
results : recurrences were diagnosed after r0 resection in a mean time of 13 + / - 6 . 8 months .    2.6734285685110355
patients treated with octreotide and tamoxifen had a significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) longer median survival time ( 7 months ; range : 3 - 12 ) vs 3 . 5 months ; range : 1 . 5 - 5 ) .    2.9395772878296165
the octreotide - tamoxifen group suffered less from lack of appetite , nausea , fatigue , and pain and needed fewer UNK .    1.9873406839513008
the only side effect of the octreotide - tamoxifen therapy was moderate UNK in 2 patients at the beginning of the therapy .    2.79797962742409
conclusion : since combined therapy with octreotide and tamoxifen can be administered UNK for outpatient treatment , this seems to represent progress in the palliative therapy of pancreatic cancer .    2.29830211625748
objective : to study the influence of dopexamine on pulmonary shunt and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction during major thoracic surgery with one - lung ventilation ( olv ) .    2.3135471105059127
design : prospective , randomised , placebo - controlled study .    2.6278430075565904
patients : twenty adult patients undergoing elective pulmonary resection .    2.4641020369230513
anaesthesia : general anaesthesia was performed using propofol , fentanyl , n2o and vecuronium . volume - controlled ventilation was performed to maintain normocapnia over the whole investigation period .    2.348548212036547
during olv , the tidal volume was reduced and the respiratory rate was increased to avoid a peak airway pressure exceeding 40 cm h2o .    2.134686416548127
furthermore the fio2 was increased to 1 , 0 and the external peep was removed during olv .    2.4851869804533355
interventions : the patients received either dopexamine at 2 µg / kg / min ( group a , n = 10 ) or 0 , 9 % saline as control ( group b , n = 10 ) after assessing the baseline values .    2.7044650281950693
measurement and results : the following cardiorespiratory variables were recorded : heart rate , mean arterial pressure and mean pulmonary arterial pressure .    2.69143023629694
cardiac output was measured by thermodilution using a continuous cardiac output thermodilution catheter .    2.349769687538546
arterial and mixed venous blood gas analysis were measured from simultaneously drawn samples .    2.432163961723721
cardiac index ( ci ) , systemic vascular resistance index , pulmonary vascular resistance index , oxygen delivery index ( do2i ) , oxygen consumption index and the venous admixture were calculated using standard formula .    2.123954019391966
furthermore , pressure - flow - curves were constructed to analyse flow independent changes in the pulmonary vascular resistance .    2.4798136077657094
data were recorded at the following times : after induction of anaesthesia in stable haemodynamics during two - lung ventilation ( baseline values , t0 ) , intraoperatively during one - lung ventilation ( t1 ) and postoperatively after re - establishing two - lung ventilation ( t2 ) .    2.026127073062655
patients characteristics , data from the preoperative lung function testing and surgical procedures did not differ significantly between the groups .    2.6443342253250384
ci increased in the dopexamine group from 2 , 5 + / - 1 , 2 l - min - 1 - m - 2 ( t0 ) to 3 , 6 + / - 0 , 9 l - min - 1 - m - 2 ( t1 ) and 4 , 0 + / - 1 , 3 l - min - 1 - m - 2 ( t2 ) .    2.745855457430297
the course of the intrapulmonary right - to - left shunting did not differ between the groups .    2.676886550299681
in the dopexamine - treated group the do2i increased from 430 + / - 143 ml - min - m - 2 ( t0 ) to UNK + / - UNK ml - min - m - 2 ( t1 ) and 653 + / - 207 ml - min - m - 2 ( t2 ) .    2.218032950649495
regarding the pressure - flow - curves there was no difference during olv between the two groups indicating no major blocking effect of dopexamine on hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction .    2.316007007740094
conclusion : it is concluded that dopexamine can be used to improve haemodynamics and oxygen delivery during thoracic surgery without increasing venous admixture during one - lung ventilation .    2.236431145021427
functional cine mri of the pelvic floor is a yet another modality in addition to various radiological UNK techniques .    2.5003325895252884
this article describes our own method in view of the recent UNK and provides morphometric reference values .    2.3354050149367733
background : the influence of cyanosis , and cardiac index in children with cyanotic heart disease on their growth velocity .    2.5021658647934646
regular examinations of prostitutes may reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted diseases in this high risk group .    2.6502638037039543
therefore since april 1988 regular mandatory examinations have been offered by the regional health office in cooperation with the department of dermatology of the ruhr - university of bochum .    2.107675328006708
the aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance and efficiency of such an examination .    2.250817899891254
the study was based on anonymous questionnaires .    2.9668590909958774
mean age of the 80 prostitutes was 31 . 4 ; 67 of then were born in germany .    2.312012740342452
78 of the women always used condoms , while 71 thought that condoms prevent stds .    2.166728322071168
three women suffered from a std in the last 12 months .    3.251935827109644
the majority the women ( 75 from this 80 prostitutes ) did not perceive the examination as discrimination , while 71 felt the examinations were of high quality .    2.0775068633316236
atrial fibrillation and related arrhythmias are common after cardiac surgery .    2.5577369394882683
as more and more elderly patients are operated on for cardiac diseases , the interest in this arrhythmia is growing again .    2.4631715554299194
there are some unresolved problems of this complication .    2.5302960328423403
reevaluation of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery by review of recent literature .    2.768874801430023
usually postsurgical atrial fibrillation is transient , self - limiting , and benign .    2.7554931804946046
nevertheless , among patients affected by this arrhythmia , morbidity , mortality and costs by hospital stay are higher than without this complication .    2.1010729098405108
in addition , postsurgical atrial fibrillation can increase morbidity and mortality by itself .    2.3624480217831794
today , general recommendations for prevention of atrial fibrillation following surgery do not exist but may be developed in the future .    2.7459845074196885
according to the clinical course , therapy has to consider ventricular rate control , prevention of thromboembolic events , and rhythm control .    2.621185253864737
usually therapy is restricted to the postoperative time .    2.81267860231486
atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery has to be respected in order to minimize overall complication rate .    3.186191321068709
the influence of aspirin treatment on UNK is still under debate .    2.5573595321032982
there are doubts in emergency operations , especially in transplant patients , concerning dosage and change in medication .    2.3630067472080443
our results are based on an analysis of the therapeutic approaches in german transplantation centres .    3.356500722585341
the question of transplant suitability , dosage and haemostatic effects are discussed with respect to the literature .    2.5291930106227882
some 92 . 11 % of the transplantation centres perform the operation even though the patient has been treated with aspirin .    3.0401713070411507
in these cases an increased bleeding tendency is tolerated and observed in 34 . 2 % of the centres .    2.6898352518722124
an increased mortality has not been reported .    3.039145201309098
most of the transplantation centres accept a dosage of 100 mg aspirin daily .    2.4758388503554722
only 7 . 89 % of the transplantation centres refuse to operate on aspirin - treated patients .    2.70485092568831
correctly indicated aspirin treatment ( for cardiac arrhythmia , embolism , or thrombosis , for example ) does not UNK renal transplantation ( daily dosage up to 100 mg ) .    2.214222417254643
in elective surgery , however , a preoperative change in medication is recommended , e . g . , the heparin instead of aspirin .    2.8172095556443817
full - thickness defects of the thoracic wall following tumor resection , irradiation damage or secondary wound healing in thoracic surgery require early interdisciplinary cooperation to achieve patient - specific treatment modalities .    2.198148267873967
plastic surgical differential therapy allowing for sufficient soft tissue coverage , stabilisation of the thoracic wall and space filling in intrathoracic cavities , is presented and critically discussed .    2.148192094530956
incomplete anaesthesia is a major clinical problem both in single spinal and in single epidural anaesthesia .    2.3140495783937522
the clinical efficacy of epidural anaesthesia with augmentation ( UNK ) and combined epidural and spinal anesthesia ( UNK ) for cesarean section was investigated in a prospective randomized study on 45 patients .    2.8117980404581777
this retrospective study presents the results of 41 patients with a lateral clavicle fracture eight years after the treatment at the UNK orthopädische UNK of the UNK UNK in the time between 31 . 10 . 1979 and 31 . 10 . 1994 .    3.6133405479433875
it could be shown that the lateral clavicle fractures , due to their variety , hold a special position among the clavicle fractures and thus need a UNK therapeutic procedure .    2.299973504838261
among the operation methods the k - wire UNK with cerclage was the most often chosen operation technique i . e .    2.28984622544036
the k - wire without cerclage was used in two cases .    2.9085736728612948
UNK fractures were treated with ao - plate - osteosynthesis .    2.8465063866561766
three fractures had to be treated by resection , as they produced two pseudarthrosis and one serious ac - arthrosis during the conservative therapy .    2.3954198543170255
92 , 7 % of the subjective results of the 41 checked up patients were good and very good .    3.1772499490001587
insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and multiple sclerosis are thought to stem from UNK processes .    2.298548256571849
we describe a 14 year old female adolescent , in whom both diseases manifested almost at the same time .    2.4909345311384903
a prospective long - term follow - up study in patients who had had surgical therapy for renal hyperparathyroidism was UNK to investigate the results of surgical treatment and to evaluate possible correlations between preoperative laboratory values and the course of the symptoms .    3.1979848330752683
from august 1987 to december 1995 , 79 patients underwent surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism .    2.5423657094429806
it was the first neck exploration for 72 patients .    2.4995606592123294
total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation to a forearm was our preferred procedure ( n = 67 ) .    2.429712078680041
the postoperative course of all patients is known .    3.0821235971886494
we carried out one to nine UNK ( median 4 ) in 74 of 79 patients .    2.278430999675906
the follow - up period ranged from 1 month to 5 years with a median of 18 months .    2.829986864296284
within the first month after surgery 60 % of the preoperatively affected patients completely recovered from pruritus , whereas the skeletal syndrome took longer to disappear .    2.570229688605444
one year after surgery 75 % of the patients with pruritus and 79 % of those with skeletal syndrome had became asymptomatic .    2.644793149270498
after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation , patients with preoperatively elevated concentrations of alkaline phosphatase ( > 200 u / l ) experienced faster relief from joint pain than patients with preoperatively normal concentrations ( p = 0 . UNK ) .    2.1817881374231733
to date 4 . 5 % of the patients developed recurrent hyperparathyroidism after total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation .    2.8802736448774096
morbidity of surgery for renal hyperparathyroidism is influenced by patients ' risk factors .    2.584343709094976
postoperative hypocalcaemia correlates negatively with the grade of renal UNK at the time of operation .    2.8104762068569937
preoperative concentrations of alkaline phosphatase influence the rapidity of the relief from joint pain .    2.1443590643254438
coronary artery stenosis with need for therapy is rarely seen in childhood .    2.59286955620743
a 15 - year - old girl with hypercholesterinaemia type ii a was undergoing lipid UNK therapy ( once or twice a week ) since she was 6 years old .    2.218941574282454
single stage UNK with an UNK patch graft of penile skin or buccal mucosa is an effective treatment for patients with complex anterior urethral stricture disease .    2.580671345556663
using buccal mucosa , operative time is substantially reduced by using a two - team approach in which one team UNK the graft from the mouth while a perineal team simultaneously exposes and UNK the stricture .    2.214773221046777
excellent results can be expected using grafts urethral substitution in men with refractory bulbar strictures .    2.3866352716127106
focal areas of severe stenosis may be excised from the graft bed .    2.305784445945663
for patients with long or dense strictures , grafts may easily be combined with other tissue transfer techniques .    2.5509691957414327
background : as the slit - lamp technique is an restrictive method for the in - vivo examination and documentation of the multi - layer structure and the dynamics of the tear film and the cornea , e . g . during wound - healing processes , our aim was to find out whether it is possible to change the confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope ( UNK ; zeiss ) into a high - resolution confocal laser scanning microscope ( UNK ) for the visualization of the anterior segments of the eye and the tear film by adapting a special objective system .    2.3892230566523747
in order to gain information concerning the function of such a cornea microscope we examined selected patients with erosion or pterygium before and after operation and subsequent UNK keratectomy ( UNK ) , as well as some in - vitro corneal surfaces after photorefractive keratectomy ( prk ) .    2.6481105414702983
from 3 years ' experience with nearly 100 transinguinal preperitoneal mesh prosthesis ( tipp ) repairs for recurrent inguinal hernia the indication , anesthesia , modification of the technique , and results are reported .    2.276630469170759
after intraoperative classification of the hernia , the tipp repair is indicated especially in large defects of the posterior wall ( l / m iii ) .    2.4837899077643426
the procedure is easily performed under local anesthesia .    2.6680773094361587
during 52 local tipp repairs , conversion of anesthesia was never necessary .    2.102622574017712
important technical details include the requirement for a sufficient size of mesh ( 10 cm x 15 cm ) and a certain caudal and cranial fixation of the prosthesis using at least three interrupted UNK for each .    2.2396893740752346
apart from an increased number of UNK ( 12 % ) in the early postoperative period , the results of the tipp are comparable with those obtained after shouldice repair for recurrent hernia .    3.1365979806708433
the rate of hematomas , infections , and testicular complications range between 1 % and 3 % .    2.4406471930695983
considering the negative case selection of only large recurrent hernias , the tipp repair reveals a favourably low 1 - year recurrence rate of 1 % .    2.231661138340827
if representatives of the law suspect anyone of drug UNK by internal bodily UNK and refers the person to hospital , the doctor is requested to recover the ingested drug UNK by induction of emesis with UNK of UNK or UNK a .    2.5226591363659314
the permission of this induction as a coercive measure is controversial .    2.1514024119227853
the UNK , the public UNK or the judge has to decide , whether the induction of emesis is really necessary , the physician has to UNK the risks .    2.8845503840766833
especially when there are only a few drug - containers and the person is no UNK " body - UNK " , non - invasive diagnostic ways also can lead the evidence of incorporated drugs .    2.7082860681612386
rupture of the drug containers leads to acute intoxication and the physician must regard the person as his patient , he has to refuse the role as medical expert for the representatives of law .    2.180915079490526
the deformity in severe spondylolisthesis consists of two components : the parallel anterocaudad slip of the UNK UNK , and its tilt into kyphotic malposition .    2.6823332609860073
the influence of the two components is very different : the anterocaudad slippage has not much impact on the sagittal profile of the spine and is easily compensated for by a slight increase in lumbar UNK .    2.4509222844933567
the kyphotic deformity has a high impact on trunk imbalance and the sagittal profile .    2.2780312360554524
there are two compensation mechanisms : UNK of the lumbar spine to its anatomical UNK and - if that is not sufficient - UNK of the sacral bone , performed by contracture of the hamstrings and UNK of the pelvis around the hip joints .    2.7838128095570744
the latter mechanism is followed by functional disadvantages .    2.6617123731903845
therefore , correction of the kyphosis of l5 may be considered during operative treatment if the lumbosacral kyphosis ( angle delta ) is less than 85 ° and the sacral inclination less than 35 ° .    2.014894133976476
the diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities includes analysis of the geometry of the whole leg .    2.871195884117484
the first step in the diagnostic process is a standardized physical examination .    2.6446776625545514
it provides valuable background information for an effective radiological diagnosis .    2.448079575325874
even with a thorough standardized physical examination it is not possible to define exactly the deformity or decide on an operative procedure .    2.44637613238223
the diagnosis of axis deviations in the frontal plane can be measured on a conventional plain x - ray of the whole leg .    2.6285613566696187
in this view it is very important that the knee joints are in a true a . p . view independent on torsional deformities of the lower legs .    2.3811857207595155
today the gold standard to measure the torsion and length of the lower extremities is the ct scan .    2.7175106177597352
however , the multitude of analytical methods for ct measurements described in the literature do not lend themselves readily to comparison ; thus , it is difficult to identify a clear method of choice .    2.3993052268779618
not every ct measurement is better than a physical examination .    2.4399406309057405
evidence of reproducibility and accuracy is a prerequisite for useful interpretation of the results .    2.7052379434819827
up to this point in the literature there are only reference values for the ulm ct method .    2.8883483982132696
one alternative is the mr scan , which avoids radiological risks , but the reproducibility and accuracy of the mri method are not as good as for the ct method .    2.3485987733672116
another alternative is ultrasound , where recent advances in the measurement of torsion and length of the lower extremities have proven competitive with or superior to the accuracy of mri .    2.6178777828380175
the three - dimensional determination of the torsion and length of the lower extremities by ultrasound has now assumed a leading role in the non - radiological diagnosis of malalignments of the lower extremities in children and adolescents .    2.8184274468513513
this method furthermore is increasingly being used in preoperative planning of leg deformities in adults .    2.3176392326704356
purpose : management of organ - confined rcc is primarily surgical .    2.152278076491101
5 - year survival rates of all stages improved from 40 % in the UNK to 50 % in the UNK , and UNK at 60 % in recent series .    4.298838088369223
paramount use of ultrasound in modern medicine has been claimed to contribute significantly to an earlier detection of rcc thus better amenable for radical operation .    1.9645575827573354
other factors may have been strategies and general hospital care .    2.4021992111499992
however , it remains unclear whether an extended lymph node dissection as suggested UNK UNK in a UNK paper in the UNK bears any therapeutic value .    3.001879065970762
selected patients with minor lower limb injuries and low risk for deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) , who required cast immobilizing and did not receive medical thrombosis prophylaxis , were included in a prospective study .    2.4062641334347172
the decision to give not medical thrombosis prophylaxis depended on an concept of individualised prophylaxis for patients at risk for thromboembolism .    2.2062228695333572
from march 1994 to march 1996 in 178 outpatients ( 118 men , 60 women , mean age 25 , 8 [ 16 - 39 ] years ) a clinical examination and a colour - coded duplex sonography were performed after UNK of the cast for detection of dvt of the lower limb .    2.296459105098881
a UNK was performed when thrombosis was suspected .    2.7246743880808664
two patients developed a one bundle thrombosis of the calf .    2.707304428213836
clinical appearance of lung embolism was not observed .    2.6229016042190407
these results suggest , that low risk patients with minor injuries of the lower limb and plaster cast immobilisation do not need a medical thrombosis prophylaxis .    2.5525976316548635
for the judgment of the quality of medical services and for the progress of clinical medicine the comparison of data and informations of the diagnostic and therapeutic process is demanded .    2.887466560979421
therefore a systematic and concrete system of documentation should be implemented in every clinic , which consists of standard nomenclature , classification , instruments of outcome measure and documentation standards .    2.0035399822053064
there are a group of problems and UNK which stand in the way of this goal .    2.728487533652771
it is useful to build a minimum basis data set which includes core criterias of clinical UNK in orthopedic surgery and include this in an information system so that all of these parts are considered and that a central and comparable data pool is offered for patient care , quality management and research .    1.9838050551536468
basal cell adenocarcinoma was first introduced as an entity in the second edition of the who ' s " histologic typing of salivary gland tumours " in 1991 .    2.3571210492042973
this tumor was first described in 1990 by UNK and UNK from the UNK forces institute of pathology ( UNK ) .    3.036033705063996
basal cell adenocarcinoma accounts for about 2 . 9 % of all salivary gland malignancies .    3.073673283597852
more than 90 % of the tumors are situated in the parotid gland .    3.20552197250473
intraoral manifestations are known from case reports only .    2.458832925288911
tumors of the palate have been mentioned in three cases .    3.0270292875839373
histologically this tumor can be easily confused with basal cell adenoma and the solid basaloid subtype of adenoid cystic carcinoma .    2.1034553230734816
the case presented here is a middle - aged white woman with a basal cell adenocarcinoma of the palate .    2.468882463655458
therapy consisted of surgical extirpation with three - dimensional safety margins and histologically proven clear resection margins .    2.3099022767947357
knowledge at this point indicates that basal cell adenocarcinoma has a rather high probability of local recurrence ( up to 50 % ) and a mostly UNK metastatic potential for as long as 10 years after removal of the primary tumor .    2.790755186746985
ten year survival is around 75 % .    2.485900996506568
purpose : to study the incidence and shape of subclinical keratoconus with corneal topography in the UNK eye in the case of clinically , slit - lamp UNK and UNK diagnosed unilateral disease .    2.7063375547296715
this is a result of persistent risk factors and aging of the population .    2.969530377478908
medical progress with application of conservative , surgical or interventional strategies indeed reduced the morbidity and mortality of arteriosclerotic diseases , but markedly increased the medical care costs .    2.160065173491649
the result is a discussion about the optimal use of the different therapeutic measures under consideration of the evidence based medicine .    2.7241289394123447
the ileal conduit is a simple and safe supravesical urinary diversion with few postoperative complications .    2.2695888908784925
in patients with liver disease with portal hypertension , however , the risk of recurrent , UNK conduit bleeding is increased .    3.160393955647664
while the diagnosis is simple , several therapeutic options are available .    2.692317605419766
in most cases the bleeding comes from UNK varices , that can be controlled with local sclerotherapy with 3 % UNK or ligation of the bleeding vessel .    2.317795125497568
the resection of the part of the conduit carrying the varices is an option if bleeding is life threatening or the source cannot be localised .    2.3636957123700983
if bleeding recurs excision of the conduit should be considered .    2.7346601882024886
malignant disease must be excluded as a bleeding source .    2.5859028704717377
objectives : the UNK properties of bupivacain have been well documented under in - vitro , as well as under in - UNK conditions .    2.7716668766019668
a further mechanism of cardiovascular impairment by bupivacaine via the central nervous system gained investigational interest in animal studies .    2.2457878283870345
the aim of our study was to demonstrate the effect of a UNK perfusion of bupivacain on systemic hemodynamic UNK and their UNK by wash - out with UNK - csf .    2.7848769505832975
in recent years , our knowledge concerning pathophysiological changes in brain metabolism after traumatic brain injury ( tbi ) has greatly expanded .    2.122009146984532
this , in turn , has enabled the development of specific pharmacological strategies for the supplementary treatment of brain - injured patients with the aim of reducing secondary brain damage .    2.5503971794191767
the present article focuses on the pathophysiology of tbi and the possibilities for pharmacological intervention .    2.5414291635721065
while some of the substances reviewed are presently used in the treatment of tbi , others are under experimental and clinical evaluation at different stages .    2.670719672111499
this study explored characteristic subjective experiences of schizophrenia .    2.2880289294261473
a questionnaire for self - assessment of disturbances in several cognitive and perceptual areas ( the UNK schizophrenia inventory , or UNK ) was constructed and administered to first - episode schizophrenics ( sche , n = 45 ) , negative syndrome schizophrenics ( schn , n = 45 ) , UNK schizophrenics ( UNK , n = 24 ) , depressives ( dep , n = 43 ) , alcoholics ( alk , n = 48 ) , obsessive - compulsive patients ( zwa , n = 46 ) , and healthy controls ( UNK , n = 57 ) .    2.4547618016677184
comparisons between the sche , schn , dep , alk , and zwa groups and a subsequent factor analysis revealed four schizophrenia - specific dimensions : attention and speech impairment ( as ) , ideas of reference ( ir ) , auditory uncertainty ( au ) , and deviant perception ( dp ) .    1.8623658507543228
the results may contribute to refinements in the measurement of specific UNK signs , thus facilitating the development of early intervention approaches .    2.648236052713259
introduction : the conservative treatment of the most severe cases of keratoconjunctivitis sicca ( UNK ) can be sometimes UNK .    3.6053314870388715
especially with an underlying UNK disorder , even the application of artificial tears as often as every 5 min may not prevent further damage to the ocular surface .    2.402540978563327
a microvascular transplantation of the autologous submandibular gland ( sg ) can be performed by a maxillo - facial surgeon as an alternative approach for those cases .    2.4715337892138294
we report 2 years of ophthalmological experience with the results of this procedure .    3.13597384516256
aims : the predominant cause of death due to oral cancer is the failure to control local tumor due to regional tumor recurrence .    2.3796978763136267
the sequelae of surgical resection and high - dose irradiation cause substantial changes in head and neck anatomy , leading to considerable problems in the early morphological detection of recurrent disease .    2.932176792517599
therefore , this study evaluates the verification of cancer recurrence by means of its pathologic glucose metabolism .    2.6298021794125903
materials and methods : we reviewed a total of 50 [ 18f ] - 2 - fluordeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ( 18fdg - pet ) investigations performed in 44 patients who had undergone surgical resection of oral cancer .    2.476412916559565
in 23 cases , re - staging ( group a ) was indicated due to suspicion of recurrent or secondary tumor manifestation .    2.238490925026225
statistic evaluation included sensitivity , specifity , positive / negative predictive value and accuracy of 18fdg - pet for the detection of tumor manifestation .    2.3739409123360597
results : 18fdg - pet correctly identified 23 of 26 tumor sites ( 88 % ) in the re - staging group and 9 of 10 tumor sites ( 90 % ) in the screening group .    2.6649428455586595
we encountered a total number of 16 false - positive foci with an increased 18fdg - uptake .    2.590952471436547
in six patients , 18fdg - pet detected tumor recurrence several months before a morphological UNK could be identified .    2.5109083069355935
in 5 of these 6 patients , the pet findings for the latter tumor sites determined the patient ' s fate .    2.6453575442036095
specificity was 63 % for local recurrence , 97 % for secondary lymph node involvement and 90 % for distant metastasis .    2.3934161836851118
conclusion : according to these data , 18fdg - pet is the most effective diagnostic tool in the follow - up of oral cancer patients to date .    2.9441498752329216
due to the high prevalence of recurrent disease in the follow - up of oral cancer , either the detection of early recurrence or the identification of additional , incurable tumors may add substantially to a rational therapeutic management .    2.604982421890012
we therefore recommend 18fdg - pet for screening and re - staging of recurrent oral cancer .    2.2043906077092217
in over 80 % of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease , the nissen antireflux fundoplication gives good long - term results .    2.849691129958822
dysphagia , inability to UNK or UNK as well as the gas UNK syndrome are possible sequelae after fundoplication .    3.135956719361247
the frequency of these symptoms could be reduced by modification of the original nissen - rossetti fundoplication into the so - called " floppy " nissen fundoplication , a short and loose wrap of mobilized gastric fundus .    2.3339048470860697
failures of the antireflux procedure are mainly due to disruption or displacement of the wrap with the telescope phenomenon .    2.214196740967782
here , reoperation with UNK of the original wrap may lead to same functional results like a primary fundoplication .    2.882549537011009
technical alternatives may selectively be chosen , when gastroesophageal reflux disease is complicated by fixated UNK hernia , esophageal shortening , or serious esophageal motility disorders .    1.9973498505891012
such specific anatomic or functional abnormalities are detected by preoperative endoscopy , barium swallow , 24 - h ph monitoring , and manometry .    2.0558921757049307
alternative techniques are mainly transthoracic repairs , including the nissen fundoplication , UNK gastroplasty , and the UNK mark iv .    2.825009240469915
modifications of the 360 ° nissen operation are partial UNK like the hill repair and the toupet dorsal fundoplication .    2.0180377222616324
because of a high failure rate in the long - term follow - up , application of the ligamentum UNK UNK and of the UNK prosthesis is not recommended .    4.094015179535956
we report a sporadic case of giant axonal neuropathy ( gan ) starting in a 5 - year - old boy with gait disturbance .    2.1832726744344044
at the age of 10 years he showed signs of a sensomotoric polyneuropathy and central neurological symptoms : intention tremor , nystagmus and visual disturbance .    2.1963979314101283
sural nerve biopsy showed many giant axons with accumulation of UNK , which were also found in cytoplasma of schwann cells , endothelial cells and fibrocytes .    2.4521877472443716
similar changes were detected in endothelial cells of a muscle biopsy , which additionally displayed neurogenic atrophy and target fibers .    2.174690833918783
immunohistochemically , desmin , vimentin , heat shock protein 70 , and UNK were not detectable in giant axons , which , however , contained UNK protein 68 , 200 and - tubulin .    2.5273440332351176
our case shows that careful ultrastructural examination of a muscle biopsy may point to the diagnosis of gan .    2.707088604070656
the endoscopic release of the carpal ligament gives the opportunity to treat the carpal tunnel syndrome in a comfortable and minimal invasive way .    2.137106205240052
between 1 october 1994 and 7 may 1995 , 46 patients who underwent endoscopic surgery on 55 hands were documented in a prospective study .    2.4207678509967763
the following results were taken from a questionnaire .    2.664447204129234
there were not any complaints , or the complaints were so much diminished that complete division of the carpal ligament could be viewed as accomplished in 51 of 55 cases .    2.097203944199702
there were continuing complaints in four cases , and after an additional check two patients were operated on again .    3.012716745550429
the advantage of the endoscopic method is the inconspicuous scar and the reduced postoperative UNK .    2.3992748492768654
for surgical removal of a malignant choroid melanoma , it is necessary to reduce systolic blood pressure to around 50 - 60 mmhg in order to prevent choroidal haemorrhages .    2.97027956214629
however , blood pressure reduction is associated with the risk of cerebral ischaemia .    3.62234042884364
the oesophageal temperature had dropped by 0 . 3 ° c at this time .    2.607029942391883
the 2 - channel electroencephalogram ( eeg ) showed no irregularities during this time period .    2.3485341556745327
a bilateral , reversible , apparently blood - pressure - dependent loss of waves i and ii during arterial hypotension despite a normal eeg has to our knowledge not been previously described in the literature .    2.142471494525702
the isolated loss of waves i and ii with maintenance of waves iii , iv , and v is unusual .    2.1581595839194634
the literature contains reports of acoustic UNK patients in whom only wave v could be recorded .    2.263138609652732
others have observed a patient with temporary and reversible loss of baep wave i due to vasospasm of the internal auditory artery that apparently occurred during or shortly after manipulation of the internal auditory meatus .    2.1385617822936736
assuming anatomic peculiarities in the blood supply to the generators of the baep waves , a stenosis of the basilar artery could be considered as the cause of the bilateral reversible loss of waves i and ii .    2.321343093536004
another potential source could be the induced hypothermia , but this does not seem very likely because the patient ' s temperature was 0 . 3 ° c lower at the return of the waves than at their loss .    2.5371398118047925
in the syndrome arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy , little is known to date about the mechanism for the development of arrhythmias .    2.542992801452428
the analysis of the long - term electrocardiographic data includes the measurement of rr - intervals 30 , 15 , 5 , UNK and immediately before onset of the vt , the determination of the morphology of the previous ventricular premature beats , and the frequency of the atrial arrhythmias .    3.131126260316146
normal values for the analysis of late potentials in the ecg signal UNK with bidirectional filters between 40 and UNK were defined a maximum of UNK for a qrs width , las of 38ms , and UNK of UNK .    2.8329805832098605
the analysis of the long - term ecg produced monomorphic vt in all cases without previous atrial arrhythmia and in only 4 cases with previous polymorphic ventricular premature beats .    2.4964342476647015
a long - short phenomenon could only be proven in UNK episodes .    2.7260826313111393
in 84 % of all tachycardias , no arrhythmia were found immediately before onset of the arrhythmic event .    2.6215479105036676
according to the circadian clock , two peaks , mornings between 6 and 9h and evenings between 6 and 9h , could be determined .    2.1214362652492045
in patients , who were recently diagnosed with arvd , a significant shortening of the rr intervals before the onset of vt as an indication of an acceleration of the sinus rhythm was observed .    2.537359990176248
this effect could not be observed in patients with a past medical history of avrd .    3.653963681254476
late potentials were determined with a prevalence of 74 % overall .    2.630890199305632
increasingly , late potentials were observed with morphologically diffuse forms of the arvd .    2.5403666912839644
a correlation to the severity of spontaneous arrhythmias ( ventricular , sustained or not sustained vt ) could not be established .    2.5075538894120912
in comparison to the origin of vt in coronary heart disease , previous arrhythmias play a less important role in UNK right ventricular dysplasia cardiomyopathy .    2.539387590020001
most importantly , an intensified sympathetic tone before onset of vt and an increased prevalence of positive late potentials are observed .    2.225177972840764
we present the case of a 54 - year - old male patient with a UNK amputation of his left leg following diabetic gangrene of the foot .    2.3845549922468643
a local infection of the stump was treated successfully with two endoscopic debridements and lavage .    2.5380942653843452
additionally , the patient received local antibiotics by the application of antibiotic collagenous fleece and antibiotic chains .    2.627541945277872
this therapeutic management combined with early weight bearing led to a stable stump .    2.5360813327943954
we describe an eighteen - months - old boy , who suffered from congenital UNK UNK , UNK , microcephaly , facial UNK and psychomotor retardation in connection with a partial monosomy of the short arm of chromosome 8 .    2.5125195571134693
in most cases the genesis of brachial plexus palsy is traumatic , often because of bike accidents .    2.202638732385044
if physiotherapy and neurosurgical procedures such as nerve repair do not have the desired outcome , muscle transfer operations are possible .    2.278496163454914
preoperatively radiological , clinical and UNK examinations are necessary .    2.824343107018101
our results are based upon the clinical and radiological check ups and the subjective assessment of the patients .    3.121653270755939
thirty - one patients ( 7 female , 24 male ) underwent a trapezius transfer between march 1994 and december 1996 .    2.1967955433272626
the average age was 29 years ( range 18 - 46 years ) .    2.4374855655962246
we performed the operations using a modification of UNK ' s technique .    2.7071402898884247
with the patient in lateral decubitus position and protection of the opposite plexus , a UNK skin incision is the first step , followed by the preparation of trapezius and deltoid muscle as well as the bony parts of the shoulder ( acromion , clavicle , scapular spine ) .    2.8168393274871395
the deltoid origin is cut from the lateral third of the clavicle , the acromion and the lateral half of the scapular spine .    2.4457247431569864
the next step is transection of the root of the acromion and the lateral clavicle .    2.3936693027042204
after elevation of the remaining trapezius UNK from the clavicle and scapular spine , the proximal humerus is UNK by splitting the partly UNK deltoid muscle longitudinally .    2.3658299732836747
then the acromion fragment and humerus are prepared for the bone - to - bone contact .    2.599230675252084
in 90 ° of abduction the acromion fragment with its trapezius insertion is transferred and fixed to the humerus with two 4 . 5 - mm screws .    2.2561565061838076
finally the deltoid is sutured on the top of the trapezius and the skin is closed over two suction drains .    2.112647463906679
postoperatively we UNK the operated arm in an abduction support for 6 weeks .    2.3842304331354773
the physiotherapy program starts on the first postoperative day with active training of elbow , hand and fingers and electrostimulation of the transferred trapezius muscle .    2.095938142076845
six weeks after the procedure we take an x - ray and start with progressive adduction of the arm .    2.5881402299132046
the preoperative subluxation of the humeral head was abolished in all cases .    2.5398199355293016
we achieved an average increase of active abduction from 7 . 3 ° ( range 0 - 45 ° ) preoperatively to 39 . 2 ° ( range 25 ° - 80 ° ) 1 year after the operation ; the increase of forward flexion was from 20 ° ( range 0 ° - 85 ° ) to 43 ° ( range 20 ° - 90 ° ) .    2.268194148424516
all patients were satisfied with the improvement of stability and function of the operated shoulder .    3.014350641494989
finally we can conclude that the trapezius transfer for UNK shoulder gives a satisfactory outcome regarding shoulder function and stability as well as the subjective situation of the patients .    2.4381900072276443
we analyzed psychiatric and UNK data from 103 arsonists .    2.3390135204287823
the following criticisms of the definition of pyromania according to dsm - iii - r and idc - 10 seem appropriate .    2.1925346131014782
first , the categoric exclusion of aggressive motives does not seem very promising , since approximately one fourth of arsonists whose firesetting is based on motives UNK in dsm - iii - r may also have an aggressive motive .    2.0507437443667897
second , icd - 10 gives being UNK and alcoholism as a criterion for the exclusion of pyromania .    2.377251369017967
this seems UNK , since the behavior classed as pyromania is largely a product of alcohol UNK .    2.184538676706424
repeated firesetting , resulting from being UNK by fire etc . , may be less a disturbance of impulse control but rather the manifestation of a UNK , which , supported by alcohol abuse , extends into older age .    2.556637416085814
the mean age of such arsonists is slightly above 20 years .    2.3115486520038466
the tendency for relapses after UNK seems to be low ; this tendency probably decreases spontaneously in older age .    2.255714456944751
the mean age of arsonists with aggressive motives is a little below 30 years , those setting fire with suicidal motives have a mean age of 35 , UNK arsonists have a mean age of 40 years .    2.171139116067806
concrete sexual motives are relatively rare .    2.613664633456285
approximately 50 % of arsonists have a purely aggressive motive .    2.8070479165041475
UNK is a rare cause , however , since most of them do not even know the victims .    3.148118631108927
one third of these persons set the fire in their own homes .    2.2392926299532463
most arsonists show a personality disorder , with insecurity and narcissism UNK .    2.167142475130553
data on firesetting are to be treated with caution , since two thirds of all cases are newer resolved ; one fourth of cases concern minors , and in central europe arsonists with rational motives are hardly ever referred to psychiatrists .    2.348563766121358
a normal ciliary beat frequency of UNK cells is necessary for the UNK clearance of the nose and paranasal sinuses .    2.732849247803695
an in vitro investigation was performed to UNK - UNK the influence of topical corticosteroids and antihistamines on the ciliary beat frequency of human nasal mucosa .    3.0285926108267383
the nasal sprays examined contained the corticosteroids budesonide or UNK UNK and the topical antihistamines UNK or UNK .    2.8274001106974573
all tests were performed on cell cultures of human nasal mucosa during constant conditions .    2.3880307747451854
three of the four nasal sprays tested contained benzalkonium chloride as preservative .    2.195529235915779
an irreversible cessation of ciliary movement was observed in all cells exposed to nasal sprays containing benzalkonium chloride in a 50 per cent solution .    2.215176264793001
the nasal spray containing budesonide was benzalkonium chloride - free and caused minor but fully reversible decreases in ciliary beat frequency after 20 min .    1.9442144532067938
as benzalkonium chloride can cause complete standstill of ciliary beat frequency in vitro in human nasal mucosa , we recommend that this preservative should not be used anymore in topical nasal medications .    2.148542860336702
the treatment of patients with severe burn injuries is expensive and belongs in the hands of specialized burn centres .    2.459915177373102
in our burn centre 257 patients were treated from 1991 to june 1995 ( between 50 and 60 patients per year except for 1993 with 77 patients ) .    2.1574626472745604
patients were evaluated according to the absi score ( mean 7 ) and had mortality of around 15 % .    2.5849295066422218
the costs range between 3 . 7 and 4 . 8 million dm per year , the profit lies in the same range .    3.0464490378689413
the costs are divided into staff costs ( 1 . 4 - 1 . 8 million dm per year ) , costs for medical treatment ( 1 . 5 - 1 . 9 million dm per year ) and costs for internal services ( 600 000 - 900 000 dm per year ) such as laboratory examinations ( 247 000 - UNK 000 dm per year ) and blood bank ( 100 000 - 215 000 dm per year ) , the main factors in this category .    2.4367364250417163
the different fields of costs and profit are compared in this analysis .    2.3346184266478933
possible ways of reducing costs are pointed out , and the question of effectiveness of therapy is discussed .    3.162871008917559
conclusions from this analysis are limited by the individuality of each case with different clinical courses , the great number of influencing factors and the comparably small numbers of patients .    2.2797251598482
in benign UNK stenosis the amount of respiratory deterioration rather than the crude morphologic appearance will determine whether or not surgical measures such as dilatation or resection should be applied .    2.293486457216056
this review focusses on currently available and newly developed diagnostic tools to assess the functional importance of central airway obstruction .    2.260587551575142
after an outline of upper airway physiology is formulated , UNK measurements at rest are collected .    2.192258375402916
among these , peak expiratory flow rate ( UNK ) proved to be the UNK and most reliable parameter to monitor an obstructing lesion of the upper airways .    3.1944412174558097
a novel technique for UNK assessment of glottic and tracheal resistance is presented in detail .    2.230700103089782
in contrast to usual tests of total airflow resistance which cannot distinguish between central and peripheral contributions , this test identifies the pressure - flow - relationship created exclusively by the local lesion .    1.8656707234666927
in serial stenoses , it indicates which is of higher clinical impact .    2.2713406998971353
patients with upper airway obstruction complain of impaired exercise capacity .    2.361788044734799
they tend to UNK with imminent respiratory muscle fatigue .    2.9152183727160916
therefore , UNK may play a role in defining the point of incomplete compensation of a central load .    2.490404175901451
the decision to operate will depend upon up the degree of physical capacity required to compensate for the stenosis .    2.34642223990563
stroke units are hospital - based special wards aiming at optimal care by a specialized team with an integrated concept for patients with acute UNK .    2.3975799885863216
following the initial UNK - UNK and neuroradiological evaluation , early treatment will be initiated based on the assumed pathophysiology of the stroke .    2.899257247417116
acute management includes monitoring of physiological , parameters , care by specialized nurses , and early implementation of physiotherapists , speech therapy and occupational therapy .    1.9670370784449513
despite the increased initial costs , the long - term burden for the health system is decreased by shorter hospital stay and reduced morbidity and disability .    2.4516124261804
heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) is the most important side - effect of heparin therapy .    2.9044183146308695
two types of thrombocytopenia can be caused by heparin : a frequent non - immunologic type causing a minor decrease in thrombocyte count without apparent clinical importance and , on the other hand , an immunologic type accompanied by thromboembolic complications .    2.028302417848619
patients and methods : we report on two cases with hit type ii after coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) .    2.58943561805415
hit antibodies were demonstrated by elisa for platelet - factor - 4 - heparin - complex and heparin - induced platelet - activation ( UNK ) assay .    2.4394378085496164
results : a 67 year old patient suffered from a hit type ii seven days after administration of heparin during myocardial revascularization .    2.4814035927555036
in this patient , a continuous fever and a signicantly reduced general condition were the primary symptoms .    2.390346552322853
the clinical picture of this disease was reversible after aborting the heparin therapy .    2.4842765386491497
a 70 year old patient developed a hit type ii with thromboembolic complications 13 days after cabg .    2.708659562941922
the vascular occlusions affected the a . spinalis anterior with the development of a spinalis anterior - syndrome , the coronary arteries with the development of UNK infarction , and the a . UNK UNK .    3.035430318942907
a white - UNK syndrome with thrombi in the ascending aorta , in the left atrium , and in the left ventricle required an operation with extracorporal circulation including the use of recombinant hirudin for anticoagulation .    3.1971639951612123
conclusion : with therapy with heparin , it is obligatory to check platelet count .    2.567509375269766
an indication for the development of hit type ii is a decrease in platelet count or thromboembolic complications during heparin therapy .    2.9286676355285106
in the case of hit type ii recombinant hirudin was a practical UNK as an anticoagulant for extracorporal circulation and for continous hemofiltration .    2.13239788071984
oxygen radicals and oxygen radial mediators are thought to be important components in the development of acute lung injury , sepsis , and multiple organ failure .    2.790839592015555
n - UNK ( nac ) has been used as an antioxidant in a wide variety of experiments .    3.165647103492605
nac has been suggested to act by raising concentrations of cysteine , and hence glutathione , and by scavenging of oxidant species [ 1 , 11 , 17 , 29 ] .    2.168747010375451
the present study was designed to investigate whether the application of nac in intubated patients has an effect on concentrations of reduced glutathione in plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid ( UNK ) and on the lipid peroxidation products UNK and conjugated UNK .    2.4330094192495113
because nac has been widely used as a UNK drug for the treatment of lung diseases , the influence on UNK mucus was studied , too .    3.1287649959747283
between 1990 and 1995 , 27 patients with posttraumatic disorders of the subtalar joint were treated by correcting fusion .    2.9388172882147265
preoperatively 24 patients ( 88 . 89 % ) suffered from pain ; 15 ( 55 . 56 % ) had a walking range below 100 m . seven patients were unable to work in their original profession .    2.4052401537294337
after an average period of 13 . 85 months postoperatively the patients were examined again .    2.892020791532948
according to the score of UNK and UNK , in 81 . 48 % of patients the result of the correcting arthrodesis was successful ; according to kitaoka ' s clinical rating system for ankle - hindfoot , midfoot , hallux and lesser toes , the average postoperative score was 75 . 8 points .    2.5164775050927957
objective : to examine changes in body mass index ( bmi ) in children in the last twenty years and to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity .    2.694009862555852
the review of medication has been recommended as an important part in preventing falls .    2.6577792575572454
in a random sample of 276 hospital in - patients aged 75 and over , the frequency of prescribed drugs which may increase the risk of falling by causing dizziness was assessed .    2.2491493982018747
questions about dizziness and previous falls were included in a standardized questionnaire .    2.455626946946017
migration of an impacted mandibular premolar is a rare finding , whereas UNK of lower jaw UNK is described much more often in the literature .    2.5166245649209844
we present a patient in whom radiographic studies show the migration of a mandibular premolar to the muscular process over a period of 14 years .    2.224419607332741
most of the tooth migration along the vertical portion of the mandibula into the UNK muscularis took place after the root development had ended .    2.1608212949028527
neither radiological nor clinical examination revealed the stimulus which changed the path and the direction of the impacted tooth .    2.2484946801730152
in atopic eczema patients the well - known abnormal cutaneous reactivity of the blood vessels ( white UNK , delayed UNK after acetylcholine , paradoxical UNK after nicotinic acid application and diminished erythema after histamine injection ) were observed during acute eczematous episodes and later in an eczema - free state in comparison with controls .    2.03521833388343
in this follow - up study the use of different stimuli allowed us to demonstrate abnormal cutaneous vascular reactions in the patients depending on the severity of their atopic eczema .    2.9156237207386333
severely affected patients showed persistence of the paradoxical vascular reactions even in an eczema - free cutaneous state .    2.0882080222000523
we report on a 9 - year - old girl with a giant cell UNK of the right anterior chest wall .    2.961096000223326
the typical clinical presentation is a solitary , usually 2 - 6 cm large , non - tender mass of blue - greyish colour which is mostly located on the back , anterior chest wall , thigh or groin .    2.2237637467931637
the histology shows a loose infiltrate of predominantly bland spindle cells in dermis and subcutis .    2.054672942935888
characteristic elements of the tumour are large UNK branching spaces lacking any UNK - or epithelium , and relatively small multinucleated cells ( UNK cells ) .    2.0694536397258108
the recurrence rate is high if the tumour is not excised with adequate safety margins .    2.1521519606229904
it is of pre - eminent importance to differentiate this rare benign tumor from sarcomas , in order to avoid an inappropriately aggressive therapy .    2.536322073830663
to correct severe septal deformities , it is often necessary to perform an extracorporal septoplasty with temporary removal of the deviated septal cartilage , followed by straightening and reimplantation into the nose as free graft .    2.3970986079191863
the utilization of a compound graft , which sutures the cartilage fragments to a resorbable polydioxanon ( pds ) foil , facilitates this technique immediately while simultaneously ensuring support of the nasal dorsum .    2.0005685384717866
stress incontinence is the most frequent form of incontinence found in females .    2.872990582457966
the usual method of surgery for this is to lift the bladder neck towards cranial and ventral .    2.294906515270091
two competitive techniques - bladder neck suspension in accordance with stamey and colposuspension in accordance with burch - were retrospectively investigated .    2.208135096118607
a total of 95 women underwent surgery and it was possible to evaluate the postoperative course in 46 and 30 ( total 76 ) patients respectively .    2.4624881370961536
initially , both surgical techniques demonstrated a very good success rate ( 91 . 3 % and 96 . 7 % resp . ) .    2.670301074518564
however , the continence rate of the stamey patients deteriorated after 6 weeks down to 78 . 3 % and after more than 2 years only 28 . 6 % of these patients were still completely continent ( mean follow - up 40 . 4 mths ) , whereas deterioration in the burch patients was only 87 % ( mean follow - up 44 . 25 mths ) .    2.611304750776724
the disappointing results with the stamey technique did not correlate with the degree of initial continence .    2.5728857253765254
it was noted here that obese patients showed a greater tendency towards regression .    2.4331842552586678
the three cases of recurring incontinence after burch colposuspension were already relapses at the time of surgery .    2.5449391813705766
with respect to long - term follow - up , our results with the stamey method were distinctly poorer than with the burch technique .    2.765093012972768
therefore , in our opinion , the burch colposuspension procedure and UNK should be the method of choice for the management of stress incontinence .    3.0747892345542813
this paper is concerned with the relationship between social inequality and psychiatric disorders , an issue being neglected in german psychiatry for a long time .    2.201476129457494
social inequality will be discussed in it ' s dimensions " socioeconomic status " and " sex " referring to the present state of epidemiological and sociological knowledge .    2.3458318397236884
because such UNK factors offer little explanation for the association with psychiatric disorders by themselves UNK concepts of burden and resources are necessary to link the structural and the individual level .    2.200651237643144
these concepts are considered to be one pathway by which the mechanisms to disease may occur .    2.5689095610378074
a short review of empirical findings and analytic approaches show the complexity of these mechanisms UNK further research not only because of analytic deficiences but also because of social change .    1.9961375522557758
further research will concern in general the explanation of social patterns of diseases , in detail the link between individual stress and coping with the social structure , and last but not least a gender - sensitive approach to psychiatric disorders which is more UNK .    2.0363940192485233
it is well known that alterations to the oral cavity caused by dental prostheses may affect speech articulation , although influences on the voice are not assumed .    2.1742498146413998
in addition to the vocal fundamental frequency , vibrations of the vocal UNK generate overtones .    2.2489788870101575
through the shape of the larynx and the upper airway , resonances and UNK are formed , and in this way overtones are amplified to a variable extent .    2.828048429903491
UNK changes caused by a dental prosthesis in the oral cavity may possibly influence overtones but influences on the vocal fundamental frequency seem unlikely .    2.403708070464375
the influence of dental prostheses on the voice is demonstrated in a patient who UNK two different dental prostheses .    2.832225467830746
the fundamental frequency rose by up to five semitones during speech and his vocal range increased by up to four semitones when a thin denture was used instead of a normal denture .    1.9620730387490837
when the position of the mandible was checked by intraoral needle point placement , a more rostral position of the mandible was recorded with the thin denture than with the normal denture .    2.5001111802004314
sagittal magnetic resonance tomography imaging also showed that the larynx was in a more cranial position .    2.6482790426494787
this change was presumed to be due to an upward movement of the larynx induced by the tongue , which itself was found to be in a more cranial position with the thin denture .    2.757745384560554
in this situation , increased tension of the laryngeal muscles were believed to induce a rise in fundamental frequency , shifting the voice range toward higher frequencies .    2.101504647126375
these findings show that dental prostheses can cause vocal changes in individual cases .    2.2536962590004133
the etiology of this occurrence is still not clear .    2.6097905151437417
cytokine blood levels are found to be moderately elevated in chronic heart failure , as a function of severity of disease .    2.9041748063230397
the source of these cytokines and the trigger mechanisms stimulating cytokine release are a matter of intense research .    2.21254817961235
potential players include bacterial endotoxin from intestinal translocation , a neurohumoral UNK with an enhanced sympathetic tone or an UNK of UNK from the UNK heart itself .    2.6285489290640225
we present arguments in favor of a direct link between the chronically enhanced sympathetic tone in heart failure and the clinically over activation of the immune system , particularly interleukin 6 release .    2.3313246466727953
objectives : this 1998 survey was carried out on the use of the sitting position for neurosurgical procedures in the posterior fossa and operations of the UNK and cervical spine region by the dorsal approach .    2.7520412949534814
in addition , anesthetic management of the sitting position and the compliance with recommendations of the UNK study group of the german society of anesthesiology and intensive care medicine ( UNK ) published in 1995 were investigated and compared to results of a 1995 survey .    2.9280810018104986
polar body analysis is a UNK tool to exclude genetically altered oocytes prior to fertilisation .    2.3965741145394066
this helps to improve pregnancy rates and baby take home rates in assisted reproduction , primarily in advanced maternal age patients .    1.9370147700426459
this might reduce the need of invasive prenatal diagnosis for those patients .    2.769773259074117
polar body analysis offers treatment in reproductive medicine for female patients carrying a chromosomal UNK or a mutation before they become pregnant .    2.0254763902113515
however , it does not assess the genetic status of the embryo resulting from the UNK tested and selected .    2.720485012984481
the paternal contribution to the embryo is left UNK .    2.409818471725581
ethical considerations do not play a role , since no manipulation or selection is performed on embryos .    2.3119441804685628
pachydermoperiostosis ( UNK - erb - UNK syndrome , UNK - UNK - UNK syndrome ) is a rare disease with an autosomal dominant mode of UNK ; it occurs almost exclusively in men .    3.4089853730560717
a report of typical pachydermoperiostosis in a 31 - year - old man is presented .    2.461631877291052
associated features were UNK digits of the hands and feet with UNK - crystal nails , thickening of the skin and soft tissues , hyperhidrosis of hands and feet , hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands with UNK , UNK , and UNK abnormalities that had been present since puberty .    2.680473318381199
radiological examination revealed periosteal hyperostosis of the short and long bones .    2.4049434908019784
endocrine disturbances were not detected .    2.7393160480293437
skin biopsies showed hypertrophy of the skin and skin appendages .    2.864247817753098
primary ( idiopathic , hereditary ) pachydermoperiostosis should be distinguished from secondary ( symptomatic ) forms of the disease , which are often associated with lung tumours .    2.484642103070827
the following review will examine the outcome of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy treatment studies of anorexia and bulimia nervosa .    2.231199857296464
for both eating disorders , psychotherapy is the treatment of choice .    2.7736700090172772
in clinical practice " treatment UNK " are offered to account for the complexity of the disorders .    2.536098006584462
in bulimia nervosa , cognitive - behavioral therapy techniques have dominated the literature and appear to be successful .    2.4535819663924388
newer studies reporting on the use of interpersonal therapy also find considerable improvement of symptoms .    2.4070633562109167
UNK medication can be useful in the treatment of bulimia nervosa .    3.3690588319032386
recently , a UNK care approach to treatment has been recommended , with self - care UNK as the first step .    2.807310142481672
in anorexia nervosa there is a paucity of controlled clinical trials .    2.7003213925472807
UNK management for weight restoration can be viewed as a necessary element in all in - and outpatient treatments .    2.13864321894194
family therapy , cognitive - behavioral therapy , and psychodynamic approaches have proven useful in clinical practice ; however , only a limited data base exists regarding the efficacy of these therapies .    2.645332196360798
medication should not be used routinely in the treatment of anorexia nervosa .    3.338781675948572
absorption of irrigating fluid in transurethral prostatic resection ( turp ) and percutaneous UNK ( UNK ) into veins or delayed absorption due to fluid extravasation may result in a turp syndrome .    2.221311689779076
the measurement of end - tidal breath alcohol concentration ( et ac ) as a monitor of absorption of irrigating fluid labelled with 2 % ethanol is limited by the disturbance of infrared sensors by volatile anaesthetics and nitrous oxide ( n2o ) ( fig .    2.0784778231978827
an electrochemical sensor is acceptable for this method .    2.5314636976511027
the aim of the present study was the evaluation of breath alcohol measurements using an electrochemical sensor device ( UNK UNK , UNK ) .    2.717492910969945
the stability of the sensor in the presence of volatile anaesthetics was examined using a lung model .    2.6595125931595733
in a clinical investigation , the device was then applied to spontaneously breathing or mechanically ventilated patients UNK volatile anaesthetics during endoscopic urological surgery .    2.1497882843728906
skin diseases , the UNK and psychological changes are often UNK , especially in patients presenting for expert dermatologic opinion .    3.5775577912788172
in many cases an additional evaluation provided by psychotherapeutic medicine may be necessary .    2.2666625189814646
this resource may help with the diagnosis , explanation of the problem and estimation of the degree of disability .    2.920751803245587
the different legal guidelines of the various evaluation boards must be considered .    2.58392146592667
the role of psychotherapeutic evaluation is demonstrated through case examples .    2.31737083505941
the evaluation of new possibly occupationally - related disorders such as multiple chemical sensitivity and UNK is considered .    2.5160562045977524
we investigated the impact of old age on the antidepressant effect of sleep deprivation .    2.445945032488895
32 depressive inpatients were assessed before and after sleep deprivation by the UNK depression rating scale .    2.811098318140203
the patients were divided into two groups according to their age .    2.7488000259887957
the result showed no negative impact of old age on the anti - UNK effect of sleep deprivation .    2.5283426690844273
during mri - controlled resection of brain tumors using an open mri system , operation - induced alterations may occur , especially enhancement of the resection cavity wall .    2.169193665424525
this may simulate tumor areas , resulting in false assessment of the resection or resection of non - tumorous areas .    2.786942482883106
in our opinion , there is a superposition of preformed peritumoral reactions by operation - induced UNK .    2.514725359365755
the beginning of the cavity wall enhancement needs at least 10 - 15 min .    2.446332180793008
mri - controlled analysis of the intraoperative steps by the neurosurgeon and UNK allows discrimination of operation - induced reactions from tumor areas and leads to safe operation .    2.3839551801579546
angiosarcomas are very rare but highly malignant soft tissue tumors derived from the vascular endothelium .    2.7384029128778153
the tumor is most commonly found in the skin .    3.296941384613441
the cancer is known to cause early and widespread metastases leading to a very poor prognosis of less than 24 months .    2.6446895792893867
the therapy of choice is radical surgery followed by adjuvant radiation .    2.4275562616862816
despite the important role of lymph node infiltration for the classification and prognosis of non - small - cell lung cancer ( nsclc ) , no standards exist to evaluate the quality of mediastinal lymphadenectomy .    2.8765570006540475
UNK at several centers are not UNK that complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy is necessary .    2.4105013287203
we investigated UNK consecutive patients undergoing a potential curative operation for nsclc including complete ipsilateral lymph node dissection in order to ascertain whether or not there is a correlation between tumor localization and lymph node infiltration .    2.6600118897129743
patients were classified into the uicc ( 1987 ) stages i ( n = 115 ) , ii ( n = 42 ) , and iiia ( n = 113 ) .    2.879173736690619
in patients with n1 - positive lymph nodes ( n = 61 ) we found higher 5 - year survival for patients with only intrapulmonary lymph node infiltration ( 39 % ) than for patients with UNK infiltration ( 21 % ) .    2.979983145077627
patients with n2 disease showed skip metastases in up to 81 % of cases .    2.595809591338177
we found that no tumor location predicted the lymph node infiltration .    2.54023689372516
due to the variability of lymph node infiltration and the frequently occurring skip metastases , complete ipsilateral lymphadenectomy should be the standard for curative operations for nsclc .    2.377962823008446
the muscles should be viewed as a response member in functional and structural disorders as well as in central control .    2.584191718732607
purpose : the aim of the study was to apply laparoscopic techniques in reconstructive procedures for aortoiliac occlusive disease .    2.4089224201563897
methods : from february 1996 to february 1998 , 16 patients underwent a laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass procedure ( abf ) using the transperitoneal approach .    2.175135398910841
six , 5 to 12 mm UNK were needed to dissect , cross - clamp and divide the infrarenal aorta using specific laparoscopic devices .    1.9279307846045426
the aortic anastomosis was made end - to - side .    2.807710227661178
a long curved clamp was then passed from each groin to draw the limbs of the graft into the femoral incision .    2.156559554200894
the distal anastomosis was then performed conventionally .    2.494372964085038
results : the laparoscopic abf was performed successfully in 13 of 16 cases .    2.3493018707138726
three times a conversion to open surgery was requested .    2.6521625837255263
one patient developed respiratory insufficiency requiring prolonged treatment on the icu .    2.361125280915539
mean operative time was 292 + / - 60 min ; the aorta was UNK for 74 + / - 18 min .    2.8419462802647018
in the study group , blood loss averaged UNK + / - UNK ml .    2.729062911718535
the bypass patency and the correct positioning of the graft were assessed by angiography .    2.6321184555090724
the patients were discharged 9 + / - 5 . 8 days after surgery .    3.0164426360255576
all grafts were patent , and the ischemic symptoms had resolved in 14 patients .    2.670668362236815
one patient with recurrent claudication had severe stenosis of the left distal anastomosis .    2.8484351774252485
conclusions : the laparoscopic aortobifemoral bypass is a feasible , safe and effective procedure .    2.312637979072411
specific laparoscopic instruments are required for the challenging procedure .    2.5228097955789477
the development of vascular UNK and retraction devices will probably reduce the operative time and the technical challenge .    2.254511740523759
in the future this operative technique may gain relevance as a minimally invasive procedure for severe aortoiliac occlusive disease .    2.218455379618064
a 12 year old boy developed the complete symptom complex of UNK - UNK ' s disease over a two - year period .    3.310238692332532
he presented with the mucocutaneous variant with recurrent to persistent oral ulcers which extended into the pharynx , recurrent genital ulcers , perianal lesions , and a positive UNK test .    2.304531583226989
ocular involvement and other symptoms associated with the disease were absent .    2.908366114915107
however , the early onset of the disease and the male gender indicated a bad prognosis .    2.8519480823853947
the patients father deficiency of suffered from bronchial asthma with recurrent respiratory infections .    2.042473237863452
an igg - 3 UNK was detected .    2.5576064122827735
lymphocyte transformation tests showed markedly diminished response to stimulation with anti - UNK monoclonal antibody in both patients , while response to UNK , coa and UNK was normal .    2.4421076562687207
in addition , the concentration of serum soluble interleukin 6 receptor was reduced in both patients .    2.31534022525079
a polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) assay for the detection of dermatophytes was established .    2.4029464567640666
the primers " UNK " and " UNK " amplify a UNK bp fragment within the gene coding for the small UNK subunit ( UNK UNK ) of fungi .    2.6131576371822716
pcr allowed the detection of isolates of 7 common dermatophytes and in addition several yeasts and moulds .    2.3241117504336675
UNK with specific UNK results in the identification of dermatophytes and candida albicans .    2.949655204465455
restriction analysis of the pcr product allowed us to distinguish between dermatophytes and yeasts or moulds .    2.7177300698843427
the specifity of the pcr with respect to fungi was assessed by testing human dna collected from 42 dermis and epidermis specimens as well as dna from selected plants and animals .    2.542316684186099
to evaluate the clinical relevance of the pcr assay , 69 routinely collected skin and nail specimens were examined by pcr and culture .    2.4196603139018804
pcr detected dermatophytes in 35 and culture in 28 of 38 specimens that were classified as positive .    2.242581586512079
sensitivity of pcr ( 92 % ) was higher than that of culture ( 73 % ) .    2.612182935311557
these results show that pcr has advantages over culture for the detection of dermatophytes .    2.5516316943356996
starting with the recommendations of the " psychiatrie - enquête " , a current empirical stock - taking was undertaken about the structure of care in psychiatric hospital units .    2.196463351194782
319 treatment units ( 289 in germany , 11 in austria , and 19 in switzerland ) were investigated concerning size of the treatment unit , number of wards , centrality of admission , existence of large observation rooms ( " UNK " ) , UNK wards , single sex wards , UNK / sectorization , open - door wards , coercive measures , and intended structural changes .    2.3417551107839696
the return rate of questionnaires amounted 59 % .    2.303528599325736
the results show that the recommendations of the " psychiatrie - enquête " are mostly realized today , but not UNK .    2.5375277682211905
across countries differences resulted in size of ward , centrality of admission , open - door wards , and coercive measures .    2.0216534697255835
treatment units in the western and eastern parts of germany differed in size of ward and centrality of admission .    2.104036292675029
differences between psychiatric hospitals , psychiatric departments at general hospitals and psychiatric university hospitals were , though significant , smaller than expected in the light of past controversies .    2.0897517144945215
intended structural changes mainly concerned open - door wards , internal sectorization , UNK of admission , and mixing the sexes in single sex wards .    2.2048616445181715
using high - resolution ultrasound , we acquire pictures that postoperatively allow us to determine the position of the UNK .    2.7648352706411594
many patients would like to UNK some sport activities after total knee replacement ; however , most recommendations are based on subjective opinion rather than scientific evidence .    2.350121408908357
methods : the present experience of the authors UNK UNK patients with a total of UNK inguinal hernias , including 200 recurrences .    2.988073150575985
the operative technique is described with emphasis on pitfalls and UNK .    2.3736722027167825
results : analysis of the data concerning the first 403 patients with 1 year complete follow - up reveals a mean ( sem ) operating time of 42 ( 1 . 2 ) min for unilateral and 58 ( 1 . 0 ) min for bilateral hernia repair .    2.88341265465987
mean ( sem ) postoperative hospital stay was 2 ( 0 . 04 ) days .    2.7262619427596073
complication rates during and after operation were 0 . 3 % and 3 . 3 % respectively .    3.7301751180427916
the morbidity rate at 1 month after operation was 3 . 5 % .    3.0997533922780085
the recurrence rate was 0 . 3 % at 1 - year follow - up .    3.3709437263680204
conclusion : totally preperitoneal endoscopic inguinal hernia repair is safe and reproducible for any type of primary or recurrent inguinal hernia , even in patients with previous UNK surgery or severe systemic disease .    2.499616755521393
background : the aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively whether there are differences in UNK measurable parameters of the fundus between patients with early and late age - related maculopathy ( arm ) , the children of the arm patients ( UNK generation ) and normals .    2.438784493246502
in approximately 4 - 10 % of patients presenting with renal cell cancer the transluminal propagation of a tumor thrombus into the vena cava inferior or the right atrium comes to diagnosis .    2.6217301155120545
recent investigations have indicated that the presence of neoplastic extension into the venous system does not reveal independent prognostic value regarding the clinical course of the disease .    2.4775836023959807
although the complete surgical removal of vena cava thrombosis in patients without simultaneously occurring regional lymph node or distant metastases has become a well established treatment modality , several questions concerning this surgical strategy still remain the subject of ongoing discussions .    2.2229277928645046
in the present investigation that included 92 patients with renal cell cancer and intracaval neoplastic extension it was clearly demonstrated that the use of cardiopulmonary bypass , deep hypothermia and circulatory arrest preferably during the removal of intracaval thrombosis extending into the right atrium does not result in a substantially increased treatment - related intra - or postoperative mortality .    2.2680541493328534
however , in contrast to a previously reported observation this treatment option did not reveal any substantial impact on the long - term survival of the patients following surgical therapy .    2.9680862414947797
accordingly , the cranial extension of intracaval thrombosis was not identified as a biological variable of any prognostic importance for renal cell cancer patients .    2.223391861321796
vascular surgery or penile prosthesis implantation are the main surgical options for erectile dysfunction .    2.4343473190207785
in this category , penile revascularization is the only causal therapy for selected patients : males younger than 50 years of age at time of surgery , maximum of two risk factors , exclusion of diabetes mellitus .    2.3623754026746844
long - term success decreased to 53 % to 55 % in comparison to first encouraging reports of 80 % success .    2.612840215229374
venous surgery resulted in an even more distinct decline of success the longer the UNK of time after surgery .    2.712894502914438
long - term success dropped under 40 % , leaving only a few indications for penile venous ligation .    2.4597421065381035
in contrast , penile prosthesis implantation results in high satisfaction rates .    2.192630899545701
despite this , it is not generally recommended as first choice surgical management as it is linked to irreversible damage of the UNK bodies .    3.1787699625619266
among numerous types of penile implants , preference is nowadays mostly given to the three - piece hydraulic models .    2.1654764836615654
however , such complications as defective or perforated UNK in up to 35 % after 5 years have arisen , depending on the type of implant .    2.449229124442994
in a selected patient group , vacuum constriction devices with a mean patient acceptance of 75 % ( 50 % to 90 % ) seldom result in complications and are thus considered to be a well - established therapeutical option .    2.383237208416266
in a series of UNK and brain imaging studies , we examined pre - and postsynaptic mechanisms of dopaminergic neurotransmission in non - human primates and in schizophrenic and alcohol - dependent patients .    2.6484888158466484
among alcoholics , we found indicators of a sensitization of dopaminergic neurotransmission , which was associated with the relapse risk , but not with anhedonia or depression .    2.6843647024692774
schizophrenics with neuroleptic blockade of striatal dopamine d2 receptors displayed psychomotor slowing and reduced motivation , but not anhedonia .    2.1573842557823038
primate studies pointed to the importance of a UNK - cortical dysfunction in the pathogenesis of UNK dopaminergic dysregulation in the striatum .    2.930455158892892
these observations indicate that a dysfunction of stimulus - dependent dopamine release may be associated with motivational deficits caused by a reduction in incentive UNK , but not with anhedonia .    2.6940548332377245
any operation for lung cancer that is planned as curative includes dissection of the lymph nodes in the mediastinum in order to allow correct staging of the disease .    2.5612070751348863
it is well known that ipsilateral lymph node metastases ( n2 ) mean a poor prognosis .    2.277418159383654
since most patients with this finding die from metastatic tumor progression within 3 years after the operation , it can be assumed that positive findings in the mediastinal lymph nodes represent UNK of the cancer .    2.958146654670049
therefore , the probability of a therapeutic effect from more radical removal of lymph nodes in the mediastinum is rather low .    2.3422314832964406
on the other hand , it is justified to apply and evaluate additional systemic treatment in these tumor stages .    2.4271534162291792
in analogy with high - dose contrast - enhanced ct , there have been a few studies during recent years that have dealt with high - dose paramagnetic contrast dyes in mri .    2.6602242982376065
depending on the clinical problem , a high - dose contrast study in mri is rarely indicated : ( 1 ) in metastatic disease , mr imaging with high - dose contrast material is indicated when the standard dose study is negative or only shows a solitary cerebral lesion or a number of lesions just suitable for radiosurgery ; ( 2 ) in patients with malignant glioma the high - dose study allows better definition of the tumor margins .    2.686308485387272
if a radical surgical approach is planned , the diagnostic potential should be fully used ; if only a biopsy or subtotal debulking is planned , a standard dose study is enough .    2.1248419548668616
( 3 ) in patients with ms , a high - dose study is only recommended within therapeutic trials in which the number of active plaques is a primary variable .    3.3208235749767234
the basic idea of the collaborative family health care is nothing new .    2.3065358245075602
it has its roots in the bio - psycho - social model of medicine developed by UNK UNK in the u . s . a . and it has a long tradition in the german psychosomatic medicine .    2.5528017219834425
at a time of basic changes in our health care system caused by cost considerations owing to the cutting back of resources it is important to note , that collaborative family health care combines aspects of theoretical models and pragmatic action - orientation .    2.007490030815221
the basic is a systemic view of illness and health .    2.499480703497641
the doctor - patient - UNK is in this view enlarged to a treatment - triad composed of the therapist , the patient and his family , to be able to bundle the whole potential at disposal , i . e .    2.293658159247687
the treatment motivation of the patient , the support of the family and the UNK of the therapist .    3.977159637685287
a lot of studies support the resource - saving potential of UNK methods .    2.311961847005731
a potential has to be mobilized , which affects by no means only the costs .    2.42694603242227
at a time of obviously reduced professional solidarity , the UNK of cfhc offer a possibility for physicians , patients and their relatives to reach contentment through cooperation .    2.4793072553359514
interested colleagues are invited to UNK in the german section of the cfhc .    3.2439703267223234
we evaluated the short - to mid - term results of an unconstrained total ankle prosthesis ( s . t . a . r . ) with uncemented fixation .    2.439105576271991
fifty consecutive ankle replacements were performed in 48 patients between 1996 and 1999 .    2.531130210547537
the initial diagnosis was posttraumatic osteoarthrosis in 31 cases ( 62 % ) , primary osteoarthrosis in 8 cases ( 16 % ) , and systemic joint affection in 11 cases ( 22 % ) , e . g . rheumatoid arthritis ( 6 cases ) , UNK ( 2 cases ) , psoriasis arthritis ( 1 case ) , lupus UNK ( 1 case ) , and UNK ( 1 case ) .    3.0130990114808722
there were two perioperative complications : one superficial wound dehiscence that healed uneventfully , and one injury to the dorsal foot artery that necessitated primary reconstruction .    2.0508756072302137
seven revisions , all in cases of posttraumatic arthrosis , were necessary : local revision of the fibula for painful lateral impingement ( 3 cases ) , posteromedial soft tissue revision for painful restriction of dorsiflexion ( 2 cases ) , percutaneous lengthening of the achilles tendon ( 1 case ) , and osteotomy and callus distraction for angular correction after stress fracture of the distal tibia ( 1 case ) .    2.238529783077815
at the last follow - up control , 21 patients ( 62 % ) were very satisfied , 10 patients ( 29 % ) were satisfied , and 3 patients ( 9 % ) were satisfied with reservations .    3.250952343548108
the obtained range of motion was 30 ° ( range , 15 to 55 ° ) , with a maximal plantarflexion of 25 ° ( range , 15 to 45 ° ) and dorsiflexion of 5 ° ( - 3 to 20 ° ) .    2.4459809703329487
when the aofas - hindfoot - score was applied , the 34 patients scored 84 . 1 points ( range , 44 to 100 points ) .    2.0377614612400663
after UNK of the implants within 6 weeks , no migration was noted in any case , and all implants were considered to be stable .    3.1746383796261965
the favorable results were considered to be a result of the mechanical properties of the s . t . a . r . total ankle prosthesis that allows for unconstrained motion of the polyethylene inlay on the tibial component , e . g . anteroposterior translation , UNK translation and axial rotation .    2.33845452915774
although our first results are very encouraging , a longer follow - up is mandatory to answer the question whether ankle replacement is a viable alternative to ankle arthrodesis .    2.2987687137648485
in a prospective study , the influence of the status of the peri - implant hard and soft tissues on the success of UNK dental implants in tumor patients was assessed .    2.6871767336550287
out of 59 tumor patients with 261 implants , treated between july 1988 and august 1996 , a pool of 23 patients with 99 implants provided with dentures for at least 1 year was obtained .    2.0507459286448455
eighteen of these patients suffered from a squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity .    3.5230279540142937
seventeen patients underwent preoperative radiation ( 40 gy ) .    2.264918704569765
a total of 68 out of 99 implants were inserted into autologous bone transplanted to reconstruct the mandible .    2.2200885555681347
in order to assess the peri - implant hard and soft tissues , the hygiene index , the sulcus bleeding index , the UNK index , the pocket - probing depth , the peri - implant bone resorption , and the UNK were used .    2.673319742143075
tumor patients had significantly worse peri - implant parameters than nontumor patients .    2.293565570254976
the peri - implant pocket - probing depth proved to have significant influence on the success rate .    2.6065857557618
the overall success rate was 77 . 8 % .    2.660329938232683
many articles in the literature document the fact that postoperative pain therapy has not improved for decades despite new insights into pain physiology , the availability of powerful analgesics and the development of new techniques .    2.640241852206974
this project was set up to develop practical , effective , safe , and easy to run acute pain therapy .    2.0589604216174098
a 26 - year - old man sustained a c2 arc fracture .    2.515593592262252
ventral spondylodesis using an h - plate was performed .    2.3761277562055687
the patient developed a UNK fistula which remained undetected for 1 year .    2.422536624980322
spontaneous fusion of c3 / c4 and osteolysis of the cortical block occurred .    2.0328111247881337
the fistula was demonstrated intraoperatively and the implant was UNK removed .    2.7198527481769217
no further problems occurred after this unusual method of treatment .    2.494036710189165
the anatomy of the cervical spine , special problems of intensive care patients and the use of proper instrumentation are discussed .    3.3545985192525127
an UNK block of the brachial plexus was combined with general anaesthesia for repair of a complex chronic lesion of the shoulder .    2.855885871845528
the localisation of the plexus with electro - stimulation and the injection of bupivacain 0 . 5 % were accomplished easily and without painful sensations .    2.536406364485701
48 hours later the block was still partially present .    2.4033673513907763
paraesthesia and a sensory and motor innervation deficit affected mainly the dorsal fascicle , but also areas innervated by the median and lateral UNK .    2.11845771374402
the deficit did not completely disappear for 18 month .    2.2392806505494667
the cause could have been due to direct traumatisation during blockade or operation , toxic action of the injected substance ( bupivacain 0 , 5 % , 30 ml ) , distension of the plexus , a cervical syndrome or an aseptic UNK , although a definite determination is not possible .    2.2902438472680666
however , the pattern of the lesion and the lack of pain during localisation of the plexus and injection favour traumatisation during the acromioplasty .    2.5312042845770106
UNK photography allows documentation of naevi in a map - like fashion .    2.106759381058066
the localization of multiple naevi is no longer a problem , as one can scan the film .    2.4671015907402674
comparison of the magnified film with the patient can be done in day - light .    2.6853708654043293
magnification up to 48 times is possible .    2.478462387535104
detection of early changes of the naevi , during the horizontal growth phase , should increase the 5 - year survival rate .    2.5371013249692806
in the ancient times , aristotle , UNK , and galen discovered basic anatomical structures .    2.5651984056043204
paul von UNK , in the seventh century a . c . , had the idea of a nerve suture , which was first performed in an animal 1000 years later by the italian surgeon UNK UNK .    2.4972049143452786
within 1 week in summer UNK , two french surgeons ( UNK and UNK ) independently carried out the first nerve sutures in humans .    2.2815069806053665
their observations of an immediate functional recovery of the appropriate muscles after suturing were discussed controversially in scientific circles .    2.0550686423422455
purpose : to analyze the value of electrophysiologic testing according to standards of the international society for clinical UNK of vision ( iscev ) in infants less than 10 years of age .    2.2703906122928164
aggressive angiomyxoma ( aam ) is a tumor of the soft tissues predominantely occurring in the genital and pelvic area with a strong propensity to local recurrences .    2.435023642678702
the entity was first described in 1983 .    2.7897597638656593
the tumor is regarded as low - grade sarcoma by some authors ; its cause and pathogenesis are presently unknown .    2.3744111871093234
this is a case report on a 27 - year - old man who underwent 4 surgical procedures of the left lower extremity because of a recurrent soft tissue neoplasm , initially ( august 1993 ) diagnosed as a UNK .    2.716002838700537
the patient suffered from recurrences in february 1995 , september 1996 and february 1998 .    2.2070162371210085
the diagnosis was revised at the time of the latest recurrence .    2.7048703713191236
a palliative resection with macroscopic residuals left was performed in february 1998 , followed by a radiation therapy with 56 gy total dose and a concomitant administration of the UNK razoxane per os .    2.6741660148030215
the single radiation doses were 200 UNK 5 times a week .    2.2813288132936442
the small residuals of the tumor obviously regressed although an objective response could not be shown because the lesion was not clearly measurable .    2.4545654235896204
the time of the local control achieved as yet is already longer than any former time to regrowth between the surgical procedures .    2.30902810955826
this is , to our knowledge , the first description of a therapeutic irradiation of a recurrent aggressive angiomyxoma .    2.785807171591874
radiation therapy combined with the UNK razoxane is able to control a recurrent aam for an unknown time .    2.759360467147756
it remains open whether a radiation treatment alone would have had a similar effect .    2.221424394167386
UNK of motor and sensitive nerves in the head and neck area today has an established range of indications .    2.328542170605883
surgical procedures of external and internal UNK , nerve UNK and nerve transplantation techniques are well standardized .    2.295562937395158
with UNK of motor nerves , satisfying or good results can be generally obtained .    2.6213468758134524
success rates exceeding 50 % following sensitive nerve reconstructions justify the performance of the procedures , more so because of the subjective improvements for the individual patient .    2.4602532152073726
perspectives can be seen in further simplification of surgical methods of harvesting nerve grafts , e . g . , by development of minimally invasive , eventually endoscopically guided procedures .    2.197843069021396
allogenic nerve grafts may also be applied .    3.1329786126662853
initial experiments with nerve UNK are encouraging .    2.561459115257662
a better understanding of nerve lesions on cellular and molecular biological levels may improve our knowledge of posttraumatic regulatory procedures and may lead to future possibilities of nonsurgical treatment options for peripheral and central nerve lesions by guided regeneration .    2.1704354687673155
objective : the acceptance of fibromyalgia as a disease entity and its definitive diagnosis have been hampered by a UNK of knowledge concerning the underlying pathophysiology of this disease and the lack of specific biochemical markers applicable to its diagnosis .    2.631873015191043
to determine whether abnormal collagen metabolism is a characteristic of fibromyalgia , we have analyzed collagen metabolites in the urine and serum of patients with fibromyalgia .    2.7707346251797307
methods : the diagnosis of fibromyalgia was made according to the american college of rheumatology criteria .    2.967602468373799
urine and serum were collected under standardized conditions from 39 patients and 55 age - and sex - matched controls .    2.2723444505543644
UNK ( pyd ) and UNK ( dpyd ) , which represent products of UNK oxidase - mediated cross - linking in collagen and are indicators of connective tissue and bone degradation , respectively , were analyzed by ion - paired and gradient hplc method with fluorescence detection ( hplc ) .    2.1801273253482596
levels of UNK ( hyp ) , a collagen turnover marker , were also measured .    2.7754050292895807
the findings were related to creatinine levels and the pyd / dpyd ratio determined .    2.303709327555046
the pyd / dpyd ratios in the urine and serum and the hyp in the urine were significantly lower in patients with fibromyalgia than in healthy controls .    2.5142373552798505
analysis of altered collagen metabolism either by histologic examination on biopsy or , preferably , by hplc analysis of collagen metabolites in urine or serum may aid to understand more about the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia .    2.0048799617827537
background : the dynamic radionuclide nephrography ( UNK - UNK ) is an important method in the evaluation of obstruction of the upper urinary tract .    3.593908400870357
the aim of the present study was to assess whether UNK nephrography under standardized conditions with adequate hydration and UNK induced diuresis can reliably detect a significant obstruction at the UNK - ureteric junction .    2.2161693301153447
we therefore tested whether minimal tracer washout ( 10 - 25 % ) in the presence of normal renal function could UNK a non - operative managment .    2.9528945436516287
the lateral decubitus position is the standard position for UNK .    2.727162324214147
there is a lack of data about the effects of this extreme position upon respiratory mechanics and gas exchange .    2.5837219584309774
in 20 patients undergoing surgery in the nephrectomy position , we compared a new closed - loop - controlled ventilation algorithm , adaptive lung ventilation ( alv ) , which UNK the breathing pattern automatically , to the respiratory mechanics with conventionally controlled mandatory ventilation ( cmv ) .    2.4875053556756366
the aims of our study were ( 1 ) to describe positioning effects on respiratory mechanics and gas exchange , ( 2 ) to UNK ventilatory parameters selected by the alv controller with traditional settings of cmv , and ( 3 ) to assess the individual adaptation of the ventilatory parameters by the alv controller .    2.529857715289847
the respirator used was a modified UNK ventilator , which is controlled by an external computer and possesses an integrated lung function analyzer .    2.34971693141546
in a first set of measurements , we compared parameters of respiratory mechanics and gas exchange in the horizontal supine position and 20 min after changing to the nephrectomy position .    2.2694305373338852
in a second set of measurements , patients were ventilated with alv and cmv using a randomized crossover design .    2.209423809515994
the cmv settings were a tidal volume of 10 ml / kg body weight , a respiratory rate of 10 UNK / min , an i : e ratio of 1 : 1 . 5 , and an end - inspiratory UNK of 30 % of inspiratory time .    2.675386920090338
with both ventilation modes fio2 was set to 0 . 5 and peep to 3 cm h2o .    2.5979363804223925
during alv a desired alveolar ventilation of 70 ml / kg kg - min was preset .    2.258119215383738
all other ventilatory parameters were determined by the alv controller according to the instantaneously measured respiratory parameters .    2.800151413399889
positioning induced a reduction of compliance from 61 . 6 to 47 . 9 ml / cm h2o ; the respiratory time constant shortened from 1 . 2 to 1 . 08 s , whereas physiological dead space increased from 158 . 9 to 207 . 5 ml .    2.3970352009969447
on average , the ventilatory parameters selected by the alv controller resembled very closely those used with cmv .    2.0840840217305097
however , an adaptation to individual respiratory mechanics was clearly evident with alv .    2.083024870122102
in conclusion , we found that the effects of positioning for nephrectomy are minor and may give rise to problems only in patients with restrictive lung disease .    2.7662164642135214
the novel alv controller automatically UNK ventilatory parameters that are clinically sound and are better adapted to the respiratory mechanics of ventilated patients than the standardized settings of cmv are .    2.0505328200316946
the defects are usually unilateral .    2.830294316599337
children from economically UNK countries are predominantly affected .    2.3498354853761962
medically untreated the disease has a high mortality rate , which can be dramatically lowered by adequate antibiotic therapy started in time .    2.597580418247471
predisposing factors include UNK , immunosuppression , and poor oral hygiene .    2.4205404395537444
forty - eight noma patients were surgically treated in UNK , nigeria during october 1997 by an UNK germany team sponsored by UNK UNK UNK .    2.3802470211135867
interdisciplinary surgical strategies and results , e . g . ankylosis release , local flap coverage and 12 pedicled musculocutaneous latissimus dorsi UNK flaps , as well as a noma classification ( UNK ) , are presented .    2.488673880387071
during a period of 3 years , four UNK clinical studies in 34 patients with hypercholesterolaemia and 40 healthy persons - in some cases with stratification of the basic cholesterol levels and matched pair formation - were performed to find out the effects of serial sun - like uv irradiation on various serum parameters and blood circulation functions .    2.2914944559023054
the following significant effects were observed .    2.619213563426
patients with hypercholesterolaemia : increase of hdl cholesterol after termination of the serial uv irradiation , increase of serum 25 ( oh ) d3 levels , decrease of serum UNK , decrease of serum lactate ; healthy persons : decrease of resting pulse rate , decrease of recovery pulse rate , decrease of systolic blood pressure .    1.9102147616802845
all effects were induced by application of UNK uv doses , i . e .    2.486698444342979
amounts of uv with a relatively low risk of side effects .    2.7002458228244377
in 1998 minor et al .    2.479195391309146
described a new variant of UNK fistula : the " superior canal dehiscence syndrome " .    2.2739990478547476
this syndrome is clinically characterized by recurrent attacks of vertigo and UNK induced by loud noises or stimuli that result in changes in intracranial or middle ear pressure .    2.018925619747535
it is caused by a dehiscence of bone overlying the superior ( anterior ) semicircular canal .    2.3291290514085783
due to this dehiscence , a third , mobile window ( in addition to the round and oval windows ) is formed , and changes in pressure are pathologically UNK to the anterior semicircular canal .    2.2871435120857893
in the present study we evaluated proprioceptive capabilities of the knee joint with a balance test and correlated these findings to parameters which document mechanical stability .    2.1392589732568457
we compared 8 conservatively treated and 12 surgically treated patients with acl - deficient knee joints with a control group of 12 subjects .    2.46378949210223
the balance test was performed with a UNK force plate .    3.3663952723674
both the conservatively treated and the surgically treated patients showed significantly higher deviations of their centre of gravity than the control group .    2.222684901847625
this was true not only for the injured leg but also for the UNK contralateral leg .    2.760240605485242
the differences were most remarkable when comparing the entire distance of centre of gravity deviations during 10 s . additionally , the conservatively treated patients interrupted the test procedure significantly more frequently than the other two groups .    2.05211642108871
we were not able to document any correlation between proprioceptive function and parameters for joint stability such as anterior drawer , UNK , pivot shift and kt - 1000 measurements .    2.0783005043728697
the study examined the validity of psychometric measures for the assessment of driving ability in brain - damaged subjects .    2.473283135183818
116 patients with brain damage mainly of vascular and traumatic origin underwent extensive neuropsychological examinations emphasizing attentional performance and visual perceptual speed and participated in a comprehensive on - road driving test .    1.9304554349682577
in view of the frequent impairment in driving ability after brain damage and in view of the failure to reliably predict driving ability from psychometric test results , it is recommended that in each case an on - road driving test is given .    2.269562976177563
in the planning of laser surgery for ent operations , the specialist is often consulted by the anesthesiologist to predict possible intubation problems .    2.1010466686677836
intubation problems in such operations can occur frequently due to the pathological findings present in the upper aerodigestive tract and the different constructions of laser - resistant endotracheal tubes .    2.611559233405174
the aim of this study was to determine if a known predictive parameter could have a sufficient sensitivity and specificity to reliably predict possible intubation problems for ent - related laser surgery .    1.9117641825728773
in a prospective study , 91 patients were included and the UNK - score modified by UNK and young was analyzed and compared to a score describing the actual conditions of intubation .    2.805961402945166
the results showed a significant correlation ( p < 0 . 05 , chi - square test ) .    2.4665170777078016
however , the specificity was only 72 % and the sensitivity of 60 % was too low to be of practical use .    2.490224922348762
the results were independent of the endotracheal tube used .    3.0311685649551525
although use of the laser for ent operations provides a special situation for the anesthesiologist , there is still no system that is sensitive and specific enough to be of practical use .    2.6223820187213995
this problem is demonstrated in a literature review .    3.098164847587192
the treatment of patients with deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism with contraindications for a thrombolytic therapy is a therapeutic challenge .    2.8656360427590437
we report on a 12 year old patient who was treated for large cell lymphoma according to nhl - UNK 95 : block aa protocol .    2.2498215069660454
because of cerebral metastasis a fibrinolytic therapy was contraindicated .    2.2554526812396647
therefore , we performed a mechanical thrombectomy using the UNK thrombectomy device .    2.616755125518874
the postinterventional scintigraphy showed a markedly improved pulmonary perfusion ; UNK 4 months UNK showed a patent right femoral vein .    2.038162139662734
within this chapter , tumors which produce bone matrix ( osteoid ) or other bone - forming tissues , like cartilage , connective tissue , and UNK or originate within the bone marrow are described .    2.2231308640212877
in addition , those lesions are mentioned which , according to the who , are typical for the UNK and are therefore included within the 1992 who classification of odontogenic tumors .    2.6627577280455346
vascular and epithelial tumors which may also be observed in the jaws are not described .    2.8726753685358375
all the lesions and tumors reported have in common a more or less similar clinical and radiological appearance .    2.359920114134707
a precise diagnosis , therefore , can only be established by a sufficient biopsy which should be seen by a pathologist with experience in this field .    2.6732592998119986
in addition to clinical , radiological , and histological appearances , therapeutic necessities are described .    2.3423341509739717
the data from recent publications are taken into account .    2.556861092334766
this presentation is based on the data collected within the reference registry of the german - austrian - swiss study group of tumors of the face and jaws ( dösak ) in basel .    2.663402321126625
between 1987 and 1996 302 patients were treated for colorectal liver metastases .    2.741557321983711
out of this pool UNK completely documented cases were analysed .    2.3536054727810556
forty - five patients ( 18 % ) of this population were 70 years or older at time of admission .    2.7885478931100547
in this population 17 major resections and 8 minor liver resections were performed .    2.193171506571864
in 9 patients UNK metastases were diagnosed during treatment of the primary tumor .    2.83611742131034
in 3 cases laparotomy had to be finished as exploration .    2.7892074675564937
eight patients were treated without surgery .    3.2590659253837333
mortality after liver resection was 4 % , morbidity 28 % .    2.8959336123005253
the 5 - year - survival - rate ( kaplan - meier ) of the r0 resected patients ( n = 21 ) was 44 % .    2.743654220362383
comparison between the elderly patients and the younger population shows no significant differences in type and extent of treatment or in stage of disease .    2.751222388866868
survival , morbidity and mortality after liver resection also show no significant differences .    2.920371848491912
these results show that even in elderly patients liver resection for colorectal metastases can be performed UNK and with a curative intention .    2.703963221647184
the clinical course of 12 patients with mushroom poisoning was evaluated in order to define the parameters considered to be relevant to the indication for liver transplantation .    3.1231520487695588
in three patients transplantations had to be performed because of severe liver failure .    3.0765550765448406
on admission , the transplanted patients had a decreased quick ' s test score and factor v value ( < 10 % ) .    2.1945277227825146
the peak of liver enzymes , serum bilirubin , serum creatinine , partial thromboplastin time and UNK were not of any prognostic value .    2.307011200427632
main indications for liver transplantation were a very low initial quick ' s test score and factor v value ( both < 10 % ) and their inadequate response under substitution therapy .    2.2960070492223204
the development of encephalopathy and renal failure were further parameters indicating poor prognosis .    2.257081955543963
during submaximal UNK back extension loading ( 31 male persons ) surface - emg was measured using 16 monopolar - linked electrodes in the low back region ( l 3 - s 1 ) .    1.9027968233512433
by means of modification of amplitude - and frequency parameters in the emg - signal two subject groups ( 6 persons each ) with the slightest and most severe muscle fatigue in the UNK region were defined .    2.2216176077336875
for the analysis of muscle coordination , the emg signal on the basis of an amplitude estimate at the beginning and at the end of the load situation was compared .    2.736238872396367
during the extension phase , the group with slight fatigability showed no different spatial pattern of myoelectrical activity at the end of investigation than at the beginning .    2.311356103014794
in contrast to this , the pattern of myoelectrical activity changed during the endurance test in the group of persons with considerable fatigability .    2.5199532457209384
therefore , in addition to the muscular fatigue also the loss of muscle coordination has to be taken into account in the assessment of spinal function .    2.9171280574416274
background : a UNK flow reserve ( ffrmyo ) < 0 . 75 is a well validated parameter for significance of coronary stenoses in cases of normal myocardial function .    2.5196175260584517
we used the ffrmyo limit in patients with impaired myocardial perfusion by myocardial infarction and / or hypertension for intermediate stenoses of the lad for decision to ptca and checked the indication by clinical follow - up .    2.40619858166962
distraction osteogenesis of the mandible is one treatment option in mandibular hypoplasia .    2.695912555503761
the aim of the present study was to establish continuous bone distraction using a microhydraulic cylinder .    2.175339423303318
using a submandibular approach , the mandible was dissected UNK on one side in four mini - pigs ; corticotomy was performed and the microhydraulic cylinder fixed with two UNK screws .    2.136385510457229
the hydraulic tube was connected with an automatic UNK UNK system .    2.3737325104350777
following 7 days at rest , a continuous distraction of 1 . 5 mm per day was performed for 14 days .    2.7286394569660914
after 2 and 4 weeks postoperatively , the animals were killed and x - rays taken .    2.887161819573097
the mandible was then removed en bloc and microscopic evaluation of the sections was performed .    2.5171389437326295
the continuous stimulus did induce direct mineralisation of longitudinal oriented collagenous fibre bundles .    1.9658446144660802
bony regeneration seems to be accelerated , which might reduce the postoperatively stabilizing phase .    2.715183310216909
the duration of spinal anaesthesia in infants is short compared to adult patients .    2.2842208993636053
when UNK is used , the addition of epinephrine significantly prolongs the duration .    2.733147962721712
for bupivacaine , however , the influence of epinephrine on the duration is not clear .    3.4941851121731955
we investigated the effects of epinephrine 1 : 200 000 added to bupivacaine 0 . 5 % on duration and haemodynamics .    2.6749897478045734
ten former pre - term infants with postnatal respiratory problems , scheduled for bilateral inguinal hernia repair , were enrolled in the study after informed parental consent had been obtained .    2.1493894418956345
if they did not receive i . v .    2.4913730736337354
infusions before surgery , a bolus of 10 ml / kg UNK ' s acetate was injected after inserting the i . v .    2.440654410191472
cannula , followed by a continuous infusion of 8 ml / kg 2 / 3 n nacl with 5 % UNK .    2.5929339654501464
spinal anaesthesia was performed in a sitting position with 0 . 6 ml bupivacaine 0 . 5 % .    3.302613689260048
five patients received plain bupivacaine ( group i ) and five bupivacaine with epinephrine 1 : 200 000 ( group ii ) .    2.2120187128108597
heart rate registered by ecg and non - invasive blood pressure were recorded prior to positioning the baby for lumbar puncture and 2 , 5 , 10 , and 20 min after injection of bupivacaine .    2.381578886617489
the duration of spinal anaesthesia was defined as the time from injection to the time when the first movements of the legs were observed after stimulation .    2.808765971873474
for testing statistical differences the u test was used between the groups and the wilcoxon and UNK test within the groups .    2.308375573617757
results ( expressed as median and range ) .    2.3468222969776855
additional epinephrine significantly prolonged the duration of spinal anaesthesia ( group ii : 95 min [ 60 - 120 ] vs group i : 50 min [ 37 - 85 ] ) .    2.2176218728117454
haemodynamic parameters did not differ at any time between or within the groups .    2.5874396655058756
in group i , one infant had high spinal anaesthesia with impaired respiration but without cardiovascular effects ; after 10 min of assisted ventilation by mask , sufficient respiration as judged by pulse oximetry and clinical observation had returned .    1.8896606102872335
the duration of spinal anaesthesia in this child was 60 min .    2.4327502553246094
epinephrine 1 : 200 000 significantly prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia in former preterm infants .    2.306800911840412
haemodynamic parameters in this age group remain unchanged during spinal anaesthesia and are not influenced by the addition of epinephrine .    2.530921695014715
we UNK to investigate whether additional factors might influence this debate .    2.546380491134081
most familial dilated cardiomyopathy pedigrees show an autosomal pattern of inheritance .    2.2736959326521466
very few of them are x - linked and UNK .    2.830975533596264
autosomal recessive inheritance is difficult to be assessed in an evidence - based setting .    2.675335663797002
by linkage analysis , several loci , but no disease gene , have been identified .    2.6480534402317217
at present , few cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy can benefit of a molecular diagnosis .    2.2892821009268993
particularly the new developments in the hospital sector will be UNK regarding the dynamics of risk selection and risk externalization .    2.633477840905825
the new economic ways of financing the hospital sector are inducing the need of systematic integration of the different branches of social law , especially more developed networks of the health care , the nursing system , and the social care services .    2.5526499597573316
purpose : the inactive form of pyruvatekinase could be established in different tumours .    2.298359789899562
purpose of this study was to UNK the presence or absence of the inactive form of pyruvatekinase in renal cell carcinoma , metastases and benign renal tissue by immunohistology .    2.5970734543440797
introduction : the hemodynamic parameters of 95 patients undergoing maxillary or bimaxillary orthognathic surgery in 1996 and 1997 at the department of UNK surgery / plastic surgery , krefeld , germany , were analyzed retrospectivly to study the effect of intraoperative blood loss .    2.3638692898835862
materials and methods : the parameters included the blood loss volume , age , weight and sex of the patients , the mode of osteotomy and the operation time , the surgeon , the average blood pressure , the infusion volume , the anesthesiologist , the thrombocyte counts and their function , the activity of the coagulation factors ii , v , vii , viii , ix , x , xi , UNK , UNK and von - willebrand - factor , and the pathological coagulation factor counts of each patient , the rate of autologous blood donation and the rate of retransfusion .    2.7288275225581105
statistical analysis was done using the UNK - UNK - test .    4.017533045404182
results : the average blood loss during maxillary osteotomy was 670 + / - 380 ml and during bimaxillary surgery UNK + / - UNK ml .    2.5444438064867447
operations of more than 3 . 5 h in length led to a blood loss of 1200 + / - 520 ml as opposed to 670 + / - 310 ml .    3.009587278371198
the average blood loss among various surgeons was between 670 ml and UNK ml of various anesthesiologists between UNK ml and 1200 ml , without statistical evidence .    1.9504614617682845
some 17 . 9 % of patients showed pathological UNK function concerning medication with aspirin ; 34 . 7 % had pathological activities of coagulation factors , but only 2 . 1 % with clinical significance .    2.7922463821449974
conclusion : mode of operation , maxillary or bimaxillary , und length of operation were the most significant factors of intraoperative blood loss .    2.2143063819636377
patients with pathological coagulation had nearly the same rate of blood loss as patients with physiological coagulation .    2.3044435093549485
in most cases this was determined by restriction of aspirin .    2.6425644392452883
analysis of the rate of autologous blood retransfusion showed a significant correlation to blood loss in bimaxillary surgery .    3.0699020147968716
maxillary osteotomy led to a retransfusion of only 14 . 2 % of autologous blood unit .    3.0821561271125915
this should be reviewed critically especially concerning costs .    2.310462017817133
purpose : course and pathophysiology of a typical syndrome after irradiation of the cauda equina were studied .    2.1900364001332577
only 18 cases in childhood have been reported .    2.6574465503270823
we report on a 5 - year - old girl who showed the typical biphasic and recurrent course of the disease : initially edematous - UNK lesions associated with blisters , followed by morphea - like changes on the extremities .    2.3967049957419855
eosinophilia of peripheral blood was apparent , which , however , was not correlated with the severity of the current condition .    3.3314891069831933
after a recurrent course for 4 months and intermittent systemic administration of antibiotics ( on the assumption of erysipelas and phlegmon ) and glucocorticosteroids , the disease healed without sequelae .    2.200305933958893
UNK : wells ' syndrome is probably more common than believed and should be included in the differential diagnosis of urticarial , morphea - like and bullous eruptions in childhood .    2.1637795252945358
in 1996 , several employees of the french governmental organization for blood collection and transfusions ( UNK ) have been UNK by ordinary courts .    2.5109712549167016
they were found guilty in the UNK on hiv - infected blood transfusions .    3.041078007732616
over 3800 persons , mostly hemophiliacs , have been infected in france and suffer from hiv disease .    2.1695487502741333
many of them died already .    2.8659508756977226
the public in france urgently demanded the UNK of the persons who were UNK responsible for the time delay that postponed the introduction of hiv - tests for blood UNK in france .    2.7807443397938947
such a test was available from the american company abbott in the early 1985 , but the french authorities preferred to wait for the hiv - test from UNK - diagnostics .    2.2628126836139932
a special court , the " court de justice de la UNK " , authorized to judge on members of the UNK , has been created by the french UNK on UNK . 23 , 1993 .    2.5752703134344825
six years later , the three politicians , the former prime minister laurent fabius , the minister for social affairs , UNK UNK dufoix , and her UNK of state for health , mr . edmond hervé , have been accused of involuntary homicide .    2.034027220154624
march , 9 , 1999 , after five weeks of UNK and statements , the UNK UNK his UNK : the former prime minister laurent fabius and the minister g . dufoix were discharged , but the UNK of state for health , edmond hervé , has been declared guilty .    2.5268813799835073
however , also mr . hervé could leave the court room as a free person , because the president of the court , mr . christian le UNK , UNK ' t want to UNK a judgement against him , as mr . hervé had to suffer from almost 15 years of public critics and attacks before he was found guilty .    2.0209968588703013
the hemophiliacs and other aids - patients as well as their families UNK UNK against this judgement .    2.539896445268603
they plan to file charges against the three UNK through a common court to hold them responsible .    2.1096253799262166
classical insight therapy , derived from freud , and ` maternal ' holding therapy , derived from UNK , winnicott and others , are two contrasting treatment techniques in psychoanalysis .    1.9585600211884093
the authors believe that each of these two techniques UNK specific philosophical basic assumptions about the nature of human beings .    2.476773701957711
the position of freud is that of the basically traumatic character of human experience .    2.457413949456076
the contra - position of the object relation psychologists UNK the priority of love in human experience .    2.1842486383436115
these assumptions seem to be more latent than overt guidelines of therapeutical techniques and therefore their reconstruction and UNK have important implications for psychoanalytical therapy .    2.2705468662100565
UNK hearts represent rare complex cardial malformations .    2.2865586195315126
we report a case of a 34 - year old male with single ventricle , two atria , tricuspid atresia , large atrial septal defect , complete transposition and pulmonary UNK stenosis .    2.258857628439767
there were no signs of chronic pulmonary hypertension .    2.6389591105179906
intensive clinical analysis of the cardiac malformation was first performed at the age of five years .    3.2979041990546736
conclusion was that the patient would have no benefit from operation .    2.7198933693339735
the patient had nearly normal live conditions with a profession , family and some UNK activities like UNK .    2.126213602525936
he died of sudden cardiac death .    2.8841552224242375
the malformation was examined by sequential segmental analysis and in comparison with the embryonic development .    2.4857339039637445
clinical picture , prognosis and therapy are reported from literature .    2.865597392314293
during the last years development of cardiac surgery achieved good results .    2.456022315752646
special morphologic constellations , as in our case , may be the reason that conservative therapy can be sufficient for prolonged survival with good quality of life .    2.681129978199113
the assessment and measurement of pain is essential in the implementation and control of pain relieving strategies .    2.5279654578295236
the measurement of pain in infants and children should be based on the consideration of age , cognitive level , psychological status , intercurrent diseases and the social context in order to register the child ' s individual situation and to avoid misinterpretation .    2.710309808801992
from its origin to its death the human organism is submitted to functional , material and morphological changes that are UNK .    2.1028866535794153
these changes permit classifying an individual as young , adult , old , active or UNK .    1.9935721983917378
but this estimation is not always correct .    2.8016733553756357
some appear younger , some older than expected from their UNK age .    2.3112714741396436
but what is ageing and how can it be measured ?    2.2418455295417212
for this , so - called markers or biological markers of ageing are used which are measurable indicators of ageing in live organisms .    2.0667791752039615
a description of the complexity , the asynchronous course and the biological variety and variability of biological age is less successful with a single indicator than with the inclusion of several markers in a multi - factorial measuring system , in a so - called test battery .    2.4255056423265744
various test batteries have already been applied in numerous studies that consist of biochemical scans , mental and also social parameters in different combinations .    2.1065354497797335
a more precise description of such a test battery can be seen in the following discussion of the ilse study .    3.14161045389214
the documentation form for pathohistologic findings ( version iii ) for tumors of the maxillofacial region is presented .    2.241255258188685
it is part of the site - specific documentation of the german association of tumor centers ( UNK ) .    2.949846311533727
its handling is explained by instructions which are based on the icd - o classification and the tnm system .    2.5873193748422145
the prognostic relevance of the standardized documentation has already been proven by various histomorphologic investigations concerning oral and oropharyngeal cancer .    2.1599852191641453
by means of a multicentric observational study the german austrian swiss co - operative group dösak will develop a new prognostic model for oral and oropharyngeal cancer .    1.9908504027987404
the development of a middle ear cholesteatoma is usually associated with chronic inflammation and displacement of the mucosa present by the invading squamous epithelium .    2.304858097581387
to analyze the clinically different behaviors of both epithelia , we used immunohistochemical methods to study the distribution and expression of interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) , transforming growth factor - alpha ( tgf - ) , epidermal growth factor ( egf ) , epidermal growth factor - receptor ( egf - r ) , the proliferation marker mib 1 , c - myc proto - oncogene product and activation marker UNK .    2.3416458380876133
results stromal that keratinocytes in a cholesteatoma exhibited a much higher activation and proliferation rate when compared to middle ear mucosa cells .    2.1407243298125262
middle ear epithelial cells showed no immunoreactivity for tgf - alpha , egf - r , il - 1 and c - myc in contrast to the markedly positive immunoreactivity found in cholesteatoma matrix .    2.357446395016012
the local release of cytokines and growth factors , such as tgf - alpha , egf and il - 1 by inflammatory cells seems to be an important factor for the UNK behavior of cholesteatoma epithelium .    2.821056913172849
our findings could contribute to the pathogenesis of middle ear cholesteatoma and give a possible explanation for the sustained progression of its growth leading to displacement of the middle ear mucosa .    2.683602561260546
the role of hip sonography in neonatal hip screening is still a controversial matter .    2.5283010565721558
this paper reports the results of the austrian ultrasound hip screening program , in which all austrian babies undergo hip sonography twice : at the birth clinic during the 1st week of life and at an age of 12 - 16 weeks .    2.354398933157142
data from all public health insurance companies since 1985 and all icd data about children hospitalized because of cdh in austria were collected and analyzed .    2.0025691959540817
the rate of sonographically pathological hips was 6 . 57 % ( 1994 ) .    2.4238995456425076
the treatment rate before introduction of hip sonography was 13 . 16 % ( 1985 ) .    2.261397023291572
the rate of open reduction went down to 0 . 24 per 1000 newborns , including a high number of UNK children born abroad and also children with UNK dislocation of the hip .    2.591935638528063
hip sonography screening proved to be effective in detecting true instability of the hip joint as well as dysplasia .    3.3633011065684344
the optimal time for sonographic screening does not seem to be immediately after birth when only " high risk " hips ( clinical instability , positive family history , breech delivery ) should undergo hip sonography , but at an age between 4 and 6 weeks when the hip has already shown its true nature .    2.0023462007160124
since one sonographic scan appears to be sufficient for screening , a further reduction of costs could be accomplished .    2.487780085123629
disability owing to ddh can be avoided in a number of cases , and costs for conservative and surgical treatment as well as for later endoprostheses and early retirement can be UNK .    3.092932699559243
transactional analysis ( UNK 1958 ) in its original concepts was intended to help even lay people to understand personal structures and psychodynamic processes .    1.929611660160851
this intention lead some of the following authors to UNK and a " happy - go - lucky " perspective .    2.699763910708231
others , most of all european transactional analysts went back to the roots of the original contents and aims and showed that they offer great clinical relevance for the understanding and treatment of a variety of disturbances .    2.4905087267532697
the structural model of UNK serves to describe the borderline structure , concepts of the frame of reference and the UNK as patterns for the development and maintenance of the pathology , the concepts of transactions , games , UNK and passivity as indicators for the stable instability of the relationships , and UNK and UNK as examples of defence patterns .    2.810504028363974
practical ideas about the therapeutic contract as a basis of various working UNK , about methods of decreasing anxiety in therapeutic processes , and about contact and attachment as a substrate for corrective experiences , a healing UNK and UNK of the process follow .    2.1705765593636652
the article ends with transactional analytic considerations of transference , counter - transference and how to deal with regression processes .    1.983876585015975
after separation of UNK in ocular pemphigoid , transplantation of nasal or UNK mucosa is recommended to prevent recurrent lid fusion ; however , it is not always successful .    2.5979172072582255
the disturbance of generalized UNK ( UNK - UNK disorder ) is an illness , which is often recognised very late .    3.3842645317365543
it is characterised by a uniformity of psychic experience in the face of circumstances which would otherwise give cause for depressiveness , UNK , great anxiety , self - UNK or aggression directed against others .    2.4327011588213945
early diagnosis and specific therapy may decisively improve life - quality of the patients and may also prevent detrimental individual and social long - term consequences .    2.949763232175036
diagnostic methods are morphologic / morphometric analyses , measurement of the global coronary reserve , measurement of the regional coronary microcirculation ( scintigraphy , positron emission tomography ) and laboratory analysis of UNK alterations ( plasma , UNK , leucocytes ) .    2.3490629016519584
after successful angioplasty , normalisation of glutamate extraction rate takes three to six months .    2.127419354429686
in patients with unstable angina , changes in plasma viscosity , erythrocyte aggregation and neutrophil activation occur .    2.3565063059394964
therapeutic improvements of disturbed microvascular flow can be obtained by increasing perfusion pressure ( by revascularisation , nitrates , calcium UNK , physical training ) , by improving the UNK of the blood and by reducing the extravascular component of coronary vascular resistance ( by antihypertensive treatment ) .    2.4070041268415783
intracytoplasmic injection of sperm ( icsi ) extracted from testicular tissue ( tese ) represents the only possibility for men with non - obstructive azoospermia to father a child .    2.0599407794854647
icsi is also the only treatment for men with obstructive azoospermia if microsurgery is not possible or not successful .    2.308802894276134
however , approximately only every fifth treatment cycle leads to a pregnancy .    2.4336276442885008
thus , in most cases , several treatment cycles have to be performed to achieve a pregnancy and therefore testicular biopsies have to be taken several times .    2.985199230900868
cryopreservation of testicular tissue offers the possibility to store testicular tissue for several treatment cycles of in vitro fertilization ( ivf ) and to UNK surgical sperm retrieval in the man and infertility treatment in the woman ( ovarian stimulation , ovum pick - up , embryo transfer ) .    2.1516871733944214
for the man , cryopreservation offers the advantage that only one testicular biopsy has to be performed for diagnostic reasons and for sperm retrieval .    2.409918514103325
the cumulative pregnancy rate of ivf / icsi / tese - cycles can be increased by cryopreservation of supernumerary pronuclear stage oocytes and embryo transfer after UNK in successive cycles .    1.8857894134823756
this study gives a survey of the publications of articles about the care of the newborn around UNK .    2.4246940415613256
a main paediatric and obstetric journal ( archiv für UNK , archiv für UNK ) from the turn of the century were analysed including the years UNK - 1910 .    1.9217373785529164
purpose : to compare electron beam ct ( ebct ) und prospectively ecg gated conventional ct for the detection and quantification of coronary artery calcifications .    2.391747771540229
in europe , saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis represents the only mycotic infection relevant for thoracic surgery .    2.1052814035442666
from the pathogenetic point of view , it is a colonization of preexisting lung or pleural cavities following other severe pulmonary diseases .    2.3615668478475156
the incidence amounts to 0 . 4 % among patients in a special hospital for pulmonary diseases .    2.898135480432358
concerning this review , the diagnosis is based on histologic examination for all 66 patients we operated on between 1961 and 1996 .    2.7896320242380477
preoperative proof of the fungal infection remains difficult .    2.4704649904505085
the majority of patients ( 77 % ) are male .    2.829762549886188
there is a correlation between cigarette smoking and abuse of alcohol on the one hand and the incidence of the disease on the other hand .    2.7649657024257053
a higher incidence of saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis was found for people working in UNK , in the building trade , and in paper UNK .    2.9842672849968137
pulmonary tuberculosis and pneumonia were present in the past history in 47 % of the patients .    3.0226188741668625
major hemoptysis is the most severe and most dangerous complication caused by aspergilloma .    2.603002347976887
clinical presentation and chest x - ray findings are non - characteristic .    2.6015988941823425
nowadays , the typical x - ray of pulmonary aspergilloma , almost always localized in the upper lobes , became a rare finding .    2.5756807525953658
if an UNK infection is suspected , serologic methods are reliable and sensitive .    2.3779475380583364
a surgical procedure is UNK indicated in patients with major hemoptysis in their history , in case of disease progression or indeterminate mass and in order to avoid fungal dissemination .    2.8592255570057916
if a saprophytic aspergillosis is suspected according to radiologic findings , clinical examination , and patient ' s social history , an operation is justified .    2.4902266346265094
relative surgical indications are hepatotoxic and carcinogenic effects of the UNK .    2.9037494262876775
however , this operation is technically demanding and it usually requires a longer operating time as compared to lobectomies for other underlying diseases .    2.262703511934273
peri - and postoperative complications occur in 60 % of resections for pulmonary aspergilloma .    2.779320291628203
a higher incidence of postoperative complications was found for smaller resections , like UNK or wedge resections , as compared to lobectomies .    2.580472617150193
persistent pleural space problems connected with a prolonged stay in the hospital remains the main problem .    2.751055101283461
it requires a primary or secondary thoracoplasty in a number of patients .    2.771704006371041
the operative mortality rate is 3 % .    2.5053147117556875
a systemic antifungal therapy is not an appropriate treatment for saprophytic pulmonary aspergillosis and can even cause specific complications .    2.3960527522230244
introduction : postoperative delirium is a common psychic disturbance occurring acutely after various surgical procedures and typically presenting with a fluctuating course .    2.257385084608764
these patients ' recovery takes longer .    2.4931914426135178
methods : patients undergoing elective arterial operations were included .    2.3839254396282783
their medical history , the specific vascular diagnosis and operation performed , the medication and laboratory data were monitored .    2.3984688175679456
additionally the patients were preoperatively interviewed by a psychiatrist .    2.866146067177049
intraoperatively the drugs , infusions , possible transfusions , blood gases and pressures were monitored , as were the times of surgery and anesthesia .    2.192290935196148
postoperatively patients were seen daily by the psychiatrist and the surgeon for at least 7 days .    2.27747307588954
postoperative delirium was diagnosed according to dsm iv criteria , and mild , moderate and severe delirium were distinguished .    2.147065731753829
results : fifty - four patients entered the study .    2.4531079640282147
twenty - one ( 38 . 9 % ) developed postoperative delirium ( 11 mild , 2 moderate , 8 severe ) .    2.3823365995201433
patients with aortic operations developed delirium more frequently than those with non - aortic procedures ( 55 . 5 vs 22 . 2 % , n = 27 each ) .    2.736412455687945
some preexisting diseases ( hearing disturbance ) increased the probability of postoperative delirium , while age was not identified as a risk factor .    2.3613536983853365
general psychopathological and depressive disturbances increased the likelihood of postoperative delirium .    2.344730220996872
patients who had a severe intraoperative course developed postoperative delirium more frequently .    2.7003283436420156
this was not seen in the absolute time of surgery or anesthesia nor in the intraoperative development of blood pressure or intraarterial gases , which did not differ between patients with and without postoperative delirium .    2.585856739050259
more reliable parameters were an increased intraoperative need for UNK volume , intra - or postoperatively decreased hemoglobin values ( hb < 10 g / dl ) and the development of acidosis that had to be treated .    2.7156061090963117
patients with delirium had serious complications more often ( 8 / 21 = 38 . 1 % vs 6 / 33 = 18 . 2 % ) and needed intensive care treatment longer ( 2 . 7 vs 2 . 1 days , only aortic surgery 3 . 2 vs 2 . 4 days ) .    2.741778919781709
conclusions : postoperative delirium after vascular surgery is frequent .    2.4197970139731115
patients undergoing aortic surgery , with specific concomittant medical disease , psychopathological disturbances and a severe intraoperative course , are at risk of developing postoperative delirium .    2.199456155247012
this report summarizes our experiences with the subjective visual vertical ( svv ) as a clinical neuro - UNK tool .    2.4179246185208854
in the svv test , patients have to UNK a UNK light bar in an otherwise dark surrounding earth - vertical , using a remote - control .    2.2833366871038017
normal subjects in an upright position did not UNK more than 2 ° from true vertical .    2.411728981326514
this shift in svv disappeared within weeks to months , similar to the spontaneous nystagmus .    2.2381049470792402
after stapes surgery slight deviations of the svv towards the UNK ear were seen in about 20 % of the patients , indicating a slight irritation of the otolith organs .    2.423344160320979
assessed in an upright position , the svv thus may be regarded as reflecting tonic UNK input differences between the two ears .    2.5280665260364876
introduction : vocal cord paralysis is a important complication in thyroid gland surgery .    2.0640625567055455
a prospective study was conducted ascertain the frequency of laryngeal nerve palsy not caused by surgical trauma .    2.8132619200697233
patients and methods : two hundred and ten patients were investigated laryngoscopically pre - and postoperatively after short - term intubation in the course of operations far removed from thorax or neck region .    2.4233572989161236
we noted the inner diameter of the tube , intubation problems , the qualification of the anaesthesiologist and the positioning of the patient .    2.44097033363189
results : preoperatively we found previously unknown unilateral laryngeal nerve palsy in 1 . 9 % of cases .    2.601876835877185
postoperatively there were pathological findings of vocal cords in 13 patients ( 6 . 2 % ) .    2.641313706408848
in 10 patients a direct lesion ( oedema , rubor , haematoma , granuloma ) was established .    2.1433968280649176
three patients ( 1 . 4 % ) were found to have a movement disorder caused by a neural lesion without morphological findings , leading to UNK ad integrum in two of three cases after 6 months .    2.986849357832063
conclusion : the frequency of intubation - related recurrent nerve palsy is 1 . 4 % transiently and 0 . 5 % permanently .    2.958148176621493
preoperative UNK investigation of vocal cords should be carried out before intubation .    2.5989384210341613
herpes simplex virus type 1 ( hsv - 1 ) and type 2 ( hsv - 2 ) are the most frequent infections cause of genital ulcerations .    2.9132768191976455
this study was conducted on a panel of sera collected anonymously in 1996 and 1997 from blood donors ( 1979 samples ) and hospital patients ( UNK samples ) without risk factors for UNK infections such as std , other infectious diseases and immunosuppression .    2.014331519402862
serum samples were tested with UNK using monoclonal antibody - selected native UNK and UNK as antigens and an UNK using type - specific recombinant glycoproteins .    2.4798202522924826
equivocal results were confirmed with an in - house western UNK .    2.3806129749289706
this study investigates the effects of UNK , a glutamatergic modulator , and the lipid peroxidation inhibitor u - UNK on neurological outcome following incomplete cerebral ischemia and reperfusion in rats .    2.68877900796467
we report on three family members suffering from both autosomal dominant hailey - hailey disease and bipolar affective disorder .    1.8780569098381434
as molecular biology techniques have made the localization of genes causing simple mendelian traits possible as a routine task , the gene for hailey - hailey disease will presumably be localized in the UNK future .    2.2073311883626703
the hailey - hailey gene and its chromosomal surrounding will then be a region of interest for linkage studies in bipolar affective disorder .    1.94977515083922
background : osteoporotic fractures occur frequently also in men .    2.25271139280467
epidemiologic data from germany indicate that more than 900 , 000 men are affected by osteoporotic fractures .    2.0559027256383917
diagnosis and therapy of male osteoporosis are hampered by a lack of clinical studies .    2.8820721647538914
recurrent headaches and recurrent abdominal pain ( rap ) are the most common pain syndromes in childhood : the prevalence of tension headache amounts to 20 - 50 % , of migraine to 5 - 7 % and of rap to 15 - 30 % .    2.568837459758263
in nearly 50 % of children the complaints persist over many years of their life - span .    2.304164184374794
the unfavourable long - term prognosis support the indication of early and specific interventions .    2.5342746720116955
actual approaches suggest to understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance , and in this context there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial influences .    2.3041261179370784
the behavioral - medicine UNK bases upon an extensive family anamnestic exploration and symptom analysis .    1.98440759744801
the psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis ( stress inoculation , cognitive UNK , problem solving ) , reduction of pain symptoms ( relaxation , distraction , imagination ) and environmental modification ( parental reinforcement and UNK behavior ) .    1.9127032253210636
during the last years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioral pain management programs for children .    2.0481043450538583
the aim of our study was to develop noninvasive stereotactic radiotherapy for patients with choroidal metastases .    2.385647474687001
extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( eswl ) is standard therapy for urolithiasis .    2.1956855412968257
with comparable technical principles , various UNK have been developed and are in routine use .    2.6499034389325797
renal pelvic stones , UNK stones , ureteral stones , and other special forms can be treated with varying results .    2.3520507607436874
currently , the so - called clinically UNK residual fragments and the recurrence of calculi are under discussion .    2.3346072735494956
whereas the side effects of eswl are well known , studies comparing eswl with other UNK procedures are still lacking .    2.5171520603122888
suramin has long been used in the treatment of UNK and UNK .    3.6944839393664886
recent investigations showed an antiproliferative effect of suramin on prostate carcinoma cell lines .    2.2397770662424215
ongoing clinical trials have confirmed the effect of suramin on metastasizing prostate carcinoma .    2.793138165152343
five patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma resistant to classic hormonal therapy were treated with high - dose suramin .    2.906695448721234
four of the five developed a UNK or maculopapular rash within 2 - 4 weeks of starting therapy .    2.7313385629191265
the rashes disappeared after discontinuation of suramin within 10 days .    2.3570326018064836
in tumour therapy , high dosages of suramin are used to achieve a serum level of 200 - 300 µg / ml .    2.4415523543742985
therefore , a toxic reaction to suramin is suspected as the explanation for the skin rashes .    2.2868432191412187
UNK ( ace ) inhibitor - induced angioedema is supposed to be an uncommon cause for oropharyngeal edema .    2.5275291677824288
between january 1 , 1993 and february 1 , 1997 we treated 20 patients with edema of the oropharyngeal region that was not caused by infection or irradiation .    2.2933610322142273
the most common reason was an ace - inhibitor - induced angioedema and occurred in 9 cases , all of whom required inpatient treatment .    2.232621224230247
the medical management consisted of the UNK - tion of intravenous ( i . v . )    3.215437826693451
in our experience it is necessary to reconsider ace inhibitor - induced UNK in any case of an oropharyngeal edema .    2.6704204617856706
however , there is no reason for the routine application of epinephrine in these cases .    3.017653930404123
there was a disintegration rate of 98 % directly after treatment ; 1 week after " booster technique " treatment 96 % of the patients were free of stones and without any symptoms .    2.1693363953501867
the 3 - month follow - up showed a stone - free rate of 97 % .    2.6345749807822965
only in 13 % of the cases auxiliary procedures were neccessary , 7 % of them before extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( eswl ) and 6 % after eswl .    2.4283397834929046
43 % of the treatments were performed without any premedication , anaesthesia or sedoanalgesia .    2.900543258685481
our data even prove that in situ eswl is a safe and effective method for the treatment of ureteral stones .    2.707449419551024
in comparison to endoscopic procedures , it is superior in regard to invasivity , side effects , complications and UNK of analgesia , while being just as efficient .    2.9587444661807276
therefore it is recommended as first choice method in the treatment of ureteral stones .    3.044844701253745
the perspectives for active hearing implants lie in the treatment of patients with sensorineural hearing loss ( snhl ) .    2.69150233186457
the majority of patients with snhl suffer from a cochlea amplifier ( ca ) failure which is discernible by a positive recruitment and loss of otoacoustic emissions ( UNK ) .    2.1791086305282628
therefore , the electronic implant is expected to partially replace functions of the ca .    2.340893939010574
thus , the implant is thought to function as a cai ( cochlea amplifier implant ) .    2.3724769787504223
an approved implant for routine use is not yet available .    2.6770583387031404
clinical studies have thus far only used the high energy consuming ( hec ) , narrow - band , electromagnetic floating - mass transducer , as well as the UNK - hec implant .    2.29678220870815
the high UNK consuming , yet broadband UNK UNK implant is soon to be used in humans .    2.344569807923149
of the piezoelectrical implants , a german cai ( tübingen implant ) at present consisting of a piezoelectrical transducer and a microphone has thus far been acutely implanted in first patient .    1.925583156113008
it is a low energy consuming ( UNK ) , broad - band implantable system for patients with sensorineural hearing loss .    2.909854527932895
juvenile myoclonic epilepsy ( jme ) was de - scribed UNK by UNK and christian in 1957 and consists of myoclonic UNK in varying combination with the absence of seizures and generalized tonic - clonic seizures , a typical circadian distribution on awakening , sleep deprivation , alcohol consumption and UNK stimuli as characteristic precipitating factors , typical eeg abnormalities with generalized UNK discharges , normal physical and neuroradiological findings , and often a family history of epilepsy .    1.9891938845746884
although the misdiagnosis of this well - classified and easily treatable syndrome is supposed to occur rarely in germany , we retrospectively investigated how often the wrong initial classification had been made among patients who were finally treated in our outpatient epilepsy unit .    2.2089311564741405
between 1993 and 1995 , 30 patients with a typical jme - like symptom constellation were identified who had been misdiagnosed initially .    2.6621631267737267
in all patients , localization - related epilepsy had been classified , although regional eeg abnormalities were rare ( n = 5 ) .    2.33133051023087
all patients reported the typical circadian distribution , abnormal neuroradiological findings were absent , and typical eeg abnormalities were present in all cases .    2.381562161909894
under treatment with UNK antiepileptic drugs 97 % of the patients became almost completely seizure - free .    2.790056423312593
even 40 years after the first description of the syndrome , jme is an underdiagnosed illness .    2.9524620508457917
the generally positive course underlines the importance of its correct identification .    2.565376639101187
background : the aim of the study was to evaluate results of visual acuity and UNK and complications after cataract surgery with primary capsular bag - fixated iol implantation in children .    2.3194722715042086
arterial hypertension is known to be an important risk factor for cerebral and cardiovascular disease .    3.0975581743949725
previous studies have demonstrated alterations in the UNK microcirculation in patients with essential hypertension .    3.564854471028968
during follow - up a progression of these alterations has been reported .    2.781163977692522
in the present study we quantified the retinal microcirculation of patients with hypertension under different systemic antihypertensive medication .    2.444853549866748
vaginal and uterine bleeding is a common symptom in gynecology .    2.701328991834172
the cause of the bleeding should be investigated so as to exclude carcinoma as its origin .    2.500846674681892
first , the basic circulation parameters should be determined .    2.4874727516633337
depending on these findings , further diagnostic or therapeutic steps must be undertaken .    2.5422310145510503
if the situation is stable , diagnostic measures are indicated to localize the bleeding and the tumor .    2.342988724304245
a general examination , including a vaginal and rectal examination , must be performed .    2.5487650051576507
other diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound ( vaginal and transabdominal ) and ct or mri may be required .    2.4516699481046644
if available , an angiography should be performed .    2.517093308221816
medium - term results with a follow - up of at least 3 years were done in 160 patients ( average follow up 51 months ) after acl reconstruction using ikdc evaluation form and noyes score and in 110 patients ( average follow up 53 months ) after non - operative management .    2.6660324315185786
unlike objective good parameters the subjective assessment of knee function according to the noyes score reveals significantly worse results in cases with acl reconstruction compared to the knees without surgery .    2.644217180204014
the best functional results we found in professional athletes after acl reconstruction .    2.426866067923513
comparable positive results of knee function is only achieved in approx .    2.5242759690645586
in our opinion compensatory proprioceptive mechanism account for the UNK results in these two groups of patients .    2.9200554006595683
it will be postulated that it is not the absolute power of the hamstring but the latency period of UNK that influences the compensation of anterior knee instability .    2.4307424162060403
we have modified our rehabilitation methods in order to improve proprioception and dynamic stability of the acl - deficient knee .    2.6531391288004005
only when menisceal lesions appear or patients suffer from giving way episodes we support secondary surgery .    2.0108348955289785
the pivot shift sign is reflecting the dynamic aspect of knee instability .    2.1421797249319816
in our opinion it is the decisive parameter to assess knee instability unless there are useful technical UNK .    2.353241400698185
multiple injuries in elderly patients are still a common problem .    3.4153920172849994
the present study was performed to investigate mortality and complications in multiple trauma patients aged 65 years or more .    2.650647137023723
a total of UNK multiple trauma patients with an injury severity score ( iss ) of at least 18 points were divided in two age groups : y : 16 - 64 years , n = UNK ; o : 65 - 94 years , n = 132 .    2.4661177829165575
older patients were injured as pedestrians in most cases ( 69 % ) , while younger patients were more frequently injured as car and drivers passengers ( 41 % ) .    2.5483609433429804
iss was comparable in both groups ( y 28 + / - 1 , o 27 + / - 1 ) .    3.231787604708102
during icu - therapy incidence of ards ( y 10 % , o 11 % ) , multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mof ; y 6 % , o 9 % ) and pneumonia ( y 17 % , o 21 % ) were comparable .    2.9117253116301454
in contrast , septic complications were more frequent in older patients ( y 19 % , o 27 % ) .    2.5673640023858733
length of icu stay ( y 19 + / - 2 , o 18 + / - 1 ) and ventilation time ( y 14 + / - 2 , o 17 + / - 1 ) were comparable .    3.177098705150626
mortality was significantly higher in older patients ( y 15 % , o 53 % ) .    2.7831247050580514
the major cause of death was sepsis in older patients ( y 15 % , o 31 % ) and mof in younger patients ( y 54 % , o 29 % ) .    2.600002367633539
in conclusion , older trauma patients had a higher mortality due to the development of UNK complications .    3.425399528467937
the raynaud phenomenon occurs in 90 - 100 % of patients with systemic scleroderma .    3.2569165632111576
it is caused by dysregulation of the vascular tone between UNK and vasodilatory influences .    2.6323157453706574
early damage to the vascular endothelium and the activation of platelets lead to the release of vasoactive substances .    2.880894119980522
structural and function impairment of the perivascular neural fibers contributes to the vasospasm .    2.4770848183397276
new vasodilatory treatment strategies , e . g .    2.34816695888536
infusions with calcitonin gene - related peptides , could be useful in the control of vasospasm in the peripheral extremities as well as internal organs in systemic scleroderma .    2.7302133073883046
due to the limited efficacy of drug therapy in atrial fibrillation and the high rate of recurrence , strong efforts were made to find non - pharmacological strategies .    2.551479717219842
for three years now , the implantable atrial defibrillator metrix from UNK has been available as an alternative therapy .    2.398620231249119
from october 1995 to the present the atrial defibrillator was implanted in 179 patients worldwide .    2.3736511434161334
the sensitivity of the system and its algorithms to detect atrial fibrillation is 90 % ; the specifity to detect sinus rhythm is 100 % .    2.294612797423576
in 121 of 179 patients , UNK episodes of spontaneous atrial fibrillation were treated with 2 . 4 shocks per episode .    2.520967774148689
no proarrhythmic event or stroke was seen .    2.3443515249329914
a cardioversion to sinus rhythm could be achieved in 95 % of patients ; the overall clinical success rate was 88 % .    3.0277247639010834
in 7 % of all patients , early recurrence of atrial fibrillation ( UNK ) occurred that could not be converted into stable sinus rhythm after further UNK and antiarrhythmic therapy .    3.1446841901061022
in 4 . 1 % there were lead - related complications , in 4 patients the device had to be explanted because of ineffective therapy , and in 3 patients the device had to be changed because of loss of telemetry or early depletion of battery .    2.6139262054475934
in 8 patients , postoperative complications were seen ( infections , pneumothorax and thrombosis of the subclavian vein ) .    2.60273086065951
overall , the implantable atrial defibrillator metrix is an effective and safe alternative in treating atrial fibrillation .    2.46470024286089
background : the success rate of combined glaucoma and small incision cataract surgery is not yet established .    2.5347237932104094
the somatosensory system of preterms and newborns differs substantially from adults .    2.0697985077638377
these differences are of considerable preclinical and clinical interest .    2.487904619862293
maturation of a - and c - fibre synaptic connections in the dorsal horn and development of descending inhibition from the brainstem all take place postnatally in the rat .    2.143404769191744
in early stages of development there is no definite spatial UNK in the dorsal horn between the nociceptive and the non - nociceptive system .    2.881165204933362
in preterms but not in adults non - noxious stimuli can induce central sensitization .    2.1894640170852853
many neurotransmitters and UNK molecules involved in pain pathways are expressed early in the developing nervous system but do not reach adult levels for a considerable period .    2.0731216493285864
the descending pain inhibitory system that provides an important protection against central sensitization developes later than the ascending nociceptive system .    1.9975586954189564
thus , during a critical period of time the immature nociceptive system is highly vulnerable .    2.399005184912298
for example , neonatal circumcision in the absence of analgesia results in increased pain responses during subsequent routine vaccination months later .    2.174039080125556
numerous studies conducted during the past decades indicate that the public ' s attitude toward the mentally ill is strongly UNK .    2.3736089900151556
since the attitude of the general public also has an effect on community - based psychiatric care , we must ask how public opinion might be influenced .    2.2405371176964124
one possible approach could be through so - called key community leaders - those who are highly respected in society because of their competence in a particular area .    2.222974202384177
for this reason we questioned medical students , as future key community leaders , with respect to their attitudes toward the mentally ill within the framework of their first contact with psychiatric patients during their studies .    2.0969750954200554
in order to make a direct comparison possible , we interviewed a sample of the mannheim population who live in a part of the city where a variety of complementary facilities have been set up .    2.23982867861389
the comparison shows that medical students do not have a more positive attitude toward the mentally ill ; in fact , in certain areas they have an even more negative attitude toward the mentally ill than the general population has .    2.2063090146808517
we were not able to establish what effect teaching has with respect to changing attitudes .    2.338819713541671
systematic lymphadenectomy for colorectal cancer aims to remove potentially metastatic lymph nodes from the tumor ' s drainage basin .    2.1632503460114454
this requires knowledge of normal lymphatic anatomy and metastatic routes .    2.324875351829498
systematic lymphadenectomy performed as a standard or as an extended resection is a prerequisite for pathologic tumor staging .    2.52720088936754
an intensive search by the pathologist for lymph node metastases is critical for precise staging .    2.29698524494273
recommendations as to the extent of lymphadenectomy are derived from potential improvement of prognosis and procedure - related complications .    2.640064317784475
life threatening hemorrhage in patients with malignant tumours of the head and neck area are often , as a result of tumour infiltration , postoperative anatomical changes , infection and radiological necrosis , difficult to control .    2.67228083690932
one option for prophylaxis and treatment is the ligature of the external ( eca ) or common carotid artery ( cca ) and superior thyroid artery ( sta ) .    2.2917525017727676
52 patients were examined in a retrospective study to determine both the hazards and the therapeutic use of the procedure .    3.366053895964007
the external carotid artery ( eca ) was ligated prophylactically during the operative procedure of tumour resection and neck dissection in 25 patients .    2.4628757008689077
in 27 cases closure of the eca , cca or eca and sta was carried out as an emergency procedure for acute hemorrhage following completed primary treatment ( operation , primary or postoperative radiation or radiochemotherapy ) .    2.132678107127253
there was no postoperative hemorrhage after prophylactic ligature of the eca .    2.317981463927833
one patient with multiple cardiovascular diseases suffered from an ipsilateral cerebral infarction 1 year after operation .    2.4052720620259707
in 6 of 9 patients and in all 3 patients , in whom ligature of the cca or eca and sta respectively was carried out as an emergency procedure , severe neurological complications up to an UNK syndrome occured .    2.405446162780705
the number of deaths due to acute hemorrhage was considerably smaller among those patients with prophylactic ligature of the eca performed during operative procedure of tumor resection and neck dissection .    2.239630036157657
in addition there were much less unfavourable courses in the sequence of prophylactic closure of the eca than observed after UNK the cca or eca and sta in an emergency situation .    2.1566777746043804
the carcinoid tumor of the middle ear is a very rare neoplasm which in general is regarded as benign but may be mistaken for an adenocarcinoma because of its histological heterogeneity .    2.550674072581369
typical , however , is its neuroendocrine and mucinous differentiation so that an unequivocal diagnosis is possible by means of immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy .    2.7172084170651503
as the tumor is very rare , there is no statistical evidence as to whether further treatment is necessary after primary exstirpation of the tumor .    2.8050192185011804
therefore , a review of the literature was performed .    2.899170930675859
we report about a 28 - year - old male patient with a carcinoid tumor of the left tympanic cavity .    2.6770562124886803
without any further treatment there has been no evidence for either recurrence or metastases 32 months after surgical resection .    2.536447595841309
as treatment of choice we recommend conservative surgery with complete removal of the tumor and a clinical follow - up on a regular basis .    3.1317012103357595
intraoperative precision in computer - assisted surgery depends on the characteristics of a navigation system , the precision of correlation between object and data set , the position , number and fixation of landmarks , and the parameters of the data set .    2.7245964680406227
the precision of five navigation systems of different types and technology was measured : viewing UNK ( UNK , mechanical system ) , the UNK microscope ( carl zeiss , infrared system with laser autofocus ) , the UNK system ( carl zeiss , robot platform with laser autofocus ) and the UNK pointer ( UNK , infrared system ) .    2.7885814702598224
the immanent precision of these systems ranges from 0 . 1 to 2 . 0 mm .    3.3665709931423584
an electromagnetic system ( 3 - space UNK , UNK ) was compared ; this produces serious UNK deviations of 10 . 0 to 20 . 0 mm in the presence of metal , surgical and rotating instruments , and circuits .    2.7474342181410347
the application of these different systems for craniomaxillofacial surgery is discussed .    2.476724257206388
the aim of the study was to record retrospectively the events of pneumocystis carinii - pneumonia ( pcp ) among hiv - infected children ( < 18 years ) in germany .    2.1653851935880133
the patients were evaluated with regard to prophylaxis , course of disease and prognosis .    3.606440843539559
in this study we looked at the relationship between extracorporal circulation and changes in blood electrolytes .    2.581622697010895
glucocorticoids are a potent cause of osteoporosis and thus a potential source of substantial morbidity in patients who are already significantly disabled by their underlying condition .    2.250274855291708
these agent interact with calcium metabolism at many levels ; in particular they reduce the osteoblast ' s synthesis of the principal proteins of bone matrix .    1.9354657162776978
they also reduce circulating sex hormone concentrations , particularly in men and postmenopausal women .    2.2667187307487833
gastrointestinal stromal tumors ( gist ) , which form a rare group of neoplasias of the gastrointestinal tract , have not yet been fully investigated .    2.4258275601823858
although good progress has been made in their diagnosis , classification of these lesions with regard to their histogenesis and biological behavior remains problematic .    2.519953196575194
between 1994 and 1998 , 18 gist patients UNK operation in the department of surgery .    2.5412086637574927
twelve of these patients ( 67 % ) had stromal tumors in the stomach , and six ( 33 % ) had intestinal stromal tumors .    2.9553355960168846
six patients developed hematogenous liver metastasis , with the size of their primary tumor exceeding 10 cm .    2.4766057109900896
extrahepatic distant metastases were not found in any case .    3.0182062596343386
lymphadenectomy showed that lymph node metastases did not occur .    2.6713448037156518
histological evaluation was made according to the guidelines of UNK , UNK and UNK .    3.397225289953303
currently established therapy is limited to complete surgical resection of the primary tumor and its metastases .    3.1052419663108983
adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy approaches have failed .    2.4790182942773527
we report the case of a 39 - year - old UNK worker , who was admitted to our hospital with fever , jaundice , pain in his UNK and acute renal failure .    2.4016595668603915
serology revealed elevated antibody titers against UNK UNK , l . UNK and l . UNK .    2.917638395519142
the patient developed disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) with diffuse gastrointestinal bleeding due to thrombocytopenia .    2.1895705785273254
the ecg showed atrial fibrillation with irregularly irregular rhythm .    2.3315748719069815
cardiac arrest developed , most likely due to hypoxia , with a drop in the blood pressure .    2.91521391388039
despite immediate resuscitation efforts the patient developed severe hypoxic brain damage and died a few days later .    2.440411539192053
autopsy disclosed histologic signs of a generalized UNK infection , signs of shock and within the lungs a necrotizing herpes simplex virus pneumonia causing the death of the patient .    2.2514626916916254
the virus pneumonia most probably was caused by retrograde canalicular dissemination of oral secretions since herpetic UNK and esophagitis were found and herpetic lesions were readily identified on the lips and tongue .    1.8887957592901312
a medical opinion asked for by the professional association having liability for occupational safety and insurance was given , the disease being recognized as an occupational disease .    2.1280666605291447
during the past decade , the molecular mechanisms in the process of tumor progression , including metastasis and angiogenesis , have become better understood .    2.1826649900352573
cancer metastasis consists of multiple , complex interacting steps .    2.469082565068141
each of these steps is crucial and limiting , since a failure to complete any one prevents the tumor cell from producing a metastasis .    2.022867207552189
detachment from the solid tumor by loosening the intercellular junctions and proteolysis of the extracellular matrix enables tumor cells to enter blood - and lymph vessels .    1.9532332148060392
the intravasation into the circulation is supported by the secretion of angiogenic factors , which induce degradation of the basal membran in blood vessels .    2.230462500305286
adhesion to endothelial cells , extravasation from the circulation , and induction of angiogenesis are further essential steps for UNK the metastatic process .    2.2848611317688046
furthermore , it is well known that once a tumor cell has entered circulation , it will survive only by UNK of the immune system .    2.709753634828567
the systematic identification of tumor antigens opens up new possibilities for UNK approaches .    2.158103602345871
hypogonadism is the main indication for testosterone substitution in the ageing male .    2.4590548701242154
the choice of the testosterone preparation should be based on the principle that serum levels of testosterone remain in the normal range and fast termination of therapy is possible .    2.442534280784618
to date , transdermal testosterone systems appear to be best suited for substitution therapy in the ageing male .    2.252436040610318
future promising developments are testosterone gels and intramuscular testosterone undecanoate .    2.1184042950120103
any testosterone therapy in the ageing male has to be monitored closely , especially regarding erythropoiesis and the prostate .    2.518115148330278
pigmented UNK synovitis ( pvns ) is a disease that involves the lining of joints , UNK and tendon sheaths .    2.7766840513347155
the incidence is low and estimated to be 1 . 8 patients per million population .    2.6365465431140627
the cause of pvns is unclear and discussed to be either inflammatory or neoplastic .    2.2992088561495163
pvns has been described in 2 forms different for prognosis and treatment ( nodular and diffuse ) .    2.4010258229843267
the articular form almost UNK in the knee joint as we describe below in a 14 year - old patient .    2.9508222607333763
in this retrospective study , 13 patients with subtle lisfranc joint injuries were examined after a mean period of 23 months using clinical assessment , radiography and dynamic UNK gait analysis .    2.167186129571489
the aims were to identify the factors leading to a mobile flatfoot deformity , evaluate the functional and clinical outcome of these injuries , and draw practical conclusions for initial management and subsequent intervention .    2.2051623327187273
all patients showed a mobile flatfoot deformity , increased motion in the subtalar joint , increased load on the hindfoot , decreased load on the forefoot , and a prolonged contact phase during the stance phase .    2.328897619087498
radiographs revealed progressive osteoarthrosis in the joint and a residual displacement of the medial lisfranc joint .    2.6404623949920967
an unstable medial lisfranc joint results in the development of a mobile flatfoot .    3.3470903464641344
initial treatment of a UNK displaced lisfranc joint should consist of exact anatomical reduction and additional maintenance of the longitudinal arch of the foot .    2.4864881245534756
after failed initial treatment , early arthrodesis of the midfoot is recommended as a salvage procedure for the foot .    2.469162492183283
cross - sectional imaging with ct and mri plays an indispensable complementary role to endoscopy in the pretherapeutic workup and staging of laryngeal neoplasms .    2.142947000702695
adequate interpretation of the ct and mr images requires a thorough knowledge of the patterns of submucosal spread and UNK with the diagnostic signs of neoplastic invasion as seen with each modality .    2.556165347648741
in addition , the radiologist should be aware of the implications of imaging for staging and treatment .    2.1514653868405027
the high negative predictive value of both ct and mri allows exclusion of neoplastic cartilage invasion quite reliably .    2.424954287537866
the specificity of both ct and mri is , however , limited and both methods may therefore UNK the extent of tumor spread .    2.820046206253247
nevertheless , both cross - sectional imaging methods significantly improve the pretherapeutic staging accuracy of laryngeal tumors if used in addition to clinical examination and endoscopic biopsy .    2.414058101454234
background : hla - dr antigen plays a key role in transplantation immunology .    2.2292484168984537
organ culture storage leads to loss of hla - dr - positive corneal langerhans cells .    2.2757658470798847
this study investigates the importance of prolonged storage period for the success rate after penetrating keratoplasty .    2.815042506888317
ergotamine - containing drugs are widely used in the treatment of acute migraine attacks .    2.846477993401165
among others , spastic UNK are one of the possible side effects usually affecting the lower extremities and sometimes leading to gangrene .    2.545666452367645
the case of a 75 year old woman is presented who was suffering from migraine - attacks since adolescence .    2.460388212463365
due to longterm use of ergotamine containing suppositories she developed perianal ulcers .    2.029072143086867
after UNK of the drug the ulcers healed up entirely .    3.0307601300206803
the spectrum of ergotamine - induced side - effects and possible intervention strategies are discussed .    2.4981885962653654
in this article , a model of quality assurance for inpatient psychotherapy is discussed , which was developed in cooperation between researchers and clinicians .    2.5648958019551666
this model is based on the concept of internal quality assurance with external help .    3.207898771515679
the heidelberg model of active internal quality assurance has three elements : ( 1 . )    2.550711323281668
rules for evaluating the outcome of every patient and ( 3 . )    3.5943342488149503
a feedback model for communicating the results to the therapists ( quality circles ) .    2.2200031952002477
the focus of this model is the recognition of problematic results .    2.6994862563817827
it is mainly these results that will be discussed in our quality circles , where the outcome of treatments from the perspective of the inventory and of the therapists are discussed .    2.530644290702514
this feedback model and the quality circles will be explained with three examples of patients .    2.338453504876324
the heidelberg model of active internal quality assurance will be seen as the basis of a concept of quality assurance , which is aimed at UNK and improving the quality and UNK of the psychotherapeutic service .    3.0029280488943364
aims : in this study the technique of intravenous regional anesthesia ( UNK block ) was evaluated as an experimental tool to differentiate peripheral and central effects of analgesics .    2.5658460286713187
a pre - term infant weighing 900 g , gestational age 25 weeks , developed an acute abdomen .    2.266579882637572
intravenous lines had been inserted previously in the left ( UNK ) and right ( 24 g cannula ) saphenous veins in the neonatal intensive care unit .    2.442009991199562
during surgical exploration , a perforation of the terminal ileum was found .    2.42152116386359
the operation consisted in partial resection of the perforated ileum with an end - to - end anastomosis and a double - lumen colostomy .    2.336199929982246
major blood loss during the procedure caused serious haemodynamic problems .    2.635465288942339
despite transfusion of erythrocyte ( 100 ml ) , thrombocytes ( 75 ml ) , and albumin ( 50 ml ) , the patient developed bradycardia and hypotension .    3.0053676302068757
administration of atropine , adrenaline , and calcium iv had no effect .    2.1195128327823323
the operation could be finished only with UNK resuscitation .    2.4503855461491666
when the UNK were removed , livid , swollen lower limbs raised the suspicion of an acute thrombosis of the inferior vena cava .    2.574863054918359
after insertion of a 24 g iv cannula into a vein of the right upper arm , the circulation stabilised after rapid transfusion of 40 ml blood and 25 ml thrombocytes and resuscitation was successful .    2.1303233925718583
UNK and anaesthesiologists must consider the risk of thrombosis of the vena cava .    3.1818526360144728
if venous lines in the lower limbs are not visible to the anaesthesiologist during the operation , venipuncture of veins of an upper limb is recommended before starting the surgical procedure .    2.382360138905655
due to the high incidence of vena cava thrombosis caused by central venous lines and the difficulty of peripheral venipuncture in pre - UNK , a safe venous line should be inserted if necessary by pre - operative UNK .    2.483087248129875
while complementary medicine and UNK is becoming an increasingly prominent part of the health care practices , there is a lack of controlled studies concerning their effectiveness .    2.8947794037712944
in our study , we wanted to answer the question whether a combination of formica rufa d6 and UNK of the patient ' s own blood is superior to injection of placebo .    3.101362169948749
104 patients with ankylosing spondylitis entered a prospective , randomized , double - blind study .    2.3764068750914897
during four weeks they received twice weekly either 1 ml of formica rufa d6 in combination with 0 . 5 ml of blood or 1 . 5 ml nacl intramuscular .    2.7056410786665728
before and after therapy , mobility , thoracic UNK and doctor ' s overall assessment were measured in addition to patient ' s health status , using a german version of the arthritis impact measurement scales , before and after therapy as well as four , twelve , and UNK weeks later .    2.8803521885450802
we were not able to detect any statistical difference between treatment and placebo group in any of the parameters measured .    2.3650161933024245
therefore , the therapy under study may not be regarded effective .    2.495619830173486
a 32 - year - old man was accused of attempted UNK .    2.5276393621834323
while UNK at the side of the road he felt an erection .    2.748771276492127
he approached a 9 - year - old girl who happened to be coming along and pressed his penis between her legs until ejaculation .    2.003584507919279
shortly afterwards he was arrested .    2.6034013334053823
he UNK , but claimed partial amnesia and had no explanation for the offence , which he normally would never have thought of .    2.232855908547548
shortly before the event a UNK had seen him UNK in a poor state of orientation .    2.45693045885589
three months later in UNK he suffered massive subarachnoidal hemorrhage from an aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery .    2.6118365186051995
the evaluation of his legal responsibility must take account of a putative psychomotor seizure at the time of the offence .    2.4034863786002303
with regard to the aneurysm diagnosed later , a pathogenetic connection , in terms of a preceding UNK leak , might be assumed .    2.367141518736984
we present a 43 - year - old patient who has had up to 15 frontal lobe seizures UNK for 12 years .    2.2649961229026396
the patient had no complaints apart from excessive daytime sleepiness .    2.2839533414756787
neurological and psychiatric examination as well as cerebral computed tomograph and magnetic resonance imaging were normal .    2.9128448625634853
after sleep deprivation an interictal electro - UNK demonstrated a recurrent excess of UNK activity over the right frontal and UNK area .    2.0957546713304804
a cerebral pet study showed diminished glucose metabolism of the right UNK and UNK region .    3.148893193057939
the sleep structure was extremely fragmented .    2.479175634322602
there was an excessive reduction of slow - wave sleep and rem sleep .    2.2014426337288695
carbamazepine therapy produced complete seizure control lasting a few weeks , followed by return of up to 8 seizures per night .    2.3801820807721756
UNK as add on therapy diminished the UNK seizures to 1 to 3 per night .    2.17574460420691
introduction : we attempted to optimize the determination of energy expenditure and substrate utilisation in UNK infants for practical use in a tertiary care center .    2.1810734291821468
the influence of measuring conditions upon results as well as of UNK intake and food composition on substrate utilisation and growth were investigated .    2.2815446464231366
we report a UNK driver with severe soft tissue contusion of both legs who developed atypical heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) after a thrombosis prophylaxis with unfractionated heparin ; despite a thrombosis the patient showed a systemic allergic reaction to heparin in combination with elevation of thrombocytes and positive heparin - dependent antibodies .    2.026486683348723
six days after the initial trauma deep vein thrombosis of the left lower leg was diagnosed and fasciotomy was performed , preventing an imminent compartment syndrome .    2.890648677231182
another 5 days later the patient developed exanthema of the trunk and upper extremities and urticaria on his face , as well as severe headache .    2.704106287919907
his platelet count increased from 134 000 / µl to 258 000 / µl .    2.1615714878618446
after exclusion of other causes for these symptoms , a reaction to heparin - dependent antibodies ( heparin - platelet - factor 4 complex ) was demonstrated 2 days later .    2.2236097227831766
thrombosis prophylaxis was changed to hirudin ( UNK ) and elevation of thrombocytes to 445 000 / µl was noted .    2.597195768799928
shortly after rinsing of an intravenous line with less than 50 ie unfractionated heparin at day 36 after trauma the patient developed an anaphylactic shock , which could be managed with cortisone .    2.149689991158216
we suggest that in hit the thrombocytopenia may represent only one form of an allergic reaction to heparin .    2.231060536830477
the cause of the thrombembolic event is an antigen - antibody reaction to heparin taking place on the surface of the thrombocyte .    2.3327409074628953
this is similar in all forms of systemic reaction to heparin application , even though the symptoms may vary .    2.410414566014697
as thrombocytopenia may not be the main symptom of a heparin - induced antibody reaction - in our hospital only 5 of 10 patients with hit - the disease should rather be named " heparin allergy " .    2.3294499829346167
we suggest a new classification of different pattern of heparin allergy types i - iv .    2.31466886559439
the new types i and ii are similar to hit types i and ii .    2.382205636325584
type iii is the reaction of antibodies without decrease of thrombocytes , and type iv the reaction of antibodies associated with systemic allergic symptoms .    2.025244874281319
in recent years , lengthening the human mandible by distraction osteogenesis has become an accepted treatment to correct severe mandibular hypoplasia .    2.152985799638399
using intraoral unidirectional and extraoral bidirectional distraction devices we report about our experiences and results in the application of the bone distraction technique in four selected cases of syndromal disease , including various forms of mandibular hypoplastic malformations .    2.4819845692282834
the patients involved were a boy with pierre robin syndrome , a girl with unilateral facial hypoplasia in UNK ' s syndrome , a case with nager ' s syndrome , and a rare case of midline deficiency caused by partial deletion of chromosome 18 ( UNK - syndrome ) .    2.686963710475245
the distraction period lasted from 6 to 30 days and new bone formation , ranging from 6 to 28 mm , was achieved .    2.458875340538464
real leg length discrepancies may be cosmetically disturbing and lead to gait abnormalities , pelvic UNK with subsequent lumbar scoliosis as well as functional disturbances of hip , knee and ankle joint .    2.274249743059694
morbidity and mortality after reversal of hartmann ' s procedure following perforated sigmoid diverticulitis are high and the rate of intestinal restoration is low .    2.385155078202413
aim : to investigate whether laparoscopically assisted reversal of hartmann ' s procedure is technically feasible and whether the laparoscopic procedure offers any benefit to the patient .    2.1627939244303356
method : nineteen patients were investigated .    2.686614168690927
the postoperative course was followed prospectively .    2.727472843708467
all patients were UNK 9 months after surgery .    2.5457239193633368
results : laparoscopic reversal of hartmann ' s procedure was attempted in 19 patients .    2.3724947226837823
one patient did not want the laparoscopic technique .    2.536182041742787
in two cases ( 11 % ) conversion to the conventional technique was necessary ; thus , 16 patients were operated laparoscopically .    2.616613142542533
median operative time was 114 ( 65 - 180 ) min .    2.5116672889329585
with the exception of three wound infections no immediate postoperative complications were noticed .    2.278459223971887
patients ' convalescence was fast .    2.5912033722345114
first evacuation took place 3 . 3 ( 3 - 5 ) days after surgery , complete oral nutrition 3 . 6 ( 3 - 5 ) days after surgery .    3.0388189272457575
duration of postoperative hospitalisation was 7 . 5 ( 5 - 12 ) days .    3.1510118764374693
one patient developed later a clinically significant anastomotic stricture which needed endoscopic dilatation .    2.0388195397716173
conclusion : laparoscopically assisted hartmann ' s reversal is technically demanding but feasible .    2.292727376989487
postoperative morbidity is low , duration of hospitalisation short , convalescence fast .    2.4859068417235375
thus , good arguments exist for performing reversal of hartmann ' s procedures laparoscopically .    2.168999487998699
mechanical ventilation is a well - UNK strategy in intensive care medicine .    2.7269277413444977
icu trauma patients require analgesia , and sedation mostly consists of benzodiazepines and opioids with increasing doses over time .    2.128037040605168
the weaning period is complicated by the withdrawal syndrome , showing tachycardia , hypertonia , tachypnea and UNK .    2.145319190507702
although treatment with clonidine can influence these symptoms , tachypnea still remains the main problem in weaning patients from mechanical ventilation .    2.2260423510866576
adding sufentanil , an opioid with greater effects on analgesia than on respiratory depression compared with fentanyl , tachypnea can be reduced to normal frequency .    2.1420272787253802
in this way weaning management can be managed more easily for the benefit of both , the patient and physician .    2.923509405340572
in comparison with a group of 50 patients treated with clonidine alone , 72 patients treated with clonidine / sufentanil showed a shorter period from the start of spontaneous ventilation until extubation ( 4 . 8 vs 7 . 6 days ) and until discharge from the icu ( 7 . 7 vs 12 . 4 days ) .    2.5679949752560836
the number of UNK caused by respiratory exhaustion decreased from 16 . 0 to 2 . 8 % .    2.8244804688485536
background : with regard to penetrating keratoplasty methods to culture corneal donor tissues , microsurgical techniques , hla typing and understanding of basic mechanisms in inflammation and especially graft rejection , and postoperative treatment UNK have been improved in recent years .    2.1715398649008835
this now enables successful penetrating keratoplasty in many more patients than previously performed .    2.111417277832951
however , in rare cases relevant problems in wound closure may appear .    2.3129544154560766
the occurrence of a new influenza virus subtype in 1997 in UNK caused only minor UNK due to the UNK and determined actions of the institutions involved .    2.782982853862004
however , this incident again made it clear that an influenza pandemic is still a pending threat .    2.1683631105253363
as a result the who presented a pandemic preparedness plan which is to facilitate the global measures taken to UNK an imminent or ongoing pandemic .    2.0240907246614412
strong efforts of influenza surveillance and the coordination of worldwide measures are essential to this plan .    2.21971644770743
furthermore the who suggested the developement and introduction of similar national preparedness plans .    2.0671221690912884
given the high mortality of severe sepsis and septic shock , immunomodulation has been considered as an attractive adjunct therapy .    2.3114028597074405
many agents have been studied that have the therapeutic potential to interfere with cytokines and other pathways which are activated during sepsis .    2.107686101305462
drugs having the properties to neutralize UNK have also been considered .    2.4105911829663493
so far all the large clinical trials with immunomodulating agents ( UNK , UNK , anti tnf antibodies , UNK ) have been shown to be of marginal or of no benefit .    3.09574393211608
in certain trials results were UNK , or mortality was increased which led to discontinue the studies .    2.3406681175902246
in certain other trials , like those on antibodies against tnf , some positive effects were seen in subcategories of patients .    2.187533673182382
thus , new trials are on their ways .    2.3998100294796223
so far the results of early trials has forced investigators to re - examine the concept of immunomodulation , and to UNK strategies to optimally use agents in a way that benefits the host , while not putting him at risk .    2.293815834254479
recently , percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy ( pdt ) has become more frequent , since the technique can be UNK relatively easily .    2.7536458184899977
pdt is neither time - consuming nor does it require much personell or material .    2.1424700257263507
recently , two new halogenated volatile anaesthetics , sevoflurane and desflurane , have been approved for clinical use in germany .    2.4900753088548124
their low solubility in blood is the most important common property , and this represents the most obvious difference from the inhalational anaesthetics currently used .    2.458890628560954
extensive clinical and experimental evaluations have confirmed the superior pharmacokinetic properties predicted .    2.3497077684471215
both sevoflurane and desflurane provide more rapid emergence from anaesthesia , permit easier titration of the anaesthetic dose during maintenance and offer more rapid recovery from anaesthesia .    1.8871303659468583
for sevoflurane , there are additional advantages : a pleasant odor , negligible airway irritation , and excellent pharmacodynamic characteristics that even provide cardiovascular stability comparable to isoflurane .    1.9585846407584513
a certain disadvantage and source of potential nephrotoxicity result from the metabolism of sevoflurane ( 2 - 5 % ) to UNK fluoride and degradation to compound a in carbon dioxide absorbents .    2.3940125794533285
the extensive clinical data reported to date have revealed no evidence that sevoflurane has adverse renal effects .    2.390796329317925
new insight into the pathomechanism of nephrotoxicity associated with either production of fluoride or compound a may well support clinical experience .    2.0476270220706088
desflurane strongly UNK in vivo metabolism and because of this it appears to be devoid of toxicity .    2.565679101640033
nevertheless , potential side - effects may result from degradation in dry absorbents and subsequent release of co , from its extreme UNK and irritating airway effects .    2.028617321961713
thus , desflurane is not recommended for induction of anaesthesia , especially in children .    3.0628122263992323
the tendency for desflurane transiently to stimulate sympathetic activity , especially at concentrations above 1 . 0 mac , limits its application in patients with cardiac disease .    2.531347126642611
the doctor in charge , who is generally the medical director , is liable if patients suffer harm through organizational UNK within his or her department .    1.9957737498886259
even the suspicion that an error has arisen as the result of defective organization is enough for the person responsible - that is to say the medical director - to be liable .    2.0361024432316706
for this reason , the doctor in charge must be in a position to recognize structural defects in organization and to correct these by means of staff training .    2.2324040594733603
every training measure must guarantee specialist standards ; this means that the work of doctors with no specialist training and those still in training and working under supervision is guaranteed to be of the same standard and performed with the same degree of meticulous care as that of a qualified specialist .    2.194202929779856
a legally valid consent from the patient and documentation of the patient information must be accessible at all times .    2.782888486427384
operations carried out by doctors in training must be supervised by a qualified specialist ; otherwise the doctor in charge is guilty of a defect in organization .    2.120998348511081
because of staff shortages it often happens that UNK UNK - often doctors doing their practical training - are on call very early on .    2.0227048399366345
in the high - risk specialty of obstetrics it is particularly important that doctors still undergoing practical training can call on an experienced colleague for help at all times .    2.0815305243896605
the UNK from day duty to emergency duty must be organized by the doctor in charge in such a way that the medical staff are UNK and that adequate free time is guaranteed .    2.1626395190020142
there must be no friction when cooperation with other disciplines concerned is needed .    2.139634069755232
each sector must know its own area of responsibility .    2.2364036514792556
the doctor in charge is UNK for seeing that his or her staff members are familiar with the use of the medical equipment .    2.555268331678707
uniform guidelines will make it possible for the medical director to train his / her staff and prevent systematic organizational defects .    2.15354347555792
georg friedrich stromeyer ( UNK - UNK ) is generally known as one of the founders of orthopedics and orthopedic surgery and also made many contributions to modern military medicine .    2.556721544468661
furthermore , every oral and maxillofacial surgeon in germany knows him because of the " stromeyer hook " , which is used for elevation of zygomatic arch fractures .    2.780531258402076
this special aspect as well as stromeyer ' s biography is presented in this article from the history of medicine .    2.759004673848503
changes in clinical presentation of crohn ' s disease ( cd ) , patients ' age at the time of disease manifestation and operation , general condition and duration of medical management were investigated in a retrospective study .    2.6791102100844264
UNK operations for cd were divided into consecutive groups and analysed .    2.4326674298028426
in an increasing number of cases patients presented with the " UNK type " rather than the " UNK type " of complaints .    3.0497900098187913
the duration of disease and of medical management increased .    2.926504633418876
patients in later groups were younger and in better general condition .    2.208118811374082
we found a rise in frequency of patients with recurrent cd or prior abdominal surgery for other reasons .    2.5630546953852913
primary surgery for cd increasingly consisted of resection of solitary segments of gut ; in the case of recurrence , of multiple , minimal resections .    2.470073948469334
the average total length of the resected intestine could be significantly reduced .    2.6240002512170313
the complication rate was equal in elective and emergency surgery .    2.2810327320447032
even among the uncommon aneurysms of the visceral arteries the aneurysm of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery is considered a rarity .    2.450633102594809
etiologically , numerous factors must be taken into account , the most significant one being arteriosclerosis .    2.6598620792276293
the clinical presentation is unspecific and ambiguous .    2.553828202569073
ct and , above all , intra - arterial dsa allow for a diagnosis .    2.4867595654399106
a generous consideration of indicating operative intervention , even in asymptomatic patients , is especially justified because of the imminent risk of rupture .    2.518428186684369
the UNK therapy consists of elimination of the aneurysm either conventionally by proximal and distal ligature of the pancreaticoduodenalis artery or UNK by embolization .    2.362596609219007
in the future a treatment with coated stents ( UNK ) would also seem possible .    2.8568408901641176
special attention must be paid to concomitant occlusive disease in other visceral arteries since measures for vessel reconstruction may be required because of intraoperative impairment of the collateral circulation .    2.143958335643223
we report on the rupture of an aneurysm of the UNK inferior artery in association with celiac axis occlusion .    2.9147883118121514
background : clinical courses of eight patients with urea cycle disorders ( deficiencies of UNK - synthetase ( 4 ) , argininosuccinate - synthetase ( 2 ) and argininosuccinate - UNK ( 2 ) ) are described .    2.825335301170924
methods / therapy : emergency treatment consisted of benzoate and arginine i . v . as well as peritoneal dialysis and / or modified hemodialysis .    2.564286811728766
chronic treatment comprised a low - protein diet and substitution of essential amino acids , of benzoate or phenylbutyrate and of branched - chain amino acids .    1.96481179558413
results : within 72 hours after birth hyperammonemic coma with cerebral edema developed , leading to developmental retardation later in life .    2.0406339657436154
four patients died between 2 weeks and 4 years of age .    2.749495772041613
during follow - up , all patients suffered hyperammonemic derangements treated conservatively .    2.574893583593919
phenylbutyrate had less gastrointestinal side - effects than benzoate , branched - chain amino acids had favourable effects .    2.0933385301433223
one patient was treated conservatively since birth followed by a normal development .    2.7659460642062124
conclusions : neonatal respiratory distress with alkalosis and rapid global deterioration should raise the suspicion of a urea cycle disorder .    1.9966447190974923
specific therapy as described can be life - saving , although most children exhibit marked developmental delay .    2.186172469050678
sodium phenylbutyrate has fewer side - effects than sodium benzoate .    2.562833169589724
therapy prior to cerebral edema can prevent complications .    2.4703486506483667
pronounced osteoporosis of and surrounding the acetabulum commonly leads to early loosening of endoprosthetic hip replacements following implantation .    1.9886189032268964
large osseous defects in the UNK bed are the result and the reason why multiple revisions of UNK acetabular cups have to be performed so often in rheumatic surgery .    2.5649376886676687
the defects extend from the cranial to the central ; ventral and dorsal anchorage losses may occur in addition to this .    2.4582148250765186
the new implant must be selected in accordance with point of surgical access , the patient ' s general status and osseous UNK .    2.5314979461189964
in the optimum case , osseous buildup of lost anatomical structures is the preferred method .    2.044954551688733
if this is not possible , special implants , mostly custom - made prostheses , have to be incorporated .    2.8326146942061654
however , the survival time of the implants is much shorter than in patients with degenerative diseases .    3.3034120745358875
in patients with progressive muscular dystrophy ( pmd ) invasive electrophysiologic studies can detect hidden intracardiac conduction disturbances .    2.090522353659327
the aim of this study was a long - term follow - up of these patients .    2.7206934117684716
twelve consecutive patients ( UNK , UNK , age 28 + / - 4 yrs ) without cardiac symptoms and with normal echocardiographic findings were included in the study .    2.968806948949541
they suffered from different stages of pmd type erb ( n = 4 ) , UNK - UNK ( n = 4 ) , UNK ( n = 2 ) and UNK - UNK ( n = 2 ) .    4.264816185813937
the follow - up of 5 . 5 yrs included regular clinical visits , ecgs , and holter recordings ( every 3 months ) as well as an echocardiography every 6 months .    2.2973801108242466
in 4 patients the eps revealed a hidden interatrial conduction disturbance ( UNK - acs 120 + / - UNK ) , and in 10 pts an infrahisian conduction disturbance was found ( UNK max .    2.8806612283021513
conduction defects were seen independently from the type of pmd and the stage of the disease .    2.51858068469767
during the follow - up the initially hidden interatrial conduction disturbance became evident in the surface ecg in 2 of 4 pts .    2.349225406795704
one of them developed paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .    2.5148573844379345
five of 10 pts with an initially hidden infrahisian conduction disturbance developed an av block grade i - iii and in one case additionally a bundle branch block .    2.29594070181849
none of the pts with normal findings at the eps showed abnormal p - waves , an av block , or an UNK conduction disturbance during the follow - up .    2.0705300421408546
therefore a regular cardiological screening including an ecg and a holter recording is reasonable in these patients .    2.0365209198368706
accidental hypothermia is defined as an unintentional decline in the core temperature below 35 °c and is caused by exposure to cold , drugs , endocrine dysfunction , central nervous system disorders , skin disorders , and trauma .    2.186565925157335
depending on the degree of hypothermia , there is a progressive depression of metabolism in each organ system with specific alterations .    2.612631303432692
bone is among the most common sites of metastatic disease in cancers of the breast , prostate , and lung .    2.558643869590548
the decision about systemic therapy depends on the histology , presence and extent of UNK disease , and the performance status of the patient .    3.3711371873112883
for patients with estrogen - receptor - positive breast cancer or prostate cancer , hormonal treatment represents the treatment of choice .    2.500885601974704
in estrogen - receptor - negative breast cancer , and for patients who have failed hormonal therapy or have liver metastases , chemotherapy should be initiated .    2.6255974995578013
all patients with small - cell lung cancer should receive chemotherapy .    2.542688472799512
bone metastases of differentiated thyroid cancers can be treated with UNK .    2.7591295979037067
in non - small - cell lung cancer or renal cell cancer , systemic chemotherapy should be confined to younger patients and patients in good general condition .    2.4256109306829186
radiologic assessment of responses of skeletal metastases to systemic therapy is often difficult .    2.5582079468233294
new approaches in measuring bone metabolites in urine might prove helpful .    2.3376375590543272
although most prenatally diagnosed anatomic malformations are best managed after birth , we can presently offer prenatal therapy to an increasing number of fetuses with simple anatomical defects that have predictably devastating developmental consequences .    1.9489406718035729
a condition amenable to prenatal intervention must fulfill a number of conditions .    2.5126092233722948
it must be severe enough to warrant the risks associated with in utero treatment and must be reliably detectable before birth .    2.1423568527236827
furthermore , the pathophysiology must be reversible by fetal intervention , significantly improving the prognosis over postnatal treatment .    1.980693697497984
current indication for prenatal intervention include decompression for obstructive UNK , temporary tracheal occlusion for congenital diaphragmatic hernia , and tumor debulking for congenital cystic UNK malformation of the lung and UNK teratoma .    2.0713998513424348
prenatal repair of myelomeningocele is currently being developed but remains controversial since this is not a lethal malformation .    2.4269796279691587
maternal safety remains paramount in considering fetal intervention .    2.2579259852359295
the main associated risks are pre - term labor and preterm premature rupture of membranes .    2.170377934169618
to reduce maternal morbidity and the risk of prematurity , minimally invasive UNK techniques were developed and are increasingly employed .    2.58913432093781
these developments will in all probability reduce the importance of open fetal surgery in the future .    2.6878603652093784
UNK - resistant s . aureus ( mrsa ) has become an important cause of severe infection in hospitalized patients all over the world .    2.466345101385839
in germany a significant increase of nosocomial infections due to mrsa has occurred during the last 10 years .    2.6328407059278733
especially elderly patients with chronic illnesses are at increased risk of becoming UNK or infected with mrsa .    2.744916611899898
this report focuses on epidemiology and therapy of mrsa , and on the recommendations concerning management and prevention of spread of mrsa in hospitals and nursing homes .    2.4250026005350813
during general anaesthesia gas UNK significantly is improved by performance of low flow techniques .    2.296633735473839
the objective of this prospective study was to investigate 1 . how anaesthetic gas climatisation during minimal flow anaesthesia is influenced by the technical design of different breathing hose systems in clinical practice .    2.2134639086512533
2 . to investigate , whether a sufficient gas climatisation also can be gained with higher fresh gas flows if that hose system is used , proven beforehand to optimally UNK and UNK the anaesthetic gases .    2.2191288934615105
introduction : undifferentiated , embryonal sarcoma is a rare malignant tumour of the liver , the incidence of which is highest in children between 6 and 10 years of age ( 14 . 1 % ) .    2.9673029623767158
among the primary tumours of the liver in childhood it ranks in third place after hepatocellular carcinoma and focal nodular hyperplasia .    2.2182558656369253
embryonal sarcoma is much rarer in adults .    2.6180615046022444
to our knowledge , only 18 cases have been published in the last 50 years .    2.9997253944069504
methods and results : we now present the case of a 29 - year - old woman with spontaneous rupture of the liver caused by an undifferentiated sarcoma .    2.9426521467798303
conclusion : this case report illustrates the possibility of an embryonal sarcoma being the reason for spontaneous rupture of the liver .    2.9088914099441543
the management of this case comprised primary tamponade , interventional embolisation of the feeding artery , and secondary resection under stable conditions .    2.2789394435430492
substance dependency is one of the most frequent disorders , which can be treated successfully by psychotherapy .    3.1606699068817146
however reasons are discussed , why psychotherapists probably hesitate in treating these patients .    2.3381604580400634
insufficient psychotherapeutic education concerning dependency , structural problems , expected difficulties with these patients or expected poor treatment outcome may be overcome as well as blind areas in UNK ' perception concerning dependency among their patients and themselves .    2.0561275796808824
though psychotherapy with addicts is sometimes UNK , the readiness of psychotherapists to treat patients with substance disorders is increasing .    2.3428007865914497
readiness for change and motivation for treatment are basic objects of psychotherapy in these patients .    2.436061426364488
therapeutic approaches to deal with this promising aspect of psychotherapy are presented .    2.3823134707827887
they are based on an empathic and clear therapeutic attitude .    2.762755726516539
they can be easily implemented in different settings .    2.6850008939491534
at the end of the first part of this review in - patient and outpatient settings for the treatment of substance disorders are outlined .    2.880517274414637
this will be followed in the second part by an outline of different specific psychotherapeutic approaches .    2.4693851221304937
the following experimental study was conducted to develop biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in fractures of the distal radius and to evaluate their stability .    2.5744270585856763
a model of dorsal wedge osteotomy in the distal radial metaphysis was used to develop the surgical technique and to test the stability of the alternative methods of osteosynthesis .    2.6638531631287923
the concept for this model was based on commercially available materials which were either biodegradable or osteoconductive .    2.1962417094676536
four different forms of biocompatible osteosynthesis were compared to combined kirschner wire osteosynthesis ( kwo ) , our preferred method of treatment of unstable colles fracture .    2.4462601366788097
in conclusion , injection osteosynthesis exceeded the other biocompatible methods of osteosynthesis in all respects .    2.0758610408820584
regarding the recent developments in UNK materials for osteosynthesis it offers the best perspective for clinical application .    2.2437229913386636
the " pain in the lower limbs " ( growing pain ) represent one of the most frequent complaint pictures in the child orthopaedic consulting hour .    2.493417688258061
the delimitation compared to other diseases is difficult and UNK on account of many differential diagnoses .    2.5701478525399644
UNK of our investigations was it to set up a standardized investigation UNK with recording all differential diagnoses .    2.0254319353758623
in psychotherapy with patients who do not tolerate the conditions of the ' talking cure ' because they tend to act instead of UNK their experiences interactive UNK are rather common .    2.104700858642106
often this is a consequence of nonverbal gestural behavior that directs interaction in the therapeutic dialogue while the exchange of words has taken a back seat .    2.162974110283172
the symbolic space of verbal understanding gets lost then .    2.1621598762980785
gestural behavior does not form an independent communication system as usage of ' body language ' suggests .    1.95834554047593
instead as permanent concomitant of UNK it has primarily the function of regulating the interaction of patient and psychotherapist .    2.308058927976761
the surgical treatment of UNK veins demands complete exclusion of the primary UNK circuit .    2.9717680364584873
the diagnosis is made on the basis of the clinical and ultrasound symptoms , on i . e .    2.87694582315905
if there is saphenous vein agreement between them , phlebography will yield no additional information concerning the strategy for operation .    2.1050989976455283
the prospective comparative examination of non - invasive diagnostic methods versus phlebography shows different results in 12 % of cases for the great saphenous vein and in 3 % for the small with a correction of the operative procedure .    2.891209014898422
in 10 cases of incomplete trunk varicosis , only one diagnosis was correct with non - invasive measures .    2.6336473743541373
this leads to the conclusion that phlebography should be done at the time of the preoperative examination if there are differences between the clinical and ultrasound symptoms .    3.1441443007953582
UNK odontoid fractures may lead on the basis of conventional x - rays only to a wrong conclusion with regard to biomechanical aspect of stability .    2.553661063579985
in this aspect the classification based on UNK and d ' UNK takes a high risk to UNK the fracture stability and can results in a secondary fracture dislocation .    2.7119987782695207
therefore it is important to make the decision about operative versus nonoperative treatment on the base of the trauma mechanism .    2.580698593009563
in this case report we elucidate this problem and the higher risk of anterior approach for correction .    2.411075755589628
furthermore a better classification of UNK will be recommended .    2.8198756124781665
in a period of 4 years between march 1994 and march 1998 , 143 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease ( UNK ) underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery .    2.6607857992478037
according to UNK studies 76 patients had a short - floppy nissen fundoplication , patients with impaired motility or UNK hernias received a UNK ( toupet = 42 , dor / thal = 25 ) .    2.312195435473661
recurrent reflux symptoms appeared in 6 , 3 % after mean 16 , 7 months follow - up ( nissen = 2 . 6 % , toupet = 2 . 3 % , dor / thal = 24 % , p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.4336630472089227
persistent dysphagia with reoperation occurred in 2 . 1 % ( nissen = 2 . 6 % , toupet = 2 . 3 % , dor / thal = 0 % , n . s . ) .    2.557444019554992
the assessment of visick ' s score at the latest control showed the following : visick i = 63 . 6 % , visick ii = 30 . 1 % , visick iii = 6 . 3 % , visick iv = 0 % .    2.601030399932061
the outcome of the operation was rated " excellent " or " good " by 91 . 6 % of the patients .    2.9003268125304738
in contrast to auditory brainstem potentials ( abr ) , a more UNK defined generation of middle latency evoked potentials ( mlr ) can be assumed due to the longer integration time present .    2.7054836862393805
to date , the effect of stimulus frequency spectra on mlr has not been completely known .    2.555784191460796
by using masking with high - pass UNK white noise in 12 normal - hearing adults , we measured the dependence of amplitude and latency of abr and mlr on filter frequency .    2.017043041934662
no differences were found between the masking effects for abr and mlr evoked by tone bursts of 0 . 5 and 2 khz .    2.548463819312115
the high - pass masking of click stimuli showed a greater influence on the amplitude and latency of the abr than on mlr .    2.381132218816128
our findings show that mlr evoked by tone bursts should be used for the frequency selective diagnosis of hearing thresholds , especially in low - frequency ranges .    2.557537749765251
objectives : to clarify the incidence of sudden UNK death and associated risk factors in patients after orthotopic heart transplantation ( htx ) .    2.5608805959003766
background : some reports indicate a significant rate of sudden death in heart transplant recipients limiting long - term success of the operation .    2.633222255030316
incidence , underlying risk factors , etiologies , and methods for prediction or prevention of sudden death are poorly defined .    2.331016897131734
methods : retrospective analysis of our cohort of 120 cardiac allograft recipients surviving the perioperative phase out of a total of UNK patients of the years 1984 - 1999 .    2.575630345522471
clinical events ( death , mode of death , re - htx , resuscitation ) were noted and analyzed by the kaplan - meier method and related to the patients ' characteristics by multivariate analysis .    2.3839790757115313
sudden death in or out of hospital was defined as death within one hour of symptoms or UNK death .    2.510425405417191
clinical and postmortem findings ( autopsies are available in 12 / 18 sudden death patients ) were correlated to the mode of death .    2.3821758435328015
results : during a mean follow - up interval of 4 . 6 + / - 3 . 5 years , 45 patients died ( 38 % ) .    3.0397364957263675
the mode of death was non - sudden in 27 inpatients .    2.656688640513258
18 deaths were sudden , 14 of these out of hospital .    2.365882433291412
in addition there were three cardiac arrests with successful resuscitations , one of those patients died three month later suddenly , giving a number of a total of 21 cardiac arrests in UNK patients .    2.4593429083721587
the actuarial risk of cardiac arrest was 20 % after 6 and 40 % after 12 years .    2.5280539985356483
based on postmortem analysis the etiologies of the events were attributed to transplant vasculopathy in 15 patients , rejection in 5 patients ( international society for heart and lung transplantation grade > UNK ) , and to unknown reasons in one .    2.3107632063167367
all three patients successfully resuscitated from cardiac arrest had documented UNK events ( UNK av block , UNK arrest ) .    2.048631438992582
pacemakers were implanted in these patients .    2.84410160327494
qrs width and pr interval were significantly broadened in patients with transplant vasculopathy and cardiac arrest .    2.5392594515745817
in three cases , a decrease in heart rate variability , the occurence of sustained vt , and st segment depressions prior to the cardiac arrest could be demonstrated .    2.630326850834627
conclusions : sudden death occurs at a substantial rate after htx .    2.2338079340802004
in our patients about 75 % of the arrests can be attributed to graft - vasculopathy and one quarter to acute rejection .    2.4526954376818795
diagnostic strategies have to be developed to detect patients at risk .    2.9677943548039227
interestingly , some events may be caused from UNK rhythm disturbances .    2.429131101919101
introduction : traumatic dislocation is the most severe ligamentous injury of the knee .    3.0355379361245114
methods and results : from 1974 to 1994 , 38 patients with documented knee dislocation were treated operatively in our department .    2.191319065227132
thirty - four of these patients were followed up for 3 - 16 years ( mean : 8 . 6 years ) .    3.1699477908966336
in 29 cases of the follow - up group , reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments was performed .    2.7030001579824745
in the remaining cases the cruciate ligaments were left alone .    2.4871708821961787
at the time of follow - up , 90 % of the patients showed good knee stability , but 90 % had lack of motion as well .    2.6676273500506267
post - traumatic osteoarthritis was mostly mild to moderate .    2.576751187269395
thirty - five UNK of the patients achieved excellent to good results in the lysholm score .    3.393892207111742
conclusions : positive prognostic factors were an age less than 40 years at the time of the accident , a low - energy trauma , e . g . , a sports - related injury , early reconstruction of both cruciate ligaments , and initial postoperative functional treatment .    2.326860952639735
huntington ' s disease ( hd ) is member of a growing family of neurodegenerative diseases which are caused by a cag - triplet expansion in the coding region of their respective genes .    2.157139796669936
the results of the research of the last years is very suggestive of a common pathomechanisms of all these diseases even though their clinical appearance may be quite different .    2.2558866739329138
the development of new animal models by transferring the human gene defect into the mouse genome has led to the finding of so - called UNK inclusion bodies .    2.303274130991079
this new observation allowed to come closer to solving the problem how this genetic defect causes UNK .    1.9827029418121673
recent studies on transgenic hd mice could also demonstrate a possible connection between the genetic defect and glutamate UNK in the neurodegenerative process of hd which had been emphasized by earlier animal models of the disease .    2.2220027320537468
transgenic animal models of hd will have an important impact on the understanding of the disease mechanisms and may contribute to a faster development and testing of new therapeutic approaches .    2.9723173721276988
background : the whipple operation ( pd ) is the standard operation in patients with cancer of the head of the pancreas and the periampullary region .    3.224072765666205
however , the pylorus - preserving duodenopancreatectomy ( pppd ) is supposed to be superior in gastrointestinal function .    2.234831701796851
methods : in a prospective randomized trial ( october 1994 - october 1998 ) pd and pppd were compared in terms of global and gastrointestinal quality of life , operation time , duration of hospital stay , transfusions and perioperative morbidity .    2.42856404317288
quality of life was analyzed under standardized conditions ( eortc - qlq - 30 ) pre - and postoperatively ( weeks 2 , 6 , 12 , 24 , 36 , 48 , and 60 ) .    2.1801807829365845
results : a duodenopancreatectomy was performed in 48 patients because of cancer of the head of the pancreas ( n = 38 ) and the periampullary region ( n = 10 ) ( pd , n = 24 ; pppd , n = 24 ) .    3.0188531720892193
the pd and pppd groups did not differ according to age , gender or uicc stage .    2.5214373553727327
operation time was shorter in the pppd group ( 206 + / - 48 vs UNK + / - 54 min ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.5945267095290414
morbidity did not differ between the two groups ( pppd 20 % vs pd 30 % , p > 0 . 05 ) .    2.5400555385470924
while there was no difference in global quality of life , gastrointestinal quality of life was postoperatively increased in the pppd group regarding appetite , nausea and diarrhea ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.419099236022516
while the preoperative body weight was reached after 6 months in 85 % of the pppd group ( n = 20 ) , this was true in only 60 % of the pd - group ( n = 14 ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.8086913034253334
conclusion : pppd seems to be associated with a better postoperative gastrointestinal quality of life than pd .    3.035834142615593
oxygen uptake ( v . o2 ) and carbon dioxide elimination ( v . co2 ) can be measured with an indirect UNK ; this method is well established in routine monitoring of icu patients to evaluate metabolic state as a reflection of stress .    2.46286553116086
in various experimental studies it was demonstrated that anaesthetics can influence whole - body metabolism .    2.2319402535409973
the purpose of this study was to examine whether indirect calorimetry can be used intraoperatively during routine anaesthesia and whether presumable changes in metabolism can be detected immediately .    2.2294888952113188
abdominal aortic cross - clamping changes circulation , nutritional supply of the lower extremities and thus v . o2 and v . co2 .    2.584018980776558
we therefore used this operation for our study .    2.4145570691434735
for certain indications , anterior fusion of the lumbar spine is a standard operation .    2.917265697122355
the surgeon UNK in operations on the vertebral column must UNK to utilize the advantages of laparoscopic surgery .    2.4571531402982387
however , an absolute must before applying the technique to humans is adequate training in its use in living animals .    2.0892129168990095
for this purpose , the pig is a highly suitable model .    2.3349207387910966
the surgical team comprises a surgeon experienced in spinal procedures , an abdominal surgeon with expertise in laparoscopic surgery and an experienced UNK .    2.1819841972224894
in the animal model , a change in position - organ preparation from the cranial direction , a UNK approach to the UNK - has proved UNK .    2.913483626606288
operational interventions can be planned and simulated accurately with the help of a three - dimensional reconstruction of the anatomical bone structures , created from the tomographic data of a patient .    2.5346594909245534
computer - assisted navigation systems or robotic systems can assist the intraoperative realization of the planned intervention and may support the spatial orientation within the operational field .    1.979830656179423
the desmoplastic type of the squamous cell carcinoma ( dscc ) of the skin is an entity which is readily distinguished by light microscopy .    2.7977019232195257
the dscc has fine branches surrounded by a desmoplastic stroma and shows in some cases typical perineural , perivascular and widespread intradermal invasion ( maximum 6 cm ! ) .    1.9091554280976764
this type accounts for 8 . 2 % ( n = 44 ) of our collective of UNK squamous cell carcinomas ( scc ) of the skin and UNK border .    2.8845870185972737
clinically dscc look like other malignant epithelial tumors of the skin .    2.8213858365031537
all tumors were followed up for at least 3 years ( maximum 10 years ) .    2.545167888960488
the local recurrence rate was high ( 24 . 3 % ) even though micrographic surgery was carried out .    2.843801534042167
the rate of local or regional metastasis was also very high ( 22 . 7 % ) .    2.482567035848028
in comparison the recurrence rate and the rate of UNK of the remaining common 91 . 8 % scc ' s ( n = 550 ) was low : 2 . 6 % and 3 . 8 % , respectively .    3.545995849353004
the dscc seems to be identical with the so called UNK scc , the fine UNK scc or the scc with perineural invasion which have a high rate of local recurrence and metastasis as well , but dscc is a better UNK histopathologic term for the entire group .    2.1817715362724814
the dscc is best treated with micrographic surgery and wider safety margins than any other type and should be followed up very frequently .    2.258677856781306
in the final stage of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) the majority of patients develop chronic respiratory failure due to respiratory muscle weakness .    2.2326940165734146
the interaction between the patient with als and the physician should be characterized by continuous communication , especially with respect to the prospect of ventilatory failure and for support .    2.6266849191626274
already in the early stage of the disease coping strategies should be discussed so that imminent respiratory emergencies can be handled .    2.739638650352115
if als patients are not informed about the acute respiratory insufficiency they run the risk of having to be intubated and mechanically ventilated over a long term .    2.5004369715998993
background : the advent of UNK ct ( mdct ) constitutes a UNK leap creating a wealth of new opportunities in medical imaging .    2.003027441354601
however , while the basic principles of spiral ct still apply , we are now challenged to UNK our strategies in planning a ct study to take full advantage of the increased capabilities of mdct .    2.250380823155314
extracorporeal UNK ( ecp ) , a therapeutic modality that has been under investigation for some years , is based on separation of a leucocyte / lymphocyte - enriched cell fraction from the peripheral blood , extracorporeal treatment of the cells with 8 - mop / uva and subsequent UNK of the cells in the patient .    2.7068640134999002
the immune response of the host is obviously stimulated by this treatment .    2.4023386501742126
ecp is normally performed for 4 h per day on 2 consecutive days every 4 weeks .    2.255299028623739
the treatment is well tolerated and causes few side effects .    2.2877092565037564
in our department , UNK ecp treatments were administered to 41 patients between 1990 and 1994 and a preliminary evaluation was performed .    2.274850648419379
these patients included 21 with cutaneous t - cell lymphoma ( ctcl ) , 10 with progressive systemic scleroderma , 4 with chronic graft - versus - host disease and 1 each with pemphigus vulgaris , epidermolysis bullosa UNK , lupus erythematosus and cutaneous UNK .    1.840236494651608
patients with UNK and preserved UNK achieved the best responses of all patients with ctcl .    3.0429137869526692
a treatment combining ecp with UNK - , puva and / or radiation was also successful in patients with tumour - stage ctcl and lymph node involvement .    2.8571436029052406
progressive systemic scleroderma responded in more than 50 % of our cases .    2.9219497420978455
treatment results were impressive in 4 patients with chronic graft - versus - host disease presenting with UNK and lichenoid changes of the skin and mucous membranes .    2.8202950183971414
a clear improvement was also observed in the patient with pemphigus vulgaris refractory to standard therapies and in another patient with UNK ( UNK - gottron syndrome ) .    3.158522396614744
the effectiveness of ecp seems to be quite well established in ctcl , but remains to be examined in autoimmune dermatoses .    2.707756400205796
ecp is an attractive addition to the dermatological therapies available but our experience is still preliminary .    2.351910778808967
opportunistic infections after long - term treatment with azathioprine ( aza ) have not been noted in patients with myasthenia gravis ( mg ) .    2.910009567077696
we report on a 56 - year - old woman with generalized mg who presented with cytomegalovirus infection after being treated with aza for 17 years .    2.0800294435108015
the indication for immunosuppressive treatment in mg should be regularly UNK , particularly since at least 50 % of patients can discontinue aza after two to four years without risk of exacerbation .    2.269318004144759
failure to find the gallbladder at the usual or most common atypical sites during surgery for cholecystolithiasis is a rare but known problem .    2.2890234222768764
although ultrasonography has 95 % sensitivity for the diagnosis of UNK , occasionally a small contracted gallbladder with stones and chronic cholecystitis will be difficult to visualize and can lead to UNK interpretation .    2.4879794622842875
we report on the case of a patient presenting with abdominal UNK and UNK confirmed cholecystolithiasis .    2.941363361854624
during laparoscopic cholecystectomy , the gallbladder could not be detected .    2.9010333859089137
after laparoscopic staging followed by endoscopic retrograde UNK and abdominal computed tomography , agenesis of the gallbladder was confirmed .    2.2478062013936686
this method can be considered for diagnosis of gallbladder agenesis without the need for laparotomy and thorough exploration .    2.565494568257003
right colon diverticulitis , representing 1 - 3 , 6 % of cases of UNK disease is an uncommon cause of right lower UNK pain .    3.2235882142134447
its presentation is difficult to distinguish from acute appendicitis .    2.7851317307884886
patients are between 35 and 50 years old , have a history of 2 - 3 days of abdominal pain and few gastrointestinal symptoms .    2.9093562108460262
the diagnosis is best confirmed by computed tomography and colonoscopy .    2.501127528154159
conservative treatment is justified in uncomplicated disease , whereas perforations , UNK and inflammatory tumors require resection .    2.5329044417234363
we describe the cases of six patients treated at our institution from 1991 to 1996 .    2.672825855753615
presentation , geographic variations , diagnostic procedures and management are discussed .    2.473514727104002
malignant melanoma is the most important differential diagnosis in both clinical and histologic examination of melanocytic nevi .    2.9969554617440415
uv exposure with an UNK dose and mechanical irritation of melanocytic nevi are able to induce reversible morphologic changes which simulate malignant melanoma .    2.218862573297301
these changes are associated with an increased expression of hmb - 45 antigen .    2.8152897897642366
in addition , an increased proliferation and repair activity is observed after uv exposure .    2.1764525917173794
the increased number of melanocytes located in UNK layers of the epidermis is accompanied by a change in keratinocyte adhesion molecule expression .    2.407488392690654
the uv light is also able to influence the adhesive properties of melanocytes in vitro .    2.2692305299696796
therefore , both keratinocyte - derived factors and direct influence of uv on the UNK system are probably responsible for the morphologic changes .    2.531962376979644
while these UNK evoked changes are reversible , the potential biologic relevance - especially a possible role in the initiation of the carcinogenesis cascade - UNK clarification .    2.2687893595567026
objectives minimally invasive surgical procedure for removal of the trochanteric UNK and , if necessary , UNK and / or fixation of the UNK tract at the greater UNK .    3.5555807762529072
the treatment of osteonecrosis of the femoral head involves a continuum based on a radiographic spectrum of disease .    2.6556893639051
core decompression or pharmacological agents can be utilized for the earliest small or medium - sized pre - collapsed lesions .    2.08050234567976
for these types of lesions , osteotomy has been tried by various authors with moderate success .    2.1641452916202293
for small or medium lesions that are post - collapse , various bone grafting procedures have been used .    2.2643575165273164
this approach should be UNK with a look at the articular cartilage if this is damaged or the lesion is large .    2.795630050970854
limited femoral resurfacing can be used for hips that do not have acetabular involvement .    2.8103006360627263
if there is acetabular involvement , total hip replacement remains the treatment of choice .    2.678857443293308
guillain barré syndrome ( gbs ) is an acute , inflammatory , demyelinating disease of the peripheral nerve system .    2.729319582719122
clinical hallmarks are symmetric muscle paralysis , UNK and UNK autonomic disturbances .    2.788728690233071
respiratory failure and cardiovascular instability are the main reasons for intensive care support in patients with gbs .    3.3423216791749786
the present report of a 33 year old man with miller - fisher syndrome , a variant of the gbs , discusses the management of patients with gbs in the intensive care unit .    2.6119380559851426
the UNK detection of disseminated epithelial cells in bone marrow in patients with breast cancer has been performed at many hospitals and institutes since the early 1980s .    2.523002926294747
molecular biological methods using pcr technology could extend the diagnostic spectrum .    2.521731884186866
however , one of the major problems in breast cancer is the lack of a disease - specific marker gene .    3.2629888540277343
as a result , UNK is still the standard procedure for tumour cell detection .    2.8047533934187068
objective : we report our initial experience with an improved model of the laryngeal mask airway , the intubating laryngeal mask airway ( UNK , commercial name UNK ) , which was designed by a . i . j .    2.6926240846637635
brain to improve blind endotracheal intubation through a laryngeal mask .    2.3519117208677214
for several years it has been argued that a chest tube should be placed at the scene of an accident if thoracic trauma is suspected .    2.4071717238085175
however , during emergency treatment in hospital it has been observed that a high number of such tubes have been placed incorrectly .    2.52960779813763
to validate this impression , we conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical course of 33 trauma victims who had had chest tubes placed at the scene of accident .    2.6658717506681766
it was found that 39 . 4 % of the chest tubes were placed UNK incorrectly and 21 . 2 % required some correction ; 39 . 4 % were placed correctly .    2.7714495878118046
in two cases ( 6 . 1 % ) life - threatening complications developed because of the chest tube , necessitating a thoracotomy in 1 patient and repeated pericardial UNK in the other .    3.147885456819414
based on the results of our study we believe that a more critical attitude should be adopted to the placement of chest tubes at the scene of the accident .    2.683534923766612
based upon the observation that some current approaches of quality assurance do not really come up to the specific characteristics of different psychotherapeutic settings , this article discusses quality assurance from the perspective of inpatient group psychotherapy .    2.1058560978467433
it differentiates issues of structural quality ( e . g .    2.2292273891414776
the importance of the institutional frame , rules for indication , or treatment concepts ) , process quality with special consideration of problems connected with short term group treatment , and outcome quality , which in order to be assured needs the development of methods which reflect the group setting adequately .    2.251165462312101
we report on a case of extensive intraabdominal calcifications resulting from previous bacterial peritonitis .    2.2764403514304443
the patient suffered from an obstructive ileus .    2.6834242962747394
UNK was performed and the calcifications resected .    3.083276723856345
to avoid recurrence , radiotherapy ( 15 gy ) and indomethacin were given .    2.2540286556634794
a literature review revealed only two cases of intraabdominal calcifications following peritonitis .    2.4895654055403402
in germany there is still an urgent need for action in regard to screening for breast cancer .    2.568726021617172
the UNK of research projects for mammography screening proves this .    2.478780816144462
the following reports the results of the munich field study .    2.8222384144760233
in 2 years , UNK breast cancer cases were registered ( status 6 / 98 ) .    2.291624198182111
screening data were available for UNK patients .    3.060002752985004
the reduction in mortality , found in randomized studies , due to mammography in women over 50 years old was confirmed .    2.5153410424377878
a relative reduction of 44 . 8 % in 10 - year mortality could be estimated through mammography and 25 . 1 % through palpation , in comparison with " doing nothing " .    2.585626359732248
we could also estimate the participation of screening and the used methods in the munich region .    2.3873272707479143
if the mammographies carried out today were used at 2 - year intervals for women aged between 50 and 70 years , then the mammography screening could be performed with no additional costs for 70 % of the women .    2.5162862944194075
the known facts regarding the population - based mortality and regarding the acceptance of the palpation screening and frequency of mammography are additional aspects for inclusion in the discussion of what research projects in germany are and what they should fulfill .    2.0299965540630684
insufficiency after anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) reconstruction is a typical complication .    2.3753973838080684
between 1 january 1992 and 31 december 1997 a total of 604 operations at the acl were performed in the traumatology department of nuremberg hospital .    2.5255282494967273
during the same period 48 " transplant failures " were treated .    2.3769734355299157
another reason for a re - rupture of the transplant was by trauma . the different reasons for the failure of the transplant were analysed in our patient population .    2.67429580072551
the 48 patients were classified into five groups depending on the primary operation and the means of treatment ( i = acl sutures , ii = artificial ligament , iii = semitendinosus tendon , iv and v = ipsi - or contralateral bone - patellar - bone graft harvest after acl reconstruction ) , so that the different ways of treatment were better comparable .    2.1132791387429597
of the 48 patients 36 were followed up over an average of 2 1 / 2 years using the lysholm scores and the oak scores .    2.507280752363542
the total score of the 36 patients was 81 points and can be UNK as good using the evaluation scale of lysholm and UNK .    2.4208815568290096
using the oak score we found an average of 71 to 81 points in the different groups ; results in the group with the ipsilateral bone - tendon - bone graft harvest after acl reconstruction were the worst .    2.35709017377437
the UNK using the oak score was 74 points and was considered " moderate " .    2.3201127144632716
the score results were discussed and compared with the current literature .    2.770283141247917
in this case report , we focus on the importance of scurvy as a differential diagnosis in a newborn presenting with swollen legs .    2.5913039527279826
scurvy is rare in highly developed countries and often overlooked .    2.431536905498671
medical history , clinical symptoms and radiological findings are crucial for diagnosis .    2.9271932246196646
the diagnosis is confirmed by successful treatment with UNK acid .    2.5960872141838407
hemangiomas of the skull base are rare neoplasms and are easily misdiagnosed as acoustic neuromas when occurring in the internal auditory canal .    2.3855614685874844
among these tumors , ossifying hemangiomas are characterized histologically be newly formed bone tissue within their substance .    1.987690733954488
we describe a 26 - year old female patient who presented with left - sided sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus .    2.734934490584183
t2 - weighted magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a bright space - occupying lesion of the internal auditory canal with extension to the geniculate ganglion .    2.5258040747577803
bony erosions of the internal auditory canal were proved by high - resolution computed tomography .    2.754059319900516
a hemangioma was suspected preoperatively and was resected via a middle cranial fossa approach .    2.1816153384927635
histologically , new bone formations were found in a cavernous hemangioma .    2.84478086791054
in general , radiologic findings can suggest a hemangioma of the internal auditory canal and help to differentiate it from acoustic neuroma .    2.108198764284976
based on the histological findings of intratumoral bone formation , the hemangioma in our patient was classified as an ossifying hemangioma .    2.5309620785679905
however , reactive bone formation at the borders of a tumor in the internal auditory canal can also be mistaken as new intratumoral bone formation .    2.4613866090785157
myocardial ischemia results in myocardial dysfunction .    2.6587050996849486
recovery may be delayed ( " stunning " ) , or persistent if perfusion remains reduced ( " hibernation " ) and ischemia may go on to necrosis , thus , contributing to chronic heart failure .    2.121497075822101
in addition , myocardium not directly affected by ischemia may undergo adaptive processes like hypertrophy and dilatation , which may result in chronic left heart failure .    2.117732829473455
this process is characterized by hemodynamic , neurohumoral , and progressive morphologic changes of the heart which are closely UNK .    2.629252934186187
hemodynamic changes basically consist of an increase in left ventricular filling pressure and a decrease in global ejection fraction , and , in most cases years after myocardial infarction , in an increase in systemic vascular resistance and right atrial pressure .    2.976024505250054
neurohumoral changes consist of an increase in plasma catecholamines , atrial natriuretic factor and vasopressin , and in an activation of the renin - angiotensin - system .    2.4910738043637486
plasma endothelin - 1 was recently reported to be increased in patients with heart failure , and prognosis was related to endothelin levels .    2.928382736368989
diminished response of vessels to endothelium ( UNK / no ) dependent vasodilatation suggests impairment of vascular endothelium in heart failure .    2.2284419188504314
local changes of cardiac neurohumoral systems could contribute to structural changes of the heart , e . g . , systemic activation to hemodynamic changes .    2.4960667639195697
structural changes of the heart are characterized by an increase in volume and thickness of surviving myocardium and an expansion of ischemic and necrotic myocardium .    2.7075911339818215
molecular control of these processes which include various cell types , such as cardiomyocytes and UNK , are currently an issue of intense research and could result in specific therapeutic importance .    2.4359828781618487
postoperative infection in the locomotor system may lead to malpractice UNK .    2.866273308293541
the aim of the study was to determine the success rate of these claims and the type of expert - confirmed medical negligence so that strategies for avoiding such negligence can be offered .    2.1912421432466243
a total of 261 UNK concerning suspected malpractice after postoperative infection in the locomotor system were retrospectively evaluated .    2.118763090339402
of these , 43 . 7 % claims were successful .    2.8125054260906963
the most frequent type of negligence was late diagnosis ( 34 . 2 % ) , followed by UNK treatment ( 27 . 2 % ) and insufficient surgical revision ( 5 . 3 % ) .    3.0310237313843005
in 33 . 3 % , combined types of negligence were found .    2.6293466700016346
most frequently , negligence was suspected after infection following hand surgery and internal fixation of long bones .    2.342546813243635
the highest success rate of claims was seen after puncture of joints ( 69 . 2 % ) .    2.3735384040798606
insufficient documentation was confirmed in 15 . 3 % .    2.666608012755177
the majority of negligence resulted from diagnostic and therapeutic doubts , which could be avoided , e . g . , by a clear definition of infection , consultation of a second opinion , a 2nd - look operation , undelayed and radical surgical revision , UNK follow - up and UNK documentation .    2.440030211266581
abstract patient satisfaction plays an increasing part in the analysis of the outcome of medical treatment .    3.305559122986343
the aim of the study was to compare health - related quality of life in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm after endovascular or conventional surgery .    2.762907952189231
a total of 40 patients were included ( 20 treated by endovascular and 20 by conventional surgery ) .    2.300584554597094
a questionnaire with 28 items similar to the sf - 36 was answered during scheduled UNK .    2.209608066699959
on the third postoperative day , the conventionally treated patients were more frequently confined to bed ( 80 % vs . 32 % ) and complained of intervention - related pain ( 90 % vs . 42 % ) and UNK pain ( 26 % vs . 15 % ) ; 55 % of the patients suffered from obstipation ( vs . 5 % of the endovascular group ) .    3.1124370142933655
furthermore , the preoperative psychological stress seemed to be intensified .    2.510439369470197
in comparable percentage , both the endovascular and conventionally treated patients were limited in social activities perioperatively .    2.1252589976427743
sexual dysfunction was more frequent in the conventional group ( 33 % vs . 13 % three months postoperative ) .    2.6575324243804164
in addition , the conventionally treated patients were more limited in their physical activities ( 25 % vs . 40 % ) and had more fear of UNK ( 35 % vs . 6 % ) .    2.985714484658948
the patients treated by an endovascular approach complained about frequent examinations ( 39 % vs . 5 % ) that were often related to x - ray exposure ( 67 % vs . 20 % ) .    2.7458882350251805
advantages of the endovascular treated patients were " short hospital stay " , " decreased pain " , " smaller scars " , and a " shorter UNK to bed " .    2.6788100610785626
after intervention the conventionally treated patients were more limited in almost all quality - of - life aspects .    2.440120292911493
after 3 months , differences between the groups decreased except for sexual dysfunction and limited physical activities .    2.469806279968121
the patients treated by endovascular surgery complained more about frequent x - ray examinations than the conventionally treated group .    2.427356631998313
in the majority of ventilated patients endotracheal intubation is required only for a short time period .    2.3427491231171995
however , about 20 % of the patients require prolonged mechanical ventilation .    2.8799047240489735
apart from dysfunction of the central nervous system with a reduced respiratory drive , the vast majority of patients being difficult to wean suffer from either an increased load or a decreased capacity of their respiratory muscles .    2.280768841255838
furthermore , beside compromised respiratory mechanics other causes of difficult weaning are , e . g . , left heart failure , inadequate sedation , neuropsychiatric issues , malnutrition and aspiration .    2.0742614894896287
the mere application of a consistent weaning strategy ( independent from its concrete content ) leads to an improved success rate .    2.3198417171930177
in this article three essential aspects of a weaning strategy are dealt with : 1 ) the concept of interventions ( in particular focusing on mechanical ventilation modes UNK respiratory muscles ) , 2 ) pathophysiologically based parameters to predict weaning success or failure and 3 ) organisation of the t - tube trials .    2.0546765732256915
a new approach in weaning of long - term ventilated patients is non - invasive mechanical ventilation ( nmv ) .    2.8759704822349956
compared to invasive mechanical ventilation nmv aims at reducing weaning time , decreasing complication rate and improving prognosis .    2.08162002047284
finally , the last section addresses terminal weaning .    2.335284235897828
freud based the daily psychoanalytic work on the order of the mechanic clock ( the time of the machine ) to regulate a relationship which is unique in our culture .    2.262858083364978
the temporal order of the cure responds to the logic of the temporal path .    2.296924274256826
on the opposite , in the world of the unconscious the familiar concepts of cause and effect as well as of before and after are abolished .    2.759367478884264
" symmetrical UNK " prevails ( UNK UNK ) .    2.6643989749510646
the temporal core of the analytic situation is bi - logical .    2.300204461992904
this UNK is reflected in the technical principles .    2.686932382336932
free association breaks through the logic of the temporal path , again and again .    2.2281343850780093
there are , however , different defence strategies UNK its UNK .    2.774761012010228
the tension between the time that determines the analytic setting and the UNK of free association gets once again a process of temporal order going .    2.3544995347288635
present social changes and in connection with them the changed time strategies endanger the temporal order of the analytic cure .    2.235499251174195
several historical reports focusing on the heredity of migraine , as well as recent studies on its epidemiology and molecular biology , have revealed evidence for a decisive role of genetic factors in the aetiopathogenesis of familial migraine .    2.42910062857268
indeed , family studies , UNK analyses and twin studies have shown that genetic factors play an important role in disposition towards migraine but could not explain the entire aetiopathogenesis .    2.162972509753127
the influence of UNK factors , however , remains mostly unknown .    2.9634049331845476
recent linkage analyses have provided evidence for genetic heterogeneity .    2.410126879013698
a locus for familial UNK migraine ( fhm ) , the only known type of migraine that follows autosomal - dominant transmission , has been linked to chromosome 19p13 but genetic heterogeneity has also been shown , i . e . different types of migraine could be excluded from this locus .    2.340954627267499
further investigations should concentrate on identifying the fhm gene on chromosome 19p13 , on linkage analyses with markers for different susceptibility genes , and on genomic analyses of highly informative pedigrees .    1.8971999308342171
this would lead to further clues to the pathogenesis underlying migraine and , thus , to therapeutic developments .    2.4753152283887765
radiographic findings suggestive of osteopenia and osteoporosis are frequently encountered in daily medical practice and can result from a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from highly prevalent causes such as postmenopausal and UNK osteoporosis to very rare UNK and hereditary or acquired disorders .    1.9400343278997894
as bone mass is lost , changes in the trabecular and cortical bone structure occur .    2.5176064460409013
the changes that are visible on conventional radiographs may give specific information on the etiology of the underlying disease .    2.6632457620996353
even though conventional radiography is indispensable in the differential diagnosis of osteopenia and osteoporosis , visual assessment of bone mass and its changes is subjective and strongly depends on the radiographic technique .    2.339458118110059
this article describes the author ' s experience during the 1 - year UNK pittsburgh UNK from 1 april 1996 to 31 march 1997 .    2.2539323915614897
the article is focused on the work in the UNK research center and the center for sports medicine of the department of orthopedic surgery in pittsburgh .    2.7317644920071884
the author describes projects on the biomechanics of the cruciate ligaments , using robotic technology .    2.2081214613590294
the different subgroups of hypercalciuria cannot be separated clearly by the pak calcium - load test .    1.9373149342599998
to improve the diagnosis and therapy we examined all relevant parameters of calcium metabolism in 32 patients with calcium urolithiasis and hypercalciuria ( > 6 . 25 mmol / day ) .    2.3201064923840407
we also conducted bone mineral density measurements as well as the pak calcium - load test .    2.4780747458652184
in most cases the pathophysiological constellations which pak takes as the basis for his classification of hypercalciuria could not be shown .    2.4698848843990655
to date , diagnostics only insufficiently explains the genesis of hypercalciuria ( except phpt ) .    2.0376579689441554
as a consequence , a therapeutic problem arises : a low - calcium diet should not be generally recommended , since some patients may develop osteopenia .    2.269463923437055
from our investigation the following diagnostic and therapeutic conclusions can be drawn : ( 1 ) hypercalciuria in primary hyperparathyroidism should be treated by surgical removal of the adenoma .    2.745661322376173
( 2 ) the UNK - independent osteogenic form should be treated with UNK .    3.4469569036434136
a 58 - year old man with wilson ' s disease sustained a bilateral spontaneous rupture of the quadriceps tendon .    2.9379226005346615
we discuss about relation of wilson x s disease , cupper deposits and degenerative changes of tendon tissue .    2.211761636977305
within the framework of the national health interview and examination survey 1998 the short form questionnaire sf - 36 has been applied to measure the health related quality of life ( UNK ) .    2.2317483820355806
this opened more opportunities than simply creating a new normative sample for the german adult population .    2.109053313114631
thus , the very complex UNK between morbidity , satisfaction , risk factors , health related UNK , social status , age and sex on the one side and the subjective assessment of health related quality of life on the other hand may be investigated .    2.490231175114784
first results of the survey data are presented which open the discussion of the possibilities and limits of the sf - 36 instrument for measuring health related quality of life at the population level .    2.5687695716747823
the von willebrand ' s disease affects about 1 - 3 % of the population and it is undiagnosed in most people .    3.113732966443533
originally described by the UNK physician UNK von willebrand in 1926 this disorder is associated with mucous membran bleeding including epistaxis , UNK and excessive bleeding from surgery and dental procedures .    2.434236678118526
in von UNK disease the patients have a quantitative or qualitative abnormality in the von willebrand factor ( vwf ) which has two major functions : it serves by bridging between platelets and injury site in the blood vessel wall , and it UNK as a complex with factor viii , protecting it from rapid degradation .    2.0329414300064923
about 70 % of patients have type 1 and about 10 - 20 % present UNK with type 2a and 2b vwd type 3 in about 10 % .    2.4698001402867913
by taking a clinical history of bleeding it is important to think about vwd and to make the appropriate diagnosis .    2.47214489478252
if the vwd is suspected diagnostic tests should include an activated partial thromboplastin time , bleeding time , factor viii : c , ristocetin cofactor , and vwf antigen .    1.8322386706691722
additional testing of ristocetin induced UNK adhesion ( UNK ) , the UNK structure and collagen binding test and UNK - analysis allow diagnosing the different types of v . willebrand disease .    2.6921455695147682
the treatment of choice in mild forms is the synthetic agent desmopressin .    2.3995085335390027
in patients with severe type 1 , type 2b , UNK and type 3 or in people who do not response to desmopressin , the appropriate treatment is a factor viii concentrate that is rich of vwf .    2.3238289591009016
based on the experience with 43 orthopaedic patients presenting vwd over the last 15 years a contemporary guideline for the successful perioperative management of vwd in orthopaedic surgery is presented .    2.181368160977005
in a close collaboration between the orthopaedic surgeon and the specialized UNK every invasive procedure in patients with vwd can be undertaken without the risk of excessive bleeding .    2.4945970172987635
patients with a prior myocardial infarction ( mi ) have a high risk of perioperative UNK compared with the normal population ( 5 % - 8 % vs . 0 . 1 % - 0 . 7 % ) [ 10 ] .    3.205815603773266
according to rao [ 13 ] , a reduction of this risk is possible when patients are monitored invasively and all haemodynamic parameters are kept within the physiological range .    2.183820215762301
in most institutions it is not feasible to treat patients as rao recommended : this would UNK both hospital structure and financial resources .    2.2221216808498068
we studied the incidence of perioperative mi and other cardiac events in patients with prior mi .    3.120686315024821
during the study period the anaesthesia and intensive care methods of our institution were neither changed nor influenced .    2.166978784362355
in addition to this clinical evaluation , we performed perioperative holter electrocardiographic monitoring and measured serum levels of the recently introduced marker troponin t ( parts ii and iii ) .    2.178799549050062
small basal cell carcinomas of the trunk are usually regarded as relatively harmless .    2.7553393377652253
in contrast , large and ulcerating basal cell carcinomas may become a therapeutic challenge with a less favourable prognosis and high risk of recurrence .    2.3629608914662623
the development of mutilating giant basal cell carcinomas appears less due to the biological aggressive character of the tumors , but rather to the patients ' attitude of neglect .    2.6789324528467
the case of a 62 - year - old patient , UNK such attitude , demonstrates how a common basal cell carcinoma of the trunk can grow over a period of years to a UNK ulcerating tumor .    2.6201575103194363
this epidemiologic , retrospective follow - up mortality study is based on the data gathered in the department of forensic medicine at the university hospital of johann UNK UNK university in frankfurt / main .    2.570795621891917
over a period of 21 years ( 1972 - 1992 ) , roughly 21 , 000 forensic autopsies revealed 39 cases ( 0 . 19 % ) of natural deaths occuring during sexual activity .    2.2435800118390694
except for two women , all of these cases were men of an average age of 61 . 3 years .    2.748182275919019
the most frequent cause of death was myocardial infarction ( n = 21 / 53 . 8 % ) , three of these cases involving pericardial tamponade accompanied by UNK .    3.2147523487682896
most of the deaths took place during or after sexual intercourse or manual stimulation .    2.2674742597698394
in most cases sudden death occured during the sexual act with a UNK .    2.3690707942363676
the annual incidence of sudden cardiovascular deaths during sexual activity is estimated to be 0 . 2 / 100 , 000 men .    2.6440897577974183
the risk for women is lower by a factor of 12 .    2.674826671496838
problem : an investigation into ct - controlled UNK - suction biopsy for a histological clarification of indefinite intrathoracic masses .    2.0643304240317497
current concepts in treating arthritis by gene transfer are described , including different vector systems and strategies of gene transfer into target cells .    2.06181189560938
UNK UNK gene products are a variety of growth factors which facilitate increased matrix synthesis and UNK in articular chondrocytes .    2.6752772272540213
furthermore , rheumatoid joint destruction can be treated genetically by the transfer of certain antiinflammatory cytokine genes , which provide locally high concentrations of the antiinflammatory gene product .    2.087245928253929
first clinical UNK using the irap gene ( interleukin i receptor antagonist protein ) to eliminate the inflammatory reaction caused by interleukin i in rheumatoid joints are on its way .    2.011897727152264
in order to investigate potential improvement in cartilage regeneration retroviral tgf - gene transfer in rabbit articular chondrocytes has been carried out .    1.9336625180304008
the tgf - group showed an in vitro increase in collagen type ii neosynthesis by UNK % , compared to normal chondrocytes .    2.2438406166330864
spreading depression is a fascinating phenomenon that can be provoked by chemical , electrical or mechanical stimuli of the cortex .    2.2282875415924748
spreading depression - like transient depolarizations are observed in the UNK tissue after focal ischemia .    2.769577715534509
the reduction in electrical activity and a negative direct current potential shift UNK over the cortex with a rate of 2 - 5 mm / minute are the physiological hallmarks .    2.2708459980308096
it is thought that spreading depression and peri - infarct depolarizations might play a role in the pathogenesis of migraine and stroke .    2.2342553964048073
however , these events have never been detected in humans .    2.50210444853786
this paper reviews the physiological characteristics of spreading depression and peri - infarct depolarizations and discusses their potential role in migraine and stroke .    1.821465151068334

with the increasing demands on hospitals for improved quality and lower costs , hospitals have been forced to reevaluate their manner of operation and quality assurance programms .    2.0628840433333795
hospitals have also been faced with UNK UNK and intense competition .    3.184536048058424
this article reviews current quality - management systems and examines their position in dermatology .    2.0472256044125903
the continuous follow - up of all cruciate ligament lesions showed the correctness of patient - adapted procedures .    2.49182903351883
while the gold standard for repair is a replacement procedure , direct repair with autologous augmentation is an excellent option in adolescents .    2.2605912983774887
the results of 13 single - stage reconstructions of large and complex defects in the head and neck by using eight free radial forearm flaps as well as five pectoralis major myocutaneous flaps were analyzed .    2.291643733351955
no complete flap loss occurred in any case .    2.411824476760198
the results with radial forearm flap reconstructions proved to be better functionally and aesthetically .    2.535529631358529
due to the time needed for the microvascular anastomoses , the length of the operations was sometimes prolonged .    2.4042125315551743
pectoralis major flaps were found to be more difficult to handle and were used in those cases in which the application of free radial forearm flaps was expected to produce higher risks .    2.789826948239043
psychotherapists have the alternative , to design quality assurance within certain boundaries by themselves , or otherwise leave this important task to external instances .    1.9009399965721823
those will apply their own criteria in developing a concept .    2.287581898662011
this paper discusses the question , how far quality assurance in the field of analytic psychotherapy has to accept the definitions and concepts from other fields such as industry or somatic medicine , without changing or deteriorating the quality that in the end should be improved .    2.0690279641508753
differentiation is necessary between the use of the UNK - UNK for individual quality assurance of the individual psychotherapist and for quality - and psychotherapy - research .    3.0285407631904477
this paper points out new approaches to modifying the present concept of quality assurance for the purposes of analytic psychotherapy .    2.160300668383421
UNK pemphigoid ( cp ) comprises a UNK of patients with a chronic UNK blistering disease which primarily involves mucous membranes ; lesions characteristically heal with scarring .    2.527777673210642
immunofluorescence investigations typically demonstrate deposits of tissue bound and circulating UNK of the igg and less frequently of the iga class in a linear pattern along the basement membrane zone .    2.0737950924804514
these autoantibodies are thought to play an important role in the blister formation of cp .    2.5133727829493284
a smaller group of patients with cp have autoantibodies to laminin 5 .    2.874003315171006
animal models confirm that autoantibodies binding to these two adhesion molecules ( bpag2 and laminin 5 ) are important in blister formation .    2.081879709512936
there are other UNK described in cp ; however , they are only found in small groups of cp patients and most of them are not further characterised .    2.4934108474548653
the described molecules are part of the UNK adhesion complex .    3.5072691299173284
impaired function of any component of this complex may lead to a separation of the epidermis from the dermis ; better knowledge about the single molecules and the exact localisation of UNK within these molecules may lead to further understanding of the clinical picture .    2.68871899793756
study objective : the clinical effect of ketoprofen is based not only on the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis .    2.5570726729596895
ketoprofen also acts through UNK acid as a central antagonist on the nmda receptor .    2.189800887155445
this study was carried out following the UNK / UNK preemptive effect study design .    2.9228361919895507
UNK of the bony orbit are caused mainly by craniosynostosis , facial UNK and UNK .    2.7985993616200124
this article presents the results of the surgical correction of orbital hypertelorism in 24 patients .    2.9399016348439875
using this operation technique , the bony UNK distance was decreased from an average of 47 . 6 mm to 22 . 8 mm .    2.5670584106209224
however , the distance between the soft tissues was not reduced by the same amount as the distance between the bony orbits .    2.213699904219829
the intercanthal distance decreased from an average of 58 . 5 mm to 44 . 5 mm , whereby an additional refixation of the medial palpebral ligament resulted in a reduction of the intercanthal distance to 40 . 8 mm .    2.7722761482537015
a strabismus UNK was seen preoperatively in 18 patients , postoperatively only in 8 patients .    2.5417787090528825
four of the latter had to undergo operative correction of the diplopia .    2.689116449112301
we conclude that the operative technique is not reserved only for complex cases of hypertelorism because it shows satisfactory functional and aesthetic results with a low complication rate .    2.28947335351493
four years after extensive pneumonectomy on the left side with resection of the aortic wall and patch reconstruction for a t4 carcinoma , 2 years after adjuvant radiation and 10 months after drainage therapy of late intrathoracic empyema , destruction of the infected dacron patch led to rupture of the aorta descendens .    2.286244152761767
successful primary emergency reconstruction of the aorta descendens was followed by UNK blind plasty ( UNK ) and transposition of the omentum UNK for omentoplasty of the aortal wall and reduction of the pneumonectomy cavity .    2.6485216305874983
the rate of prosthetic infections is between 0 . 3 and 2 . 5 % and must be taken into consideration even in cases of intrathoracic vascular reconstruction with alloplastic prostheses .    3.190445306584955
after lung resection it is necessary to cover up the prosthetic graft by using autogenous material to obtain prosthetic incorporation into the protective tissue .    2.075419928150828
if there is no possibility of carrying out these procedures , first aggressive local debridement of the infected vascular wall and afterwards coverage with alloplastic prosthetics with omentum transposition and thoracoplasty are essential to minimize postoperative infection and obtain solid anchorage in the surrounding tissue .    1.927593136643643
the evaluation of melanocytic tumors represents one of the most UNK and challenging aspects of the daily practice in UNK .    2.8506716295037697
for the diagnosis of malignant melanoma and melanocytic nevi , standardized and reproducible criteria are required .    2.644603678023928
in case of the diagnosis of melanoma , the histopathological report must include all important data relevant for the prognosis which may also influence the therapeutic procedure .    2.5223438683519883
the following paper summarizes the recommendations of the study group on malignant melanoma formed by the deutsche UNK gesellschaft .    2.5684730401478153
recent studies have shown that acute infections , especially of the respiratory tract , are an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia .    2.6931167424723186
additionally we know that chronic dental infections may be a risk for myocardial infarction and UNK .    2.782307326439254
however , the connection between stroke and dental infections has hardly been examined so far .    2.1567660307430523
therefore we performed a case - control study using a standardized questionaire and examination .    2.594717340830002
we investigated 66 patients consecutive to a acute cerebral ischemia / stroke and 60 age - and sex - matched UNK neurological patients as a control group .    2.015432446255433
dental status was determined by a so called total dental index ( tdi ) which reflects primarily caries , periodontitis , periapical lesions , UNK and missing teeth as well as by a panoramic index ( pi ) .    2.2777805617087026
specifically , older patients with cerebrovascular ischemia tended to have a significantly worse dental status and had more severe periodontitis and periapical lesions than control subjects .    2.184214186484444
a predefined poor dental status was associated with cerebrovascular ischemia independent from other vascular risk factors and social status .    2.4940338859833613
in conclusion , poor dental health , mainly resulting from chronic dental infections , may be associated with an increased risk for cerebrovascular ischemia .    2.4722533931056723
the results must now be verified in larger studies .    2.332536692040526
as chronic dental infections are a common and also easily treatable factor , their identification as a risk factor for stroke would be quite important in the field of preventive medicine .    2.37196790673323
adjuvant basic therapy plays a central role in the therapeutic approach to atopic eczema in childhood .    2.77997459361698
it involves the regular use of emollients and oil baths according to the clinical picture .    2.608412804016953
emollients containing urea may cause problems when used in younger children due to their UNK effect .    2.4171809328927414
glucocorticosteroids still form the mainstay of anti - inflammatory therapy and are superior to other topical drugs with anti - inflammatory effects .    2.6000904511533673
antihistamines preferably of the sedative type can be used successfully during periods of exacerbation .    2.548337119787777
systemic use of antibiotics is essential in cases of UNK atopic eczema .    3.1787941380099185
in cases of bacterial - triggered eczema , the topical use of antibiotics in cases of limited or of antiseptics in generalized disease may be helpful .    2.456361424673714
the present paper presents data obtained over a 12 year period , on the matrix synthesis and turnover in some 650 arthritic and 180 non - arthritic ( n ) human cartilages using a standardised in vitro method .    2.2007315125781024
when the relative metabolic ( synthetic / repair activity ) of these human cartilages was compared , it was demonstrated that in osteoarthritis ( oa ) and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) cartilages synthetic activity was diminished by approximately 50 % as compared with n cartilages .    2.0883649768241024
however , the turnover rate of matrix was not significantly different between non - arthritic and oa , but was very substantially increased in ra cartilages compatible with the activity of inflammatory cells and proteolytic enzymes released from pannus .    2.062703088156037
the action of 13 nsaids was compared in terms of their effect on cartilage UNK synthesis .    2.5464353629445258
3 of these nsaids were also studied in terms of their effect on cartilage collagen synthesis .    2.3467721845357112
consideration of the results in this study and from published material , led to the suggestion that nsaids may be divided into 3 categories in respect of their in vitro action on the extracellular matrix of human arthritic cartilages : 1 .    2.5638928480135865
those such as aceclofenac , UNK and UNK which can stimulate matrix synthesis 2 .    3.0207241341898916
those such as UNK , UNK acid and aspirin which appear to be without significant effect on matrix synthesis and , 3 .    2.995223274310761
those like naproxen , ibuprofen , indomethacin , UNK which significantly inhibit matrix synthesis .    2.151275349159681
it is suggested that the UNK action of group 1 nsaid is due to inhibition of locally produced il1 and consequent expression of growth factor activity .    2.307080923701539
other nsaids may also inhibit il1 synthesis or release , but probably do not have a beneficial effect on chondrocyte synthetic activity as they have toxic effects on cartilage metabolism .    1.929594185299928
these experiments led to the suggestion that nsaids such as aceclofenac would be appropriate for long - term treatment of arthritic conditions provided that one is prepared to UNK between in vitro experiments on human cartilage and what may be UNK in vivo .    2.2495254653643824
the article begins with a general introduction to the problems of pre - operative anxiety and its impact on the post - operative course development .    2.833296760555043
then the treatment of a patient who developed an anxiety - syndrome before a necessary heart operation is described .    2.9439478123592075
the treatment lasted 6 hours and included psychotherapy by guided affective imagery .    2.070816081486223
the interview was based on the assumption that patients are able to give a competent statement about their previous treatment .    2.860998973411223
the results are discussed under the aspect of therapeutic factors of psychotherapy .    2.3349965250385667
physiologically , angiogenesis in adults is a controlled process which plays a role , for example , in wound healing .    2.54645214234218
pathological angiogenesis is observed in tumor formation and represents a multifactorial process , in which specific angiogenic factors , as well as growth factors , extracellular matrix proteins and cell adhesion molecules are involved .    2.493292541094345
some of the most frequently examined angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor , UNK / basic fibroblast growth factors and the platelet - derived endothelial cell growth factor .    2.516080509843951
to date , the clinical relevance of tumor angiogenesis has been shown for several human tumors .    2.8529852675729828
for most urological tumors , the grade of tumor vessel formation , measured as UNK density , has been associated with metastases , tumor growth and clinical course .    2.312855303589872
the prognostic value of this feature of malignant growth seems to be higher than that of most of the classical and newer prognostic factors .    2.917949330991728
systematic investigations of tumor angiogenesis are becoming increasingly relevant for diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and offer opportunities for the development of new specific therapeutic approaches in clinical oncology .    2.6278205706925344
introduction : cpr is an essential part of resuscitation .    2.6699958845464002
german medical students must take part in at least two low - level basic life support courses , one for a driver ' s UNK and one for admission to medical school .    2.3391249920910533
the knowledge and skill of german medical students in cpr performance were studied .    2.1530038797002335
psychoanalysis is regarded to be mainly UNK .    2.5977818520707845
indeed , since its beginning , it was characterised by the two - sided orientation towards disorder and resources .    2.3807906611257272
contemporary concepts of the psychoanalytic encounter , especially UNK conceptions of the analysis of transference , lay the ground for better integrating both aspects .    2.2840007152754525
this development implies new approaches to the psychoanalytic process and technique , and especially to interpretation .    2.682828946989621
more than before , contemporary psychoanalytic interpretation refers to progressive coping strategies within and outside UNK processes .    1.964264138392538
during the last few decades , traumatic injuries of the hip joint have significantly increased in number , and traffic accidents have also increased .    2.539662321556231
depending on the speed , direction of the forces and the position of the femur at the moment of impact , different patterns of injury occur .    2.4106064863606167
these injuries have in common a high rate of concomitant lesions .    2.7073120588680153
several classification systems have been developed for these injuries .    3.110017419186214
commonly , UNK and UNK ' s or UNK ' s classification is used for dislocations and dislocation fractures .    3.663159803955107
for acetabular fractures , judet and letournel ' s classification and its newer version developed by UNK ( ao classification ) are generally accepted .    2.3176736692648556
fractures of the femoral head , though included in these classifications , are typically described by separate classifications like the one presented in 1957 by UNK .    2.12439550738655
the multitude of injuries occuring in the hip joint requires vast knowledge of various operative approaches .    2.3340786154297968
no single approach exists that would permit the treatment of all injuries in an ideal fashion .    2.5862831802116673
approaches are either considered limited ( kocher - langenbeck , ilioinguinal iliofemoral ) when they permit access only to a restricted segment of the joint , or extended ( extended iliofemoral , maryland , UNK ) when they allow all - around visualization of the hip joint .    2.1833082881397705
the choice of the best approach for an individual patient depends on the type of injury and also on patient variables like age , preexisting disease , and concomitant injuries .    2.5728808607170617
the decision is further influenced by the timing of surgery , the kind of fracture stabilization intended and by complications typically seen with certain approaches .    2.3591641670016954
the indication for extended procedures is only seen in patients with complex injury patterns involving both the anterior and the posterior column or in delayed cases undergoing surgery more than 3 weeks after trauma .    2.426479914154863
after a phase in which extended procedures were favored , recently a trend towards more limited approaches can be recognized because of their lower complication rate .    2.0831160295858604
a relation between myocardial ischemia and induction of ventricular arrhythmias can be demonstrated in patients with coronary heart disease - in contrast to patients with primary non ischemic cardiac diseases - using a combined metabolic - electrophysiological investigation protocol consisting of programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation with simultaneous measurement of the arterio / coronary venous difference for lactate , UNK , free fatty acids and amino acids .    2.4455014023418333
there are significant metabolic UNK between both ischemic and non ischemic heart disease under pacing stress conditions as well as at rest .    2.3488484082238292
a 52 year old female with parry - romberg syndrome presented with gradual atrophy of the subcutaneous fat and muscle on her chest and back .    2.109827539539008
the disease process was limited to the c3 to t2 UNK on the right side .    2.7346089770569453
in addition , there was muscle atrophy of the right arm and extending down the back to t10 , als well as right sided paralysis of the diaphragm .    2.214531581833692
sympathetic nerve blockage reduced pain and UNK ; no progression was seen over several months using nmr to monitor the patient .    2.1585099904409075
the parry - romberg syndrome has been defined in many ways ; in view of this unusual case , we review the literature , attempting to provide a more accurate case definition .    2.563272863456768
between 1990 and 1996 , 129 children ( mean age 4 . 8 years ) with hip pain were examined consecutively .    2.9910014057152603
in group i ( n = 100 , mean age 4 . 14 + / - 2 . 2 ) , transient synovitis of the hip was diagnosed ; group ii ( n = 29 , mean age 7 . 3 + / - 2 . 1 ) showed the following diagnoses : perthes ' disease ( n = 12 ) , early slipped capital femoral epiphysis ( n = 5 ) , UNK ' s dysplasia ( n = 2 ) , septic arthritis of the hip ( n = 2 ) , osteomyelitis of the acetabulum ( n = 1 ) , abscess of the UNK ( n = 1 ) , UNK of the hip joint ( n = 1 ) , ewing ' s sarcoma of the os pubis ( n = 1 ) , hip dysplasia ( n = 1 ) .    3.468580380955661
three patients who had synovitis developed perthes ' disease and were assigned to group ii .    2.55381413874294
the efficiency of ultrasound , scintigraphy and mri as diagnostic tools was tested in the examination of painful hip .    2.4618477975169464
a capsular distension was present in 73 cases and showed a significant statistical difference ( t - test , p < 0 . 001 ) in group i between affected and unaffected hips .    2.631320695746133
there were no differences in the measurements of the epiphyseal and metaphyseal width in group i between the affected and the non - affected side ( t - test , p = 0 . 91 , p = 0 . 57 ) and between the first sonographic evaluation at presentation and at the follow - up ( t - test , p = 0 . 053 , p = 0 . 75 ) .    2.681739422764069
mri was performed , because of persistent joint effusion , in 10 cases in group i , and perthes ' disease was excluded .    2.9272776116327517
in group ii the use of an mri allowed the diagnosis in 89 % of the cases .    3.158308601755513
sonographic examination , together with x - ray examination and serological testing , represent the first choices in the evaluation of a painful hip at presentation and in the follow - up of transient synovitis .    2.8221359794722165
mri should always be performed when abnormalities are present at the clinical and sonographic examination , and when the x - ray does not allow a clear diagnosis .    2.7902309105758514
a 36 - year old woman was presented to our hospital with congenital ventricular septal defect and one - vessel coronary artery disease ( 75 % proximal left main coronary artery ) for cabg and repair of the UNK .    2.481593480761457
after induction , a transesophageal echocardiographic ( tee ) baseline examination was performed , showing a severely dilated coronary sinus ( cs ) measuring approximately 3 cm ( abnormal > 1 cm ) .    2.0202835587735435
we suggested a persistent left superior vena cava ( plsvc ) draining into the cs .    2.1287961974084704
plsvc is a common venous congenital anomaly , with a reported incidence of 0 . 5 % in general population and in 3 - 5 % of patients with congenital heart defect .    3.3531514964705122
injection of echo - contrast solution in a left arm vein , visualizing UNK UNK through the plsvc into the cs confirmed our suspicion .    2.0518686636313217
the diagnosis of a plsvc and dilated cs is a contraindication for retrograde cardioplegia because of the loss of cardioplegia into the plsvc resulting in a inadequate myocardial protection .    2.3786960105031545
it may be difficult to pass a pulmonary artery catheter ( pac ) through a left internal or left subclavian vein and it may be associated with UNK .    2.5192050404525856
a chest radiograph shows the anomalous course of the pac along the left heart .    2.6223956282363456
teleradiologysystems can differ considerably in their features .    2.422213161582018
the most important differences lie in the mode of image data acquisition , data transfer , data safety aspects and the possibilities of interaction between seperate UNK units .    2.2319024534973417
a selection of commercially available teleradiologysystems is presented and compared .    2.6851600842217804
UNK are the third frequent pediatric brain tumors .    2.6106739526900946
complications after surgical treatment are common .    3.1071854416207327
the most frequent complications are endocrine disturbances , vision field defects , deteriorated acuity , cognitive or psychological deficiency as well as significant weight gain .    2.2631648865151544
a case of complete vision loss right after surgical removal of UNK is reported .    2.747472798097801
magnetic resonance image showed an edema of the chiasm .    2.474341531287049
no damage of anatomical structure could be detected .    2.5882267209382652
seventeen days after surgery the patient reported intermittent visual impressions for the first time .    2.533653928626734
over the following weeks his UNK improved to 0 . 5 , while the chiasm edema disappeared .    2.8618689016557215
electron beam computed tomography ( ebct ) allows UNK and quantification of calcium in the coronary arteries .    2.421553529919647
this has been demonstrated to correlate well with the overall plaque burden in the coronary arteries .    2.4203061882696733
ebct is , therefore , well suited for the detection of early stages of coronary atherosclerosis .    3.0128501414999613
especially in asymptomatic patients with several risk factors , staging coronary artery disease by coronary calcium , scanning may allow prognostic assessment and guide preventive and therapeutic interventions .    2.1504140557467855
we report an unusual complication in a 53 - year - old woman following ileostomy for crohn ' s disease 22 years previously .    2.26910967653774
a stenosis of the distal colonic segment was the reason for the formation and subsequent rupture of a huge colonic mucocele .    2.727600077245416
to our knowledge , this is the first report of a ruptured mucocele of colonic origin after ileostomy .    2.145335153766134
the brain is an important target organ for gonadal hormones .    2.6511169682633486
estrogens have protective and trophic effects on neural systems and modulate the activity of several neurotransmitter systems .    2.0896839743262388
initial studies support the hypothesis that estrogen therapy in menopause may have protective effects toward the development of dementia , particularly alzheimer ' s disease .    2.33443704431236
furthermore , estrogens may improve verbal UNK , memory , and mood in elderly women .    2.0778272708026133
still , the available evidence is not sufficient to support general treatment recommendations with respect to estrogens and the therapeutic targets dementia and depression .    2.5299893442379124
a 38 - year - old male patient presented with circumscribed scleroderma ( UNK cm ) in the left pectoral area .    2.752253821115628
UNK of the skin in the area of the lilac ring ( morphoea ) was quantified by means of laser - doppler flux ( ldf ) .    2.7245900129907805
at the lilac border of the morphoea ldf was increased to 420 % of the reference value recorded for the unaffected skin of the contralateral side .    2.515400312285269
immediately after 13 days of antibiotic therapy ( UNK UNK penicillin g per day , i . v . )    2.8867400925488926
ldf normalized , though clinical changes were hardly apparent at this stage .    2.130304048432281
by 6 months later , ldf was still in the normal range , and clinical signs , such as induration and UNK UNK , had also significantly improved .    2.9335457713336512
ldf measurements allow assessment of the therapeutic response to antibiotic therapy at a very early stage while the clinical situation is still unchanged .    2.507493768027126
it is generally accepted that the progression of an idiopathic UNK deformity with a cobb angle of between 25 ° and 40 ° can be stopped by brace treatment alone provided that the generally acknowledged criteria for the treatment concerning skeletal growth of the individual are respected .    2.1614490882899844
the total costs for a department of anaesthesia amount to a fraction of the total hospital budget that is proportional to the overall number of hospital departments ; this means anaesthetic departments are in general not cost drivers .    2.0345862780092316
the medical treatment of erectile dysfunction includes the systemic ( oral , epidermal , intramuscular ) as well as the local ( intracavernosal , intraurethral ) application of pharma UNK agents .    2.1716379434442254
up to now only UNK , a well - known alpha - receptor blocking agent , and sildenafil , a newly introduced phosphodiesterase v inhibitor with predominant peripheral action , have been approved and listed in germany .    2.2286443541468373
other oral agents under investigation are trazodone and apomorphine ( central action ) as well as UNK ( peripheral action ) .    2.3029986001473572
for the small group of patients with an established testosterone deficit , the epidermal or intramuscular substitution of testosterone seems to be a reasonable alternative to other therapeutic options .    2.7614165900857612
for the local application of pharmacological agents , intracavernosal injection therapy and intraurethral application ( " UNK urethral system for erection " , UNK ) are available .    2.4791369831481633
currently , several promising pharmacological agents with different modes of action and routes of administration are under investigation .    2.13388143066627
the ultimate goal of these basic and clinical research efforts is to develop a specific and " tailored " therapy for each individual patient .    2.2256389872588
while the pharmacological therapy of erectile dysfunction will most likely continue to be the therapeutic standard for most patients , it will certainly be augmented by devices ( i . e . vacuum erection devices , " functional UNK of the corpus cavernosum " , UNK ) and surgical treatment options ( vascular and prosthetic surgery ) .    2.5176022122238826
we treated a large superficial basal cell carcinoma ( ca .    2.559477394153271
UNK cm ) on the right breast in a 48 - year old woman with photodynamic UNK ( pdt ) .    2.892680980837927
fractionated pdt was performed by topical application of - aminolevulinic acid ( - ala , 20 % ) with subsequent red light ( UNK - 750 nm ; 180 j / cm2 ) in three sessions .    2.5806364631610004
nearly total remission of the tumor resulted ; however , a few residual neoplastic islands partly infiltrating the nipple - areola complex could be detected by photodynamic diagnosis ( pdd ) .    2.432103254685168
these fluorescent areas were marked , excised , and the defect was closed by a rotation advancement flap .    2.5110682816497527
by combining pdt and surgery , this large tumor was treated with excellent cosmetic results .    2.4005417481856934
this case demonstrates the efficiency of topical pdt with adjunctive plastic surgery controlled by pdd even in large tumors .    2.1352249842683397
in a prospective trial patients were interviewed in two periods , from 1988 to 1990 and from 1993 to 1995 .    2.278912513444283
ninety out of 189 patients ( 47 , 6 % ) with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of malignant melanoma who noted morphological changes in a pigmented lesion reported the mole had been present at least 10 years .    2.4662486099639804
20 , 7 % stated it was present since birth .    2.5783354744589606
156 out of 189 patients ( 82 , 5 % ) noticed changes in the lesion over the time .    2.766376123306103
growth , UNK and elevation were the most frequent changes but no significant early sign of disease was found .    2.984868289184701
bleeding and UNK were found with tumor thickness > 1 , 5 mm and thus be signs of an advanced stage .    2.843067614546786
in the second period of the survey from 1993 to 1995 the physician was frequently consulted earlier .    2.2445507513905536
the main reasons for the delay between identification by the patient and seeking medical UNK were lack of symptoms and the notion that the lesion was harmless .    2.579161123990342
only 72 out of 189 patients ( 38 , 1 % ) visited the physician on their own initiative .    2.47727822675866
the primary evaluation of the " UNK lesion " was done by a primary care physician in 57 % , by a dermatologist in 32 % and by others in 11 % of our cases .    2.7202884110072945
a diagnosis of a non - melanoma was made and no further steps were initiated by 27 % of the primary care physicians and 22 , 7 % of the surgeons , gynecologists or internists .    3.0541985600729378
only 5 % of the dermatologists misdiagnosed the lesions .    3.434421542210266
in the second trial period from 1993 to 1995 in all physician groups the rate of misdiagnosis increased due to changes in UNK services in the context of UNK in our health care system in east germany .    2.493421679116099
whereas 83 , 2 % of the patients first evaluated by dermatologists had a surgical removal of the mole within the first 2 months after consultation , the proportion for those diagnosed by non - dermatologists was only 58 , 5 % .    2.625223662241184
the rate of primary treatment by surgeons , often with a small safety margin , also increased .    2.4018600649760953
in 45 patients with parkinson ' s disease , we investigated coping behavior and its correlations to demographic and disease - related data , locus of control , depression , and psychosocial adaptation .    2.402671705361656
active , problem oriented , and self - UNK strategies were predominantly used and regarded as especially helpful by the 27 men and 18 women ( age : 56 years ; duration of illness : 9 years ) .    2.0987930998596704
while age and sex were not associated with coping , external locus of control correlated positively to " depressive coping " and duration of illness correlated negatively to " distraction and self - UNK . "    2.342190991907905
coping strategies regarded as maladaptive and a small degree of internal locus of control correlated to unfavourable results for depression and satisfaction .    2.039701760668314
we introduced a new ophthalmological atlas including icd coding on the world wide web .    2.0094587533030497
so far , more than 500 UNK slides of typical and interesting ophthalmological findings have been selected and UNK .    2.3271228748107142
these pictures were integrated in a data base , which was arranged for ease and speed of search and retrieval .    2.2852824592340553
in its background , the data base contains a list of over UNK icd - encoded diagnoses to which the picture - documented findings are linked .    2.1581622645472294
comments on pictures can be added by the author or by users .    2.2716551735417503
the data base contains several lists , such as a list of icd codes and diagnoses , a list of all pictures with corresponding diagnoses , a list of all diagnoses and number of picture , a list of those diagnoses for which the corresponding picture is available , as well as a list of comments on each picture .    2.219079420048669
special program scripts handle the user ' s search key words for diagnoses and extract the required information out of the data base , using windows UNK .    2.1089628487341225
search results are presented on an automatically built - up UNK .    2.533559362478599
to provide fast speed of search all pictures initially are shown in a small UNK ( UNK ) with little amount of data .    2.585158848454298
the related full - size picture is retrieved by a single mouse click .    2.198537590373485
moreover , the name and institution of the author , UNK hints and comments on pictures by the author or by users are offered for each diagnosis available .    1.907713063421605
the giessen ophthalmological picture atlas can be reached in the internet .    2.341057057085471
it allows a fast search free of charge from all over the world and , therefore , offers an additional option to obtain specific ophthalmological information for various purposes .    2.1157866151794957
even though the function of the myometrium is vital for the existence of all mammals , there is little knowledge about its UNK .    2.5837424839023826
so far , only the contractile filaments actin and myosin have been identified .    2.4205279146804313
there is no evidence for the existence of other UNK systems , either my means of electron microscopy or histochemically .    2.379648125738561
the indications , operative procedure , postoperative complications and advantages of laparoscopic ileostomy and colostomy as compared with " open " enterostomy are described and demonstrated in our own patients with crohn ' s disease .    2.215352851631978
major indications for laparoscopic enterostomy in patients with crohn ' s disease are stenosis , UNK incontinence and complex anal fistulas in those with severe crohn ' s UNK .    2.610868912053257
most crohn patients tolerate laparoscopic enterostomy and an increasing number demand this minimally invasive technique .    2.266350153444702
the period of convalescence is much shorter and complications in connection with laparotomy are minimized .    2.482423288234956
we report on a complete longitudinal rupture of the urethra in combination with a rupture of the pubic UNK and pelvic fracture during spontaneous vaginal delivery .    2.542741815440639
only after stabilisation of the pelvic fracture by external skeletal fixation adaptation of the urethra was possible .    2.510585185808527
three weeks later after removing of the transurethral catheter a mild stress incontinence could be observed .    2.079478226862482
in the follow up one year later the patient was completely continent .    3.158646350696306
the cosmetic result was satisfactory .    2.5604216284522012
an unclear haematuria after delivery needs a meticulous urological examination .    2.169089896297644
early repair of urethral disruption minimize the risk of severe incontinence .    2.6851212413355037
coordinated care between the trauma surgeon and urologist is required for successful treatment of this rare combined injury after birth .    2.248811366355702
the increased consumption of " ecstasy " ( mdma , 3 , 4 - UNK - UNK ) has also increased the number of life - threatening intoxications .    3.123749052040864
from a medline search of the years 1992 - 1996 , reports were registered and evaluated .    2.3033405028602014
besides cerebral , cardiorespiratory , renal , and hepatic symptoms , hyperthermia syndromes such as malignant hyperthermia , neuroleptic malignant syndrome , or the serotonin syndrome were common .    1.955122742986885
in addition to a discussion of the intoxication symptoms and their acute and intensive - care therapy , the psychological and physiological effects of " ecstasy " will be described .    2.320150812306436
some historical considerations of the topic are included in this review .    2.7459128189514597
the goal of this prospective , randomised and double - blind pilot - study was to investigate the analgesic potency and the side - effects of tramadol enantiomers in clinical practice .    2.519392469336554
one hundred patients recovering from orthopaedic surgery with a postoperative pain intensity of more than 50 on a visual analogue scale 0 - 100 mm ( table 1 ) were recruited for the study .    2.4581016241944633
they were treated in a randomised , double - blind way with a maximal dose of 150 mg i . v .    2.3791013328260737
( + ) - , ( - ) - tramadol , racemate , or 15 mg i . v .    2.181852223296023
morphine or saline in the placebo group ( 5 groups , 20 patients each ) .    2.468463562925349
the primary criterium of efficacy was the number of responders defined as patients with a pain reduction of at least 20 on vas after 40 min .    2.7314017734183693
in case of pain , responders were allowed to continue with the double - blind drug up to six hours .    2.460438303728505
the non - responders were treated with morphine as the rescue analgesic .    3.115742592440919
six patients terminated the study prematurely .    2.496530267892602
one patient was excluded because of an allergic reaction to morphine , one patient could not be treated sufficiently with morphine , four were excluded because of protocol violations .    2.4679652388999203
there were 8 responders in the ( + ) - tramadol - , 6 in the ( - ) - tramadol - and 6 in the racemate group , 16 * ( p < 0 , 05 ) in the morphine group , and 5 in the placebo group .    2.450351168095118
pain intensity after 40 min was reduced by 20 ( p < 0 , 05 ) , 17 ( p < 0 , 05 ) , 17 ( p < 0 , 05 ) , 36 ( p < 0 , 01 vs placebo , p < 0 , 05 vs ( + ) - , ( - ) - tramadol , and racemate group ) and 5 mm on the vas in the ( + ) - , ( - ) - , ( + / - ) - tramadol - , morphine - and placebo - group , respectively .    2.4073102928571233
thirty eight adverse events like nausea , vomiting , pco2 - increase , and urinary retention occurred in 20 patients , most frequently in the ( + ) - tramadol - and morphine group .    2.2845558072843044
sedation was significantly less profound in the ( - ) - tramadol group 1 - 4 h postoperatively .    2.436068649396227
there were no side - effect in the tramadol racemate group .    2.492477496441591
the enantiomers were equal to the racemate in analgesic potency , but inferior by far to morphine .    2.155686029583863
they showed more adverse events and , hence , can not be preferred to the racemate in postoperative pain therapy .    2.50932144386937
a 36 - year - old man known as chronic alcohol UNK presently suffered from arthralgia and showed bilateral UNK kidneys by sonography and computed tomography .    2.037418643461418
because of an unclear renal failure a kidney biopsy was performed and presented typical chronic renal oxalosis with massive oxalate crystal deposits , tubular atrophy and UNK fibrosis .    2.055091069889386
since the man had never shown signs of hyperoxaluria in his life before , a secondary oxalosis was supposed .    2.06457631077226
the subsequently prompted exploration established a three to four times abuse of UNK UNK with UNK UNK 12 years before during the patient ' s UNK time as a UNK UNK .    2.916070440513919
such UNK contain ethylene glycol ( UNK ) as UNK commonly known to cause in toxic doses acute renal tubular necrosis with hyperoxaluria .    2.5063817303702978
the presented case , however , suggests a rare UNK ethylene glycol poisoning with initial renal tubular damage , oxalate crystal deposition and subsequent chronic interstitial oxalate nephritis with tubular atrophy , interstitial fibrosis and chronic renal failure .    2.0338948038760583
undergoing chronic hemodialysis , the patient died 5 months after the kidney biopsy diagnosis by acute heart failure .    2.73016462125443
at autopsy , progressed chronic renal oxalosis could be confirmed .    2.377501588805096
decompensated oxalate cardiomyopathy with disseminated myocardial oxalate crystal deposits caused acute heart failure promoted by myocardial hypertrophy in renal hypertension .    2.0081061279274923
insulinomas are rare tumors and account for 90 % of all endocrine pancreatic tumors .    3.0202142208974507
they typically present as a solitary tumor , but may occur in multiple sites ( e . g .    2.4364056202506634
multiple endocrine neoplasia type i ) or as a malignant disease in 10 % of cases and rarely as UNK or islet cell UNK .    2.8453228345738557
UNK symptoms lead to the diagnosis ; inadequate high insulin and c - peptide secretion with hypoglycemia in the fasting test confirm the diagnosis .    2.2523817885305015
preoperative localization is not necessary prior to the first operation .    3.109454129895582
the standard operation is enucleation or , depending on size and location , resection .    2.5510252326167806
the treatment of multiple tumors and islet cell hyperplasia with a high risk of recurrence is problematic .    2.817238515293286
subtotal resection plus enucleation seems to be better than selective tumor resection .    2.7479215127679457
in malignant insulinomas , mostly presenting with liver metastases , aggressive surgical therapy with hepatectomy and debulking , UNK and systemic chemotherapy are the modalities of choice .    2.3293772198527547
mr spectroscopy is the only method for non - invasive detection of various aspects of cardiac metabolism in humans .    2.7714501013427313
while the UNK nucleus of water and fat molecules is the signal source for mr imaging , the mr spectroscopic technique allows for the study of a number of other nuclei , such as 13c , UNK , UNK , 31p , UNK and UNK .    2.6790557743006906
clinical applications presently are confined to the 31p nucleus .    2.4031978176675253
31p - mr spectroscopy allows the non - invasive study of cardiac high - energy phosphate metabolites atp and phosphocreatine .    2.4228277364575663
the phosphocreatine / atp ratio is considered an index of the UNK state of the heart .    3.089862861683422
possible clinical indications include heart failure , valve disease and coronary artery disease .    2.504513481642702
in heart failure , the phosphocreatine / atp ratio is reduced and correlates with clinical severity , ejection fraction and prognosis .    2.3564170514650256
in mitral and aortic valve disease , a reduced phosphocreatine / atp ratio may indicate the optimum timing for valve replacement .    2.239794826355585
in coronary artery disease , a regional decrease of phosphocreatine during stress ( " biochemical ergometry " ) may indicate local ischemia .    2.229520427772128
furthermore , absolute quantification of high - energy phosphates may allow diagnosis of myocardial viability .    2.4020503474921298
major technical developments , leading to improved spatial and temporal resolution will be necessary to establish mr spectroscopy as a routine clinical tool .    2.4883218299095335
a retrospective and partly prospective study was conducted to analyse both clinically and cephalometrically the craniofacial growth pattern of patients with isolated and syndrome - related premature craniosynostosis after standardized fronto - orbital and midface advancement .    2.22330664915367
the file data of 293 children with fronto - orbital advancement were evaluated over an average period of 4 . 4 years .    2.466389074831283
in addition , lateral UNK of 117 patients from this group were cephalometrically analysed .    2.0837433153926392
moreover , late results of 36 children and 8 adults with midface - advancement with an average follow - up period of 4 . 5 years were assessed .    2.544614167944034
in contrast to linear craniectomy and so - called lateral UNK advancement , in only 8 . 2 % of cases ( 24 out of 293 patients ) were relapses requiring reoperation found in this study after fronto - orbital advancement .    2.514871244263101
the evaluations indicate that with simple forms of craniosynostosis such as UNK and UNK predominantly very good or good growth can be observed .    2.518163623731096
cephalometric evaluation confirmed the limited potential of growth in the area of the anterior skull base and in the midface in the presence of syndrome - related UNK .    2.9725894291908666
in such cases the cephalometrically confirmed maxillary hypoplasia , which increases in severity in the following order of syndromes ` UNK - UNK - crouzon - UNK - UNK ' , could be influenced only to a limited degree by fronto - orbital advancement .    2.4718569170312907
for this reason midface advancement is of secondary importance in children with very severe anomalies .    2.335762048417287
in the present evaluation , a high rate of relapse of midfacial hypoplasia was to be found in children and adolescents after this operation in accordance with other references .    2.6649982533737773
therefore , the indication for le fort iii osteotomy in the growth period should be limited .    2.439333711832001
the introduction of UNK into medicine and especially into the treatment of severe lung injury is a fascinating scientific task .    2.5802069091158972
many recall the famous experiments from clark et al .    2.178566330418168
in 1966 when he demonstrated " UNK with perfluorocarbons " in the mammal species for the first time .    2.1595101894225865
perfluorocarbons ( saturated UNK ) have unique chemical and physical properties which made them attractive substances for UNK application .    2.063265414177299
the strong c - f UNK in the perfluorocarbon molecules are responsible for their chemical stability , biochemical UNK , high capacity to UNK respiratory gases , low surface tension and high vapor pressures .    2.1249963496337676
furthermore , the high density of the pfc lead to radio - opacity and their distribution to dependent lung areas .    2.0959577494900072
the efficacy of pfc liquid , applied by tlv / plv has been demonstrated in numerous animal studies using different models of acute lung injury .    2.194759637135329
currently , several mechanisms of action of perfluorocarbon fluids in acute lung injury are discussed : recruitment of atelectatic alveoli , prevention of endexpiratory collapse of alveoli ( " liquid peep " ) , redistribution of perfusion , oxygen transport , surfactant like effects and decrease of inflammation .    2.0228685773494703
however , the results of the first randomised , controlled study of plv in 90 adult patients suffering from severe respiratory failure ( ali / ards ) showed no differences between plv and conventional treatment .    2.4877240321025478
furthermore , the instillation of relatively large amounts of liquid into the lungs poses several technical challenges and may be associated with complications such as UNK , pneumothoraces and hypoxia .    2.3161837097197564
since mammal lungs are evolutionary specialised to gas exchange using atmospheric oxygen , the application of UNK , even if they transport respiratory gases very well is not physiologic .    2.369622921116661
to overcome these unwanted side effects , we developed a technique of perfluorocarbon vaporisation in analogy to the application of inhalation anaesthetic agents .    2.4648626893525063
after resolving some technical issues , this application technique was used successfully in an animal model of acute lung injury .    2.290581700751323
vaporisation of perfluorohexane in a concentration of 18 vol . % of inspired gas improved significantly oxygenation and lung compliance .    2.062445687232196
though these results are promising , mechanisms of action , dose - efficacy relation , surfactant - perfluorocarbon interaction or anti - inflammatory effects of UNK perfluorohexane are still unclear .    2.219518935076937
these questions need to be clarified before this technique can be applied clinically .    2.7073193830028934
however , the inhalation of vapor , a technique already familiar to anaesthesiologists should avoid risks of large amounts of fluids in the bronchoalveolar space .    1.879296134843088
furthermore , this technique can be administered by established anaesthetic equipment with the advantage of exact dosing , continuous monitoring , and demand application in a way near to clinical routine .    2.232321480020165
vdd pacing using a single pass lead for complete heart block is well described in adults but there are few reports of its use in children .    2.2219890288419637
we have used 6 different standard adult size single pass leads and 5 different pacemaker generators in 21 children and adolescents aged 3 . 7 - 17 . 2 years ( mean 9 . 9 years ) and weighing 13 . 5 to 76 kg ( mean 34 . 3 kg ) .    2.3434148098361622
congenital complete heart block was present in 14 patients ( with associated heart disease in 2 of them ) , surgical complete heart block in 6 patients and 2 : 1 av block of uncertain cause in 1 patient .    2.4164202692235857
in 10 patients , the vdd system was their first pacing system .    2.5865779951971044
in 11 of the patients , 1 - 6 previous systems had been used and simultaneous extraction of ventricular leads ( 10 ) and / or atrial leads ( 5 ) was performed .    2.8531581149076812
all leads were introduced via a subclavian vein puncture ( using the extraction sheath when present ) and the atrial UNK was placed low in the right atrium to provide UNK for further growth while maintaining atrial sensing .    2.1225274412896935
there was one early micro - displacement and the lead was repositioned .    2.124897065859515
over a follow - up period of 2 - 64 months ( mean 32 months ) , all but 1 of the patients have maintained low ventricular pacing thresholds and adequate atrial signals for reliable pacing at rest and with exercise .    2.5343895227866162
during this time some have undergone considerable growth .    2.464506042473798
in 1 patient , atrial sensing was lost after cardiopulmonary bypass for additional cardiac surgery at 24 months and the pacemaker was programmed into vvir mode .    2.1093532650958213
one patient with coexisting congenital heart disease died suddenly at 3 years but the pacing system had no UNK at autopsy .    2.1400439230732204
the standard adult size single pass lead provides a simple means to enable reliable atrial synchronous ventricular pacing in growing children with complete heart block .    2.009919911355466
open reduction with internal stabilization is considered to be the standard therapy for the treatment of displaced acetabular fractures .    3.2362144522154663
the internal fixation is routinely achieved by the use of plates and screws .    3.011530598394302
the use of cerclage wires and UNK as a reduction aid and definitive implant for stabilization has only occasionally been reported in the literature .    2.3117519392328347
the indication was mostly limited to use in elderly patients with insufficient bone stock .    2.516853964794203
a newly instrument developed on the basis of a standard bone UNK is presented .    2.575983998541563
it allows a safe , UNK application of a cerclage wire around the greater UNK notch through use of the second window of the ilioinguinal approach .    2.419351119393267
a wide dissection at the " outside " of the pelvis is not necessary .    2.757350399406147
a 35 year old patient developed UNK in the red UNK areas of his tattoo .    3.14599321963399
histological examination revealed a lichenoid , UNK infiltrative pattern , that could be distinguished from frank lymphoma by means of electron microscopy , immunohistochemistry and molecular biology .    2.471048820895915
the presence of dermal dendritic cells suggests a dermal - allergic pathogenesis of non - granulomatous tattoo reactions .    2.2950532783457067
therapy of choice is an excision of the inflamed areas .    3.0230505596297914
interventional duct occlusion is increasingly performed with detachable coils .    2.356284716989023
they are not UNK but can be implanted in a simple manner .    3.0283536500554726
the rate of embolization was high ( 28 % ) in the first 14 procedures ; however , it declined to 5 % in the last 20 patients .    3.2583169232369245
we modified the technique by partially blocking the duct , when necessary , with a catheter which was advanced from the pulmonary artery and by implanting up to three coils .    2.3226546509566677
there was only one embolization and one small residual shunt in the last 20 patients .    2.277269297704391
the mean fluoroscopy time in these patients was 11 . 0 + / - 5 . 8 minutes and decreased to 7 . 0 + / - 3 . 2 minutes in the last 10 patients with successful closure .    2.912702599152104
considering our experience , we continue to recommend the use of gianturco - coils especially in the small duct which can be closed UNK at low cost .    2.6937063658140556
this review presents data supporting the involvement of the dopaminergic system in depressive illness .    2.4229667765795386
UNK research , animal research and clinical studies have shown that a dysfunction of the UNK dopaminergic system could be associated with depressive symptoms .    3.092577963950706
furthermore , the chronic administration of antidepressants in animals provokes a UNK and enhanced expression of dopaminergic receptors .    2.2570572052370244
although the dopaminergic system has received little attention in biological research on depression in the last decades , current research on the dopaminergic system is about to change this situation .    2.253065508483045
athletes who need high endurance capacity often use training at moderately high altitude ( 1500 - 3000 m ) to improve oxygen delivery and utilization because of a hypoxia - induced increase of the red blood cell volume and UNK at the muscular level .    2.2148928169123074
as maximal heart rates decrease at high altitude and plasma lactate levels for a given workload change during prolonged exposure to high altitude , it can be difficult to control and adapt the intensity and duration of the work - UNK .    2.329223776813934
furthermore , maximal performance capacity decreases and therefore training intensity at high altitude is usually reduced compared to training at sea level .    1.9402911597883465
to avoid these disadvantages at high altitude a concept of living at moderately high altitude and training at lower elevations , termed " live high - train low " evolved , opposing the conventional concept of " live high - train high " .    1.8818849019201929
a third option using a UNK chamber ( " live low - train low " ) is hardly used anymore for training athletes .    2.1670070713258758
studies on the effects of conventional high - altitude training for the improvement of athletic performance often lack a UNK controlled design and yield controversial results .    2.2685039097561597
regarding the new concept of " live high - train low " there is only one controlled study on college athletes and it shows a minor advantage of this new approach compared to conventional high - altitude training .    2.127128137094655
however , training concepts are especially important for UNK competitive athletes , and controlled studies with such individuals are very difficult to perform .    2.206169124653354
therefore , it appears that today we cannot answer the question of whether altitude - specific physiologic factors or non - altitude - related benefits of training UNK account for the success of individual athletes .    2.2832023518057043
purpose : to answer the following questions : whether reliable detection of lesions is possible in low - field - mri - system ( magnetom open 0 . 2 t ) equipped with currently available hard - and software components in comparison to high field system ( magnetom impact 1 . 0 t ) .    2.241913243917773
furthermore , whether localization of lesions suspect in mr - mammography can be realized in mr system of low field ( magnetom open 0 . 2 t ) .    2.1332365525325394
patients and methods : in 11 patients , suspect lesions were diagnosed in diagnostic mr - mammography acquired with high field system ( magnetom impact 1 . 0 t ) and were compared to low field mr - mammographies of 0 . 2 t ( magnetom open 0 . 2 t ) .    2.28561045376268
in six of the 11 patients a suspect lesion was localized using wire marking .    2.3245612483407654
results : all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic mr - mammography ( magnetom impact 1 . 0 t ) were also clearly identified in the 0 . 2 t system ( magnetom open ) .    2.170662869217896
in six cases wire marking was performed without any complications and with an accuracy of k 0 . 5 cm distance to the lesion .    2.5073517417094187
conclusion : although studies in the 0 . 2 t system clearly showed inferior UNK ( 34 . 6 vs . 83 . 1 ) and UNK ( 14 . 6 vs . 43 . 5 ) compared to studies with the high field system , all lesions considered suspect in diagnostic mr - mammography were reliably identified also in 0 . 2 t studies .    2.4816378290177736
due to its open construction permitting permanent access to the breast and due to sufficient image quality , the magnetom open is suitable for interventions on the breast .    2.261288820064142
children with limb deficiencies or amputations of the lower extremities should be enabled to stand or to walk according to their state of development , because just standing and walking are among the most important preconditions for the best possible integration .    2.245114882931145
supply them with a prosthesis , orthesis and UNK is therefore indispensable for rehabilitation .    2.5617778491484033
while a prosthesis UNK parts of the extremities , orthesis stabilizes the existing extremity .    2.517715704066085
UNK compensate longitudinal malformations , have a supporting effect , allow growth to be controlled and compensate for shortening .    2.1616310593626737
just as important as the UNK is early medical treatment .    3.1312245057568613
the sooner the treatment starts , the better the results .    2.307957257096107
as a result of the present experiences with the UNK application of nitric oxide ( no ) in term babies now the first promising reports about no application in preterm babies have been published .    2.3831537139610384
hiv remains infectious at room temperature for about six to twelve hours under sterile conditions , the time is shorter in the presence of bacteria and when clotting occurs .    2.2700754022550034
hiv infectivity is easily destroyed by UNK .    2.4469060962488913
the human infectious dose of hiv is around 100 to 1000 particles , dependent on the virus and the site of entry into the host .    2.2201957746833987
after inoculation new hiv is produced after 24 hours , and hiv has spread over the whole organism by the end of one or two weeks .    2.4286250768773434
hiv infection may be detected after four to twelve weeks by antibody assays , and after eleven days by nucleic acid based assays .    2.202607561312062
anti - hiv production might be slowed down under initial therapy .    2.1180995427122284
in addition to psychiatric outpatient treatment , the detoxification of alcoholics in psychiatric hospitals is an important link between medical detoxification and psychosocial inpatient treatment aiming at abstinence .    2.1398665534532157
integrated models of inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy focus on improvement of the motivation of patients towards further treatment of their alcoholism and towards abstinence .    2.181600651795338
in our study UNK alcoholics underwent such treatment lasting between 2 to 3 weeks .    2.172493227250466
a total of UNK patients ( 89 % ) were followed up after 8 months ; 242 alcoholics ( 52 % of the follow - up sample ; 46 % of the whole sample ) achieved the treatment goal and started further treatment , mainly as inpatients .    2.81093835122436
fifty - four of these patients relapsed before they started further alcoholism treatment , but achieved abstinence afterwards ; 60 ( 25 % ) of these 242 patients relapsed after the specific alcoholism therapy ; UNK alcoholics did not start further treatment after the initial detoxification and motivation therapy .    2.092017316004415
in this UNK , 113 ( 50 % ) relapsed during the follow - up period .    2.5827227977602885
although this is not a controlled study , it can be concluded that integrated inpatient detoxification and motivation therapy has positive effects on the treatment behavior of alcoholic patients and enhances the probability of further abstinence .    2.4432337238338673
in this article we report a very rare case of simultaneous and bilateral rupture of the quadriceps tendon in a 38 - year - old patient .    2.7529253405730127
the initial diagnosis was " UNK vertebral disk " .    2.422554168059414
although there was an extensive neurological and psychiatric examination in combination with several operations , it took almost 3 months until the real reason was found .    2.2802785393244416
in this case report we describe our postoperative treatment of early mobilization and compare it with other therapies .    2.2625849402152003
neuroendocrine tumors of the thymus , also known as thymic UNK , are rare tumors of the anterior mediastinum .    3.415332063378431
they occur sporadically or in association with the men i syndrome .    2.483092713266835
we present five patients ( four male , one female ; age of first manifestation 19 - 53 years ) who were operated on at our hospital between 1984 and 1995 for neuroendocrine thymic tumors .    2.268439211478334
a hormone - producing tumor presented with UNK ' s syndrome in two patients .    2.9610476753653816
two patients had men i syndrome .    2.55082861358625
only in the female patient the primary tumor was confined to the thymus .    2.898703772957348
we found lymph node metastases in three patients and a distant metastasis in one .    2.713446700865007
since there was no operative mortality and adjuvant therapies are of limited value , we recommend surgery even in case of recurrence .    2.7733619976045394
korsakoff ' s psychosis ( wernicke - korsakoff - syndrome ) following severe , long - term alcoholism is considered to be widely resistent to treatment .    2.3469964682394253
we report two cases with beneficial effects of treatment by a combination of clonidine and UNK .    2.7379499670138494
the dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia was based on the UNK blockade of central dopamine d2 receptors .    2.8036672625305155
brain imaging studies , however , generally failed to demonstrate a significant increase in central d2 receptors among schizophrenic patients .    2.835350955676501
using a novel approach , the group of UNK and UNK - UNK was now able to demonstrate that schizophrenic patients have increased synaptic dopamine concentrations in the striatum .    3.183068287997001
a similar increase in d2 binding was also observed in drug - free schizophrenics who had previously been treated with neuroleptics ; these patients also showed an increased density of striatal d2 receptors , most likely due to UNK upregulation of d2 receptors during neuroleptic medication .    2.0954173816313775
the UNK study provides an important indication of UNK function in schizophrenia .    2.622997417562595
multiple and bilateral oncocytomas are rare .    2.5514297796806487
three of these displayed multiple and bilateral oncocytomas and microoncocytomas , a so - called oncocytomatosis .    2.295247796241788
this report describes a case of renal oncocytomatosis found at autopsy .    2.7263194382385825
in addition , we found an adrenal adenoma , a pheochromocytoma and thoracic UNK 4 years after curatively resected large cell carcinoma of the lung .    2.4081921667722797
in the distal renal UNK we found oncocytic epithelial cells , with partial transition into microoncocytomas .    2.355508426316253
immunhistochemically , these and the main oncocytomas were cd 10 negative .    2.1851780109845405
these findings support the origin of oncocytoma from UNK transformed distal tubular epithelium .    2.2735317207354364
cgh analysis of the different tumors revealed no common cytogenetic changes .    3.1405425834694594
coexistence of renal oncocytoma with other tumors is rare .    2.3367640696671144
hitherto , coexistence of a renal oncocytomatosis with multiple tumors has not been described .    2.4035859255513614
thyroid disorders in childhood needing surgery are rare .    2.4940069014331434
therapeutical procedures therefore are derived from adult surgery with modifications to meet the specific need of the pediatric patient .    2.177798844112403
the indications for operation are presented with regard to incidence and type of the defect , and the surgical procedures with regard to the extent of the lesion results .    3.7667916155195975
malignant bone tumors require the same careful staging as , for example , lung cancer .    2.704546055496629
however , well - established staging systems for non - osseous tumors are not suitable for bone tumors .    2.554594603318289
therefore we present enneking ' s staging system for malign bone tumors here , which is better adapted to the special problems of these entities because it integrates clinical , radiological and histological findings .    2.3272813623122115
the weak points of enneking ' s staging system ( e . g .    2.127402495287716
UNK , changes in radiological modalities in the past 20 years ) are discussed .    2.9981189098457524
efficient analgesia may be the major objective in the cardiovascular risk patient following myocardial infarction , acute occlusion of peripheral vessels , or dissection / perforation of major abdominal vessels .    2.2165099344840113
it was the purpose of the study to investigate the haemodynamic and respiratory side effects of eight different opioids in 57 circulatory risk patients prior to major vascular surgery .    2.8183506993894207
patients were randomly allocated to eight groups , each receiving a different opioid within a clinical , equipotent dose range ( buprenorphine , fentanyl , morphine , nalbuphine , pentazocine , pethidine , tramadol , alfentanil ) .    1.8329130839204748
a complete haemodynamic and blood gas status was obtained prior to as well as 5 , 10 , 15 , and 20 min following opioid administration .    2.5688109923886295
monitoring included a complete invasive haemodynamic and blood gas status .    2.314425158010844
statistical evaluation was performed by 1 - and 2 - factorial anova ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.392641122304111
significant time effects ( changes from baseline at the time of measurement ) were observed for heart rate and total peripheral resistance , while significant group ( group - specific differences in the course of values at the different times of measurements ) and time effects were noted for mean pulmonary artery pressure , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure , stroke volume index , and pao2 .    2.248463987397906
no major effects were observed following morphine , fentanyl , alfentanil , tramadol , and nalbuphine .    2.5817600751487673
buprenorphine caused distinct respiratory depression accompanied by an increase in pulmonary vascular tone .    2.6362794078771614
pentazocine and pethidine caused a significant increase in UNK and peripheral vascular resistance while pethidine also produced marked respiratory depression .    2.4401362337473254
for interpretation of the results , factors such as respiratory depression , histamine release , secretion of endogenous catecholamines , and hypoxia - induced pulmonary vasoconstriction have to be discussed .    2.472202685317171
tramadol , an opioid with moderate potency , seems to offer some advantages due to its minor cardiovascular and respiratory side effects .    2.337250815927978
in this article we report a case of an early postoperative compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial compartment with complete sensomotoric palsy of the peroneal nerve after arthroscopic - assisted replacement of the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) of the knee .    2.641559462742406
the tourniquet pressure was 360 mm hg and operation time was 1 . 75 h . after the operation the leg was UNK to avoid swelling of the leg and as antithrombotic prophylaxis .    2.6217213289980585
analgesic therapy was by continuous epidural bupivacaine infusion .    2.4521649302614428
increasing pain of the lower leg was suppressed by additional analgesia .    2.7869765379924303
due to persistent pain despite regular analgesia , the patient was sent to a main hospital on the 3rd postoperative day , where an extremely painful and swollen anterior tibial compartment with UNK pressure of over 100 mm hg was found .    2.1892619365851202
despite the appearance of severe muscle damage , no extensive débridement was done .    2.5101055125733613
at the second examination , at 48 h , there was minimal perfusion of the muscles without contraction and islands of ischemic necrosis .    2.218512811433826
clinically , there was complete palsy of the UNK of the foot .    3.981701340885396
the case shows the danger of a compartment syndrome when tourniquet of the limb , arthroscopy and a firm bandage are combined .    2.1559888249463444
continuous epidural analgesia UNK the classic symptoms of compartment syndrome .    2.3470304181242305
the influence of biomechanics in surgery of the locomotor apparatus has been constantly increasing over the last few decades .    2.405369118671681
the purpose of this study was to determine wether biomechanical studies can significantly influence therapy and treatment of shoulder injuries , especially shoulder instability .    2.334366042293023
the investigation was performed on 23 fresh human specimens with intact capsular ligaments of the glenohumeral joint .    2.2335097686162904
a bankart lesion from 3 o ' clock to 6 o ' clock was repaired , and a bankart repair and anterior inferior capsular shift , as described by neer , were performed .    2.0908106628125274
the measurement was done on six clinically relevant positions of instability : superior , anterior , anterior - inferior , inferior , posterior - inferior , posterior .    2.0125230414475483
measurement was done using a specially developed strain - gauge system .    2.3142114594727237
it was demonstrated that both instability and too much stability of the shoulder joint lead to a significant change in shoulder biomechanics .    2.7242648735072454
the anatomical 0 - position of the glenohumeral joint in 110 ° of abduction is a position of about 60 ° of external rotation compared to the 0 - position for clinical measurement .    2.4460251714055996
from the therapy point of view , one has to ask for anatomical reconstruction instead of tight repair in soft - tissue repair in the glenohumeral joint .    2.2308188513928857
immediate post - operative rehabilitation in a 60 ° range of motion is possible .    2.6923090568221175
a total of 61 patients suffering from weight loss and epigastric pain were screened by color flow duplex imaging ( cfdj ) of the abdominal vessels .    2.5400068378494276
criteria for diagnosis were ( 1 ) peak flow in the celiac axis ( ca ) of more than 200 cm / s ; ( 2 ) fixing of the ca stenosis during expiration and inspiration , and ( 3 ) steal phenomenon and reversal of flow in the superior mesenteric artery ( sma ) .    2.4113806231668873
results : of 61 patients 21 ( 34 . 4 % ) fulfilled the criteria ; 38 ( 62 . 3 % ) were excluded , and 2 patients could not be evaluated .    2.8977519151010553
of 21 patients 10 were operated on after confirming diagnosis by angiography of ca and sma .    2.3779445882026624
after a follow - up of 28 months 80 % of the operated patients were free of symptoms , 10 % improved , and 10 % showed no change .    3.286782885219238
conclusion : successful operative treatment of ca compression includes ( 1 ) cfdj of ca and sma proving stenosis persisting in UNK position of the diaphragm ; ( 2 ) angiography of ca and sma showing a steal phenomenon including blood flow reversal in sma ; ( 3 ) triad of symptoms : epigastric pain , UNK pain and weight loss ; and ( 4 ) exclusion of other causes , i . e .    2.207186484607854
pancreatic cancer , pancreatitis etc .    2.6944585071718326
extremely radical and radical surgical treatment of breast cancer was investigated with regard to indication , prognosis and local recurrence in comparison to current standard breast - conserving procedures .    2.961868689391293
plastic - reconstructive techniques and innovative therapeutical approaches such as preoperative chemotherapy can extend the indications for breast - conserving therapy without loss of oncological safety .    2.2404997155206794
choosing individually various oncoplastic techniques such as glandular adaptation , local or distant flaps or mammoplasty permits breast remodeling with excellent cosmetic results .    1.912095681318975
we present the variety of UNK techniques and local flaps that enable the breast surgeon to achieve good symmetry and breast shape with minimal surgery and scarring .    2.1225506292846217
lesions detected in the white matter by t2 - weighted mri are often inadvertently attributed to multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .    2.2830492693766233
patients with rheumatic diseases are commonly treated as an outpatient in their local environment or are referred to specialized centers .    2.2857390377874434
two recently founded daypatient clinics in berlin and frankfurt / UNK - main ( germany ) for patients suffering from rheumatic diseases will be evaluated for their medical outcome and cost - effectivness of comprehensive treatment of ra patients in stages of high inflammatory activity and progressive disability .    2.0261884898595395
the case - control study design with matched pairs within the network of collaborative arthritis centers will be used to compare daypatient and inpatient treatment .    2.0349522948036367
the paper contains a review of studies published in english or german language dealing with daypatient treatment of ra patients .    2.194809065943816
a case of atrial ectopic tachycardia in an infant probably caused by a small tumor in the interatrial septum is presented .    2.45212900205547
the arrhythmia was successfully treated with amiodarone .    2.8476374886327833
several histologic abnormalities are known to cause aet , but an intracardiac tumor detectable by two - dimensional echocardiography is extremely rare .    2.252010867856874
aet - especially in childhood - as well as cardiac tumors show a tendency to regression , so that even in this case medical treatment should be the first therapeutic choice .    3.0457813645645735
interventional or surgical treatment is required just for those patients with aet that is resistant to medical treatment or UNK after finishing the medical treatment .    2.4028276714258663
tonsure trichotillomania is a subtype of trichotillomania in which the scalp exhibits a UNK pattern of alopecia over the UNK , extending to the frontal margin and sparing the lateral margins and the UNK of the neck .    2.78185634307226
it differs from to the more common form of childhood trichotillomania in that predominantly female adolescents are affected and its incidence is related to quite severely pathologic psychodynamics , often with a disturbed relationship to female sexuality .    1.9449136245495753
the treating physician should be more UNK in assessing the prognosis ; hair UNK often continues for years .    2.2141298098543842
the aim of the following study was to develop an osteoporotic model by means of ovariectomy .    3.1164002583562858
bone mineral density of the upper and lower jaw was measured by dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( UNK ) before and after ovariectomy .    3.010223991144044
histomorphometric measurements were done by a UNK system .    3.4608603368034334
bone mineral density decreased significantly after ovariectomy in the upper and lower jaw .    2.5479090539188296
there is evidence for the community effectiveness of preventive geriatric intervention programs prior to the need for help or long - term care from a couple of prospective randomized controlled trials ( UNK ) .    2.5152554906686038
for geriatric rehabilitation programs tailored to older people with imminent or manifest need for long - term care analogous - evidence is still lacking .    2.1841122592505506
the nation - wide leading boards of the frg ' s sickness insurance administration in conjunction with its central medical service have formulated guidelines for the formation of a nation - wide ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to realize the postulate of the long - term care insurance legislation " rehabilitation prior to long - term care " .    2.1171953223706423
these guidelines must be proven empirically .    2.5132637915226015
to prove the effectiveness and efficiency of the UNK ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service , the UNK design would be highly desirable .    3.0650192838539416
unfortunately , the prerequisites in the field of methodology are poor since valid , reproducible and feasible criteria for the selection of suitable patients and measurement criteria which meet the requirement of proven medium - term sensitivity to change do not yet exist .    2.1542529557660397
nevertheless , there is a great and urgent need , for the first time , to investigate the cost - effectiveness ratio for this ambulatory geriatric rehabilitation service to be established in the frg , leaving aside the methodologic UNK of randomized control - groups .    2.42389637282121
" idiopathic " ventricular tachycardia is an exclusion diagnosis .    2.376503488649722
recent investigations showed a high prevalence of morphological abnormalities in the right ventricle of patients with " idiopathic " ventricular tachycardia out of the right ventricular outflow tract , which could often be correlated with the origin of the ventricular tachycardia .    3.0911573046445215
these described abnormalities were not uniform .    2.5450666367919115
here we report about a patient suffering from drug - refractory " idiopathic " ventricular tachycardia for 10 years .    2.3264234642647503
this is the first report in which the origin of an " idiopathic " ventricular tachycardia could be localized by right - ventricular angiography , magnetic resonance tomography and electrophysiological study in the area of an interventricular septal thickening of the right ventricular outflow tract and cured by radiofrequency catheter ablation .    2.4256511958999436
fetal teratomas are extra - or UNK congenital malformations with different localization .    2.4087778612692556
although they are rare , they may provoke severe obstetrical complications if they are not prenatally diagnosed .    2.5077821943682785
if sonographic examination of fetal teratomas is performed , it is necessary to evaluate the further development of pregnancy for fetal outcome and pregnancy aspects in relationship to the localization , size and ultrasound criteria of the tumor .    2.6158166197525894
sonographic findings reveal the criteria and conditions for conservative or invasive management or reasons for continuing or terminating the pregnancy .    2.0408489911542667
prenatal ultrasound examination is the only possibility to reduce perinatal morbidity and mortality , as exemplified by 8 prenatally examined fetal teratomas .    2.402155414687168
we report on a 62 - year - old female patient with melena in which polypoid lesions of the cecum were discovered endoscopically .    2.316641414488141
histological examination of mucosal biopsies revealed an inflammatory process with UNK of histiocytes and so - called UNK - UNK bodies , leading to the diagnosis of a malakoplakia of the colon .    3.054230865253444
no other organs were found affected .    2.63257906648553
in the course of an antibiotic therapy , there was no melena detectable over a period of six months .    2.985574799625864
malakoplakia , an inflammation usually affecting the urogenital tract , is rarely found in the colon , with only 35 cases published until now .    2.36130307927239
it is frequently associated with other diseases like neoplastic or inflammatory disorders , immune defect syndromes or heroin abuse .    2.087505687620057
this spectrum is expanded by our report in which a long - standing alcohol abuse was found as an UNK disease .    2.64966571293303
unilateral UNK exanthem a ( ule ) is a self - limited , probably infectious - allergic skin disease UNK affecting small children .    2.282158220255028
we describe five such cases .    2.5212660934321622
the typical unilaterally located or at least unilaterally dominant exanthem usually starts in the axillary region and is characterized by red , partly confluent papules and fine scales .    2.0961044268558284
two of the children presented with atypical manifestations of ule .    2.5986112207470486
due to its asymptomatic course , therapy is not necessary in the majority of cases .    3.037939804556738
minimally invasive adrenalectomy is now an accepted alternative to conventional adrenalectomy .    2.4712000292623015
as in open surgery , several different endoscopic approaches to the adrenal glands have been described .    2.4206647403951203
all adrenal tumors - pheochromocytomas included - except adrenal carcinomas can be removed endoscopically .    1.9615446570263049
however , the use of these techniques is limited in patients with particularly large tumors .    3.3967521858612364
the results reported to date are convincing .    2.6330146132326955
only limited data are available as yet to compare conventional and endoscopic adrenalectomy .    2.438120482925379
because adrenal diseases requiring surgery are rare , endoscopic adrenalectomy is an operation that , for the present , will be limited to centers with a particular interest in laparoscopic and endocrine surgery .    2.4609391337612934
economic evaluations have become more and more important in the UNK field .    3.3608925999659696
this survey ' s objective was to examine if the current economic evaluation techniques can be applied to psychotherapy .    2.483718375225582
8 data UNK , 17 key words from the psychotherapeutic field and 14 economic key words were used , the identified original studies were classified in accordance with UNK , the methodical quality of each study was assessed at a score between 0 and 10 points .    2.2598246302346126
21 studies were found : 16 cost - benefit analyses , 4 cost - effectiveness analyses and one cost - utility analysis .    2.1295565169093704
the quality of the representation of the clinical results ( mean value 8 . 6 ) was better than that of the economic results ( mean value 6 . 1 ) .    2.9216418907424035
it was perfectly possible to evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions with regard to economic aspects by means of the current techniques but in most cases there was a considerable lack of quality in both representation and calculation .    2.749955409081134
furthermore the evaluation type of cost - utility analysis , which is the only one that takes quality of life aspects into consideration and UNK seems to be the most appropriate approach regarding the psychotherapeutic field , has been greatly UNK .    2.702709456009586
as a net effect of ace - inhibitors and at1 - receptor antagonists on the renin - angiotensin system ( ras ) UNK due to UNK ( reduction of blood pressure , afterload reduction ) , antiproliferative ( reduced cell growth , reduction of " vascular " UNK " ventricular remodeling " , reduced formation of extracellular matrix ) , as well as UNK actions and due to the stimulating effect on natriuresis , reduction of blood pressure , preload reduction can be expected .    2.4754739969449817
these aims of therapy have mostly been confirmed for the action of ace - inhibitors by experimental and clinical studies but except for the treatment of arterial hypertension and few preliminary reports concerning the treatment of cardiac dysfunction , no comparable data are available for at1 - receptor antagonists .    2.688996240619479
to date , an antithrombotic and UNK action could only be demonstrated for ace - inhibitors .    2.442914938044089
this effect has been discussed to be responsible for the improvement of long - term prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease .    3.27387774439756
this respective side - effect can be prevented by the use of at1 - receptor antagonists .    2.932418909146681
it has been discussed whether the incomplete action of ace - inhibitors on at1 - receptor - mediated effects is at least in part responsible for the efficacy of this drug which is relatively high ( 75 - 80 % ) as compared to other substances .    2.676137543268721
due to their direct action , at1 - receptor - blockers might also be of high effectiveness for the treatment of severe heart failure .    2.5530567836011504
a combination of the ace - inhibitor - mediated activation of the kinin - system with the more specific blockade of at1 - receptors by at1 - receptor antagonists might be of benefit and is currently under investigation .    2.18819992883701
an isomorphic response is defined as a nonspecific skin stimulus eliciting a disease - specific skin reaction .    2.3040762317236894
we report on the development of the koebner phenomenon in a 32 year old patient with psoriasis after skin testing with uvb at a dose above 0 , UNK j / cm2 .    2.40600619526793
in addition we describe a 28 years old patient who developed new psoriatic plaques in the areas affected by the virus after a varicella infection .    2.4550458432816393
the presence of nicotine in sweat obtained from smokers and one non - UNK exposed to tobacco smoke after 4 h to 8 days of nicotine - free time was investigated .    2.0799066785466596
following stimulation of the eccrine glands , sweat samples were taken every hour for 6 h . the total nicotine concentrations , i . e .    2.2119821269003377
the sum of nicotine and its metabolites , were determined by radioimmunoassay .    2.3444124392039116
the presence of unchanged nicotine was revealed by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry .    2.189616888616045
up to now there is no specific treatment targeting the ultimate cause of interstitial cystitis ( ic ) , since its pathogenesis and etiology are still unknown .    2.1739049853624377
most studies focussing on oral medication have not been randomized , double - blinded or placebo - controlled .    2.525991353081241
numerous case reports and intent - to - treat trials are lacking a systematic approach and do not meet evidence - based medicine criteria .    2.4061561466008685
differential UNK induced by 2 - UNK - d - glucose ( 2 - dg ) is proving to be a feasible modality for optimizing tumor radiotherapy .    2.908241536423734
our earlier work on ehrlich ascites tumor cells has shown that pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives increases the uptake and phosphorylation of 2 - dg .    2.1155436943566808
moreover , the alteration induced in bioenergetic profile was more UNK and less reversible .    2.1964831063582966
the promising combination of hematoporphyrin derivatives and 2 - dg has been further evaluated in the ehrlich ascites tumor bearing mice for determining the effects on radiotherapeutic response .    2.2326898642291253
solid tumors ( average volume = 0 . 9 + / - 0 . 1 cm3 ) implanted in swiss - UNK strain " a " mice were focally irradiated ( 10 gy ) using UNK teletherapy .    2.28819146655039
tumor bioenergetics was assessed by 31p mr spectroscopy .    2.686804208013735
the uptake and phosphorylation of 2 - dg was observed to be increased following pretreatment with hematoporphyrin derivatives .    2.3736767808654884
upon hematoporphyrin derivatives + 2 - dg treatment followed by UNK , the intracellular ph reduced and a remarkable increase in UNK and inorganic phosphate levels was observed .    2.705109863818597
the present study demonstrates the potential of hematoporphyrin derivative pretreatment in increasing the bioavailability of 2 - dg in a mice ehrlich ascites tumor model .    2.2034661511947693
the finding may have interesting clinical implications in the form of increased manifestation of the radiation - induced damage in the case of use of these drugs as a potential adjuvant in radiotherapy of tumors .    2.6239816657111925
the novel UNK ( UNK ) by the german author , social UNK and physician georg büchner ( 1813 - UNK ) can be regarded as a prominent document in the history of medicine .    2.8363171837384886
on the one hand , büchner ' s description of a schizophrenic disorder meets recent criteria ; on the other , he hints at the physician ' s modern general attitude toward the patient .    2.2374481797366816
the latter is derived from his UNK of art and political motives .    2.261542886763311
the hypothesis is discussed that a dysfunction of the descending antinociceptive system may UNK the pain of fibromyalgia .    2.4117065045667174
data from animal UNK show that an interruption of the system by spinal cord cooling leads to ( 1 ) increase in ongoing activity , ( 2 ) lowering in stimulation threshold , and ( 3 ) increase in response magnitude in nociceptive dorsal horn neurons .    2.397024002541775
the influence of the descending system was stronger on the responses to input from deep nociceptors than to input from cutaneous nociceptors .    2.08729318623462
if similar changes occur also in patients , an impairment of the UNK active descending system should be followed by ( 1 ) spontaneous pain ( ongoing activity ) , ( 2 ) UNK ( lowering in mechanical threshold ) , and ( 3 ) hyperalgesia ( increased responses to noxious stimuli ) .    2.723960750339427
these changes should affect mainly deep pain , because the antinociceptive system influences predominantly input from deep nociceptors .    2.131377889132975
animal experiments with microbiologic examinations and studies in cell cultures have shown that ionomer cement is a biocompatible and UNK bone replacement material in the head and neck region .    2.147272004901634
clinical and functional results of its use in the human middle ear have proven to be satisfactory during a maximal period of 2 . 5 years observation .    2.845093988598324
the present trial was continued in order to determine the long - term behavior of ionomer cement ( UNK partial and total ossicles ) after reconstruction of the ossicular chain .    2.7363916504416195
the ossicular chain was reconstructed in UNK cases and included various losses of one or more of the ossicles ( i . e . , incus , incus and malleus , incus and stapes superstructure , and malleus , incus and stapes superstructure ) .    2.089891450821346
follow - up extended over a maximum period of 5 . 5 years .    2.9611023814919544
patients were examined under a surgical microscope and a pure - tone UNK was performed at regular intervals .    2.5119931881984865
preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) is not presently performed in germany .    2.3597580527686133
according to pgd ' s UNK there , existing laws for the protection of embryos UNK this type of diagnostics .    2.4130878570354333
UNK feel that these laws do not stand in the way of pgd , depending on legal viewpoint .    2.1944303507404017
the nature of this longstanding , emotional discussion is not easy to describe to scientists abroad .    2.2585297054996407
this retrospective study investigated the stability of the small ao external fixator in a radioradial configuration used in the treatment of 42 mostly unstable distal radius fractures ( types a - 3 . 2 , c - 1 . 2 and c - 2 . 1 according to the ao classification ) .    3.007166353471569
no bone grafting was performed .    2.8211264915221212
all cases were documented with antero - posterior and lateral x - rays preoperatively , 0 , 2 and 6 weeks postoperatively and after consolidation .    2.3981957477067235
early functional aftertreatment was started one week after surgery .    2.460797347150249
thirty - six fractures showed a dorsal comminution , combined with osteopenia in 18 cases .    2.373704318540887
the mean preoperative radial angle of 17 ° was normalized to 25 ° postoperatively .    2.0341085707606856
the mean preoperative volar angle of UNK 30 ° was reduced to 12 ° postoperatively .    2.1934476425004252
none of these mean angles changed until consolidation .    2.3922989852789485
the external fixator was removed on average after 7 weeks ( range 6 - 10 weeks ) depending on the radiological fracture healing .    2.549649741111068
the small ao external fixator in a radioradial configuration proved to be stable enough for early functional aftertreatment of the wrist .    2.2283646370515364
its stability is related to a proper operative technique and correct indication ( unstable colles type with one or two distal fragments ) .    2.2705773066992414
bone grafting is unnecessary if the external fixator is left in situ until bony consolidation .    2.291360178946991
purpose : to develop and implement a method to obtain digital subtraction ( ds ) spiral computed tomography angiograms ( scta ) in order to avoid UNK of bony structures and vascular calcifications on scta maximum intensity projections ( UNK ) and UNK surface display ( ssd ) .    2.1481419013990606
numerous publications have established that hyperosmolar saline solution can restore arterial blood pressure , cardiac index and oxygen delivery as well as organ perfusion to pre - shock values .    2.4690626948824814
most prehospital studies failed to yield conclusive results with respect to a reduction in overall mortality .    2.6446430500064415
moreover , small - volume resuscitation appears to be of specific impact in patients suffering from head injuries with increased icp and in UNK trauma requiring immediate surgical intervention .    2.485399794997333
the utility of electron beam computed tomography ( ebt ) to estimate cerebral blood volume ( cbv ) and cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) was evaluated .    2.3162206165186188
eleven patients with suspected acute cerebral ischemia were investigated .    2.744012750081821
the ebt was performed with an acquisition time of 50 ms per slice at eight parallel levels .    2.202659731866901
to compare signal / noise and contrast / noise ratios the data from the ebt investigation were compared to a similar examination on a spiral ct .    2.3814215425099476
the signal / noise ratio with ebt was about 30 % , the contrast / noise ratio 25 % of that with spiral ct .    2.662408003287352
the absolute values of cbv were 4 . 9 + / - 1 . 2 ml / 100 g ( ebt ) ; cbf was 50 . 5 + / - 7 . 0 ml / 100 g / min in normal contralateral brain tissue .    2.460824427671363
in four patients with proven infarcts on follow - up , the ischemic areas had a cbv ranging from 1 . 7 to 3 . 8 ml / 100 g , while cbf ranged from 9 . 4 to 24 . 5 ml / 100 g / min .    2.5641926765255496
using a bolus injection of contrast material , calculation of absolute cbv and cbf is feasible using ebt .    2.1407941429936854
advantages of ebt are the absolute measurements possible and it ' s multislice capability .    2.254983630021041
disadvantages , however , are caused by the high image noise , limiting the demarcation of ischemic tissue .    2.8437345949123944
the report , in two parts , sums up the findings of a survey covering 52 cities in central europe .    2.334015164394719
most administrations have imposed a ban on feeding street UNK , but this has been more or less unsuccessful .    2.3672948813767762
information campaigns were used on a large scale , along with more controversial methods such as catching the UNK or shooting them down , providing UNK UNK , administering hormone preparations , UNK , and exclusion from buildings .    2.3859633236010587
few attempts were made to reduce the number of breeding places .    3.0939975828271895
population reduction by poisons or natural UNK seems to be negligible .    2.645007484510082
we report a rare case of an accident during which a pedestrian was hit by a car and was UNK through the UNK into the front seat .    2.342716089533721
apart from the high speed ( 100 km / h or more ) the traumatic amputation of both lower legs and the resulting reduced angular UNK mainly contributed to the final position of the pedestrian in the vehicle .    2.1920852328143727
in addition , the low height of the person standing in front of the vehicle is deemed to have been a supporting factor for the course of the accident .    2.4456070542318633
a 41 - year - old woman with severe juvenile diabetes mellitus suffered from UNK hypothermia after loss of UNK in diabetic ketoacidosis .    2.5056778668219857
she was found unconscious , without measurable blood pressure ; the electrocardiogram ( ecg ) showed bradycardia of 30 / min and the rectal temperature was 23 . 7 °c .    1.9777166456227202
the patient received mechanical ventilation , fluid therapy , warmed gastric lavage , and , unfortunately , inotropic medication .    2.2174677526738007
she was transferred to a department of cardiac surgery in order to continue the therapy with cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) .    2.6509080335492956
on arrival , the patient had a rectal temperature of 27 . 3 °c , the ecg showed an absolute arrhythmia with a frequency of 70 / min , and the blood pressure was 63 / 43 mm hg .    2.8943290842521967
we decided to use a rapidly available but not highly invasive UNK hemofiltration technique for slowly rewarming the patient .    2.084783722396686
vascular access was achieved by percutaneous femoral vein cannulation with a UNK catheter .    2.7766883438456778
the hemofiltration system ( gambro UNK - 10 , gambro ab , sweden ) was instituted with a blood flow rate of 200 ml / min .    2.177167783722738
the hemofiltration monitor controls the pumps for filtering and UNK fluid volumes and allows the infusion solutions to be heated up to 40 °c .    1.8549215554442913
sinus rhythm resumed without antiarrhythmic medications at a temperature of 29 . 5 °c , and within 8 h the patient was UNK to 35 . 5 °c .    2.59895918397676
after treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome caused by pneumonia , she was discharged from the intensive care unit to complete treatment with no evidence of any permanent organ damage .    2.5237617237791574
we conclude that hemofiltration may be the method of choice for rewarming deeply hypothermic patients when their circulation is preserved .    2.2673907423437445
under these circumstances , it is preferable to external rewarming techniques , as it avoids the disadvantages of temperature UNK and rewarming shock .    2.555533155131099
rewarming rates of 1 . 5 °c / h seem to be adequate .    3.2605527459440573
hemofiltration systems are more widespread , less invasive , and easier to handle compared to cpb techniques , which should be preferred in situations of prolonged unsuccessful cardiopulmonary resuscitation with cardiac arrest and deep core temperatures .    2.107606555039859
we report an unusual injury of the face caused by the spoke of an automatic UNK umbrella that come loose when the umbrella was opened .    2.358885697690222
due to the shot - like force of the spoke , the left UNK , septum and right wall of the nasal cavity were UNK .    2.4586699809240073
the part with the joint UNK into the maxillary antrum .    2.5240232977809565
in order to remove the spoke , wire UNK had to be used to cuff off the spoke ' s joint inside the surgically opened maxillary sinus .    2.3820250543230244
seven patients with pulmonary metastases of malignant melanoma were treated with inhalation therapy with 36 million iu interleukin - 2 for six months .    2.60025307096644
response rates were 71 , 4 % with 2 patients achieving a complete remission ( cr ) , 2 partial remissions ( pr ) , 1 stable disease ( sd ) , and 2 progressing disease ( pd ) .    2.3453587926488524
therapy was well tolerated with low toxicity .    2.803370720439744
six of the patients developed cough ; one patient was slightly feverish .    3.233174266785928
we conclude that inhalation therapy of lung metastases is a promising addition to the therapeutic arsenal against malignant melanoma .    2.409563936602132
twelve patients with extensive lichen planus , resistant to different regimes of prior external and internal therapy , were treated with puva - bath photochemotherapy ( UNK bath followed by uva irradiation ) using bath water containing 0 , 5 mg / l of 8 - UNK ( 8 - mop ) .    2.247562078391143
in 11 of the 12 patients , the skin lesions showed a significant improvement or even complete remission within six weeks of treatment .    2.715684163118773
in one patient , only limited clinical improvement could be achieved .    2.513058996686448
a mean of 19 , 1 ( sd + / - 3 , 6 ) puva - bath treatments were carried out .    2.766290430367432
the mean cumulative uva - dose given until clearance of the lichen planus was 16 , 7 ( sd + / - 4 , 8 ) j / cm2 .    2.3056508739822426
no side effects were seen except an increased UNK reaction in two patients manifested as slight erythema .    2.5903793272899396
the results of this trial show , that puva - bath photochemotherapy with 8 - mop is an effective therapeutic alternative to all other known therapies in the treatment of extensive , UNK and also hypertrophic - hyperkeratotic lichen planus .    2.4984453541529574
in comparison to oral puva therapy and puva - bath therapy using 4 , 5 ' , 8 - UNK , balneophotochemotherapy with 8 - mop shows an excellent efficiency - side effect correlation .    2.178778681787042
the clearance of the refractive skin lesions by balneophotochemotherapy with 8 - mop demonstrates the superiority of this therapy over all other common therapeutic modalities used for lichen planus .    2.020535658270612
critical illness polyneuropathy ( cip ) may occur in up to 70 % of septic patients and multiple organ failure patients .    2.8900660073269386
typical clinical signs of cip are the difficulty to wean the patient from artificial respiration , a symmetrical UNK UNK / - UNK that is more pronounced in the distal parts of the limbs , reduced or absent deep tendon reflexes , and muscular atrophy .    2.326568531867258
this article describes and discusses the clinical and electrophysiological features and clinical outcomes , UNK concepts , therapeutic implications , and the complex differential diagnosis of cip from a neurological point of view , focusing on disorders of the nervous system and myopathic abnormalities .    2.5803395802857008
the data available in the literature were reviewed and compared to our own findings in order to UNK a clinical definition of cip .    3.148194725902332
it is a particular aim of this work to emphasize the crucial importance of electrophysiological investigation and monitoring in the classification of the nature and extent of neuromuscular disturbances in critically ill patients .    2.4894134296074615
myths about development during midlife are examined in the light of recent research studies .    2.4101101387862474
these studies show clearly , that midlife is a developmental phase of its own , the course of which can only slightly be predicted by previous development .    2.3106328304431685
the assumption of a depressive crisis automatically occuring must be rejected as well as " positive myths " denying the evolving limitations in certain areas of life .    2.1677000202160452
developmental tasks and developmental possibilities are described as well as the clinical concept of a phase - specific " return of the repressed " .    2.539317594886325
possibilities of UNK and psychotherapy with couples during midlife are outlined .    2.671935640153455
the general aspects for the analysis of malalignment of the low tibial region in the three - dimensional space are discussed .    2.5496250370408258
recommendations for clinical and radiological diagnostics prior to low tibial osteotomies are given .    2.503658130508513
closing wedge , opening wedge , dome - shaped , distraction , rotational and step - shaped osteotomies as well as combined procedures are described .    2.2955136635066284
the possibilities of these techniques are pointed out for malalignment after lower leg , pilon and ankle fractures , as well as after trauma of the distal epiphysis of the tibia .    2.6848570838604844
arthroscopy of the ankle is an additional tool for detailed planning of the adequate surgical procedure .    2.471807960596719
the importance of determining an early correction cannot be underestimated .    2.362920305640482
the original reason for using the german " habilitation " degree to mean that a UNK had qualified and could UNK research and teach at a university is no longer really valid , as this is being threatened by its importance to further UNK .    1.9557654536669544
medical faculties must discuss how this development can be UNK .    2.563238099861437
in order to check the current situation , the habilitation degree systems of 36 medical faculties of german universities were compared with the aid of a scoring system .    2.37084953469527
conformity existed only in the demand for a UNK UNK , scientific publications and a lecture on approval .    3.0408420374926073
concerning other criteria for qualification there was decreasing consensus in the following order : habilitation thesis , UNK to teaching , further professional education , participation in UNK , UNK lecture , qualification to teach , scientific activity , broad background in the discipline , and introduction to the UNK .    2.091647421646299
application of the scoring system with a maximum of 33 score points resulted in a mean value of 15 . 2 points and a range from 6 to 29 points .    2.6986676385347255
a significant decrease in the score values occurred with increasing age of the habilitation degree ( p = 0 . 002 ) .    2.751493162620943
even if scoring systems are ambiguous and UNK , our analysis revealed serious differences in the quality of the habilitation degree .    2.792679304493726
presuming that the german habilitation degree should be maintained as a high - level qualification , we developed proposals that might be used to standardize this academic examination .    2.3716827327945085
chronic reduction in uteroplacental blood flow causes intrauterine growth retardation ( iugr ) .    2.1337125886910027
in an animal model fetal umbilical perfusion in experimentally induced iugr was examined .    2.108747376245167
pregnant sheep were instrumented with externally adjustable UNK on the common internal iliac artery to regulate uterine blood flow in the last third of gestation .    2.4948484109182925
flow probes on the uterine arteries and the common umbilical artery provided blood flow measurements .    2.205093770135662
uterine blood flow was restricted in the group destined to become growth retarded whereas uterine blood flow in the equally instrumented controls was allowed to rise normally .    2.246722479964081
when the experiment was terminated and morphometric data were obtained , uterine blood flow in controls was significantly higher than in restricted animals .    2.2614811655223
body weight and UNK index in fetuses of flow - restricted mothers was significantly lower than in controls .    2.3655009611064624
umbilical blood flow in iugr animals was lower than in controls .    2.6999473334038377
the relation between uterine and umbilical blood flow became closer with advancing gestational age .    2.063286208401236
chronic reduction of uterine blood flow in late pregnant sheep causes iugr accompanied by changes in umbilical blood flow which may be due to fetal adaptation .    2.3778987710757638
four hundred and eighty - eight radical UNK prostatectomies ( rrp ) were performed on clinically localized prostate cancer at one institution within 5 years ( 1992 - 1996 ) .    2.1179123054651163
these were then analyzed regarding the migration of pathological tumor stages towards more localized stages .    2.088583586153572
within the observation period , the annual rate of rrp increased by 81 % from 69 to 125 cases .    2.2085527351391576
the authors noted a decline in the occurrence of advanced tumor stages ( 65 . 0 % to 39 . 2 % ) and small cancers ( < 0 . 5 cc : 7 . 2 % to 1 . 6 % ) and an increase in pathological t2 tumors ( 30 . 4 % to 55 . 2 % ) .    3.264069418472162
the rate of positive surgical margins declined from 34 . 7 % to 12 . 8 % ( for all pathological stages ) .    2.528537269234985
these data confirm trends which were observed in the usa with increasing detection and treatment of localized prostate cancer .    2.8223149980056634
prognostic assessment of acute global cerebral UNK following cardiorespiratory arrest UNK high level of clinical and technical diagnostic skills .    2.3276997089620184
statements regarding prognosis of this form of coma can be made only with reference UNK large number of clinical , neurophysiological , biochemical , and cerebral imaging data .    2.4126589933615836
previous research in this field has usually been restricted to only one or a few parameters such as clinical data , eeg findings , evoked potentials or biochemical markers .    2.10856402559837
the present compilation of the various aspects regarding diagnosis and prognosis is intended to define the present state of the art in diagnosis and prognosis of anoxic coma , and also serve as a basis for a multicenter prospective study including all of the relevant data to improve diagnosis and UNK at guidelines for effective UNK of anoxic coma .    2.5107864488292266
in 96 patients ( ductal pancreatic carcinoma , n = 34 ; periampullary carcinoma , n = 43 ; chronic pancreatitis , n = 19 ) the role of ca 19 - 9 in the diagnosis of lesions of the head of the pancreas were evaluated .    2.982058843869094
the sensitivity for ductal pancreatic carcinoma was 73 . 3 % , for periampullary carcinoma 48 . 8 % , and specificity was 63 . 2 % .    2.9962005222229497
UNK antigen was elevated only in every fifth patient .    2.4273830408816313
even when combining the two tumor markers no increase in sensitivity could be observed .    2.1160026125964926
the low specificity of 63 % , which decreased to 33 % in the case of obstructive jaundice , does not allow adequate preoperative differentiation between cancer patients and those with chronic pancreatitis .    2.6756136267965243
in cases of postoperatively elevated ca 19 - 9 level the prognosis is worse than in patients with normal tumor markers .    2.7324002992043965
the management of neuromuscular foot deformities in children and adolescents must be individualized because of differences in etiology and UNK .    2.2901003313152892
if conservative treatment fails or reaches a plateau early soft tissue procedures are recommended .    2.180074540867857
treatment should focus not only at correction of the deformity but also at UNK of muscular balance .    2.335613914666364
early postoperative mobilisation is usually possible provided adequate UNK control is maintained .    2.2066231156697937
regular clinical follow - ups help to minimize postoperative problems .    2.6347961536707185
the general aim should be an optimization of functions and only rarely to achieve a normal foot .    2.479830664801106
the basic principles of management can be described as correction of deformity , stabilization of unstable joints and balance of muscle power .    2.3381519156658177
this study was carried out from 1986 to 1996 to evaluate the technique of UNK epidural endoscopic discectomy in lumbar hernias occupying over 50 % of the radicular canal , foraminal hernias , and hernias invading it entirely .    2.4963394760711544
this minimally invasive arthroscopic technique was applied in patients suffering from degenerative lumbar stenosis between l3 and s1 .    2.284112730245248
the first part of the study dealt with lumbar hernias .    3.1043194097784896
of a total of 222 patients , 175 ( 78 . 82 % ) showed radicular canal invasion ranging between 50 and 90 % .    2.4621743449713334
the disc level was l4 - l5 in 59 % , l5 - s1 in 39 % , and l3 - l4 in 4 % .    2.113320376216553
most of these hernias were lateral extrusions .    2.3829644679336526
however , the study also included protrusions and foraminal hernias , since they were large and technically difficult to operate on .    2.1568447581792105
in terms of distribution , 25 patients ( 14 . 28 % ) had protrusions and 120 ( 68 . 57 % ) extrusions , and in 30 patients ( 17 . 14 % ) hernias had UNK .    2.8712673249041165
surgery was carried out by the UNK posterior approach through the UNK ligament .    3.2096983263117576
an irrigation pump was used and the structures were under permanent accurate arthroscopic visualization .    2.072357813863136
good results were obtained in 96 % , fair in 3 % , and poor in 1 % .    2.997041668551369
the second part of the study dealt with lateral stenosis .    3.0357482052247784
drawing from the experience gained by experiments performed in 1993 on five cadavers and by UNK epidural endoscopy since 1986 , this surgical technique was designed to provide decompression by resection of the ventral zone of the articular facet and , in some cases , UNK .    2.272766632916887
of the 19 patients treated , nine presented with pathology in one segment , nine in two segments , and one in three segments .    2.2323365641456605
all had lumbar and sciatic complaints , intermittent neurological claudication and predominantly lateral sensory motor deficit .    1.9404290628220369
the general results were good in 84 % and fair in 16 % .    2.421901552026692
the effects of " care - insurance " on the situation of those in need of home care , is the object of first implementation - studies of sgb xi .    2.3549894050017905
they largely agree on the high level of satisfaction found among those who draw the benefits of the insurance scheme , particularly among those who claim a UNK UNK ; further they largely agree on the low level of influence of the " care - insurance " on changes in the form of nursing .    2.345321242835319
an account of the results of the milieu - oriented " freiburger UNK " , which investigates the effects of " care - insurance " differentiated according to the various types of care - situations , forms the centre of the article .    2.766488088764104
a possible intraoperative complication of laparoscopic cholecystectomy is opening of the gallbladder with subsequent loss of gallstones .    2.429819732233194
we report on a 61 - year - old woman who was UNK with an obscure subhepatic tumor .    2.307967869658392
intraoperatively an abscess was found that had been caused by lost gallstones following after laparoscopic cholecystectomy 3 years previously .    2.3952857587928267
there is a low incidence of late abscesses caused by loss of gallstones , but because of the long latency and unspecific symptoms there may be problems in diagnosis .    2.5879715641618883
taking into consideration possible complications caused by intraoperative loss of gallstones , all concrements should be retrieved , even though there is no indication for changing to an open procedure .    2.2000501747128904
since squamous cell UNK of the penis is rare , prospective trials do not exist .    2.9243325588281994
therefore , new treatment strategies have to be developed .    2.9040474044704294
based on our experience with the treatment of 22 patients with penile squamous cell carcinoma , we describe our therapeutic approaches .    3.2926794180254366
ten patients with superficial disease ( t1 - UNK ) were treated with partial penectomy .    3.2834993302135396
the 3 - year survival rate amounted to 90 % .    3.049138040558819
in patients with extensive disease ( t3 - 4 or n1 - 3 ) a partial or total penectomy was performed .    2.319703888346742
after initial antibiotic therapy for 4 weeks , patients underwent inguinal lymph - node dissection and if the nodes were positive , additional pelvic lymph - node dissection .    2.516608222456118
in patients with UNK inguinal lymph - node metastases surgical resection was performed , covering the wound with a musculocutaneous flap ( UNK fascia lata flap n = 2 ; rectus abdominis flap n = 1 ) .    2.316907638957855
the 3 - year survival rate of patients with t1 - UNK tumours ( n = 4 ) was 67 % and with t3 - UNK - 3 ( n = 8 ) 25 % .    3.3627484234043954
patients with distant metastases received inductive systemic chemotherapy with cisplatin , methotrexate and bleomycin .    2.203744935963991
these results suggest that immediate radical surgery with lymph - node dissection is the best treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the penis .    2.763912147824985
biomechanical investigations in eight specimen elbow joints to test articulated external fixation showed correct extension - flexion joint position between 0 and 120 ° .    1.9673455331463907
the central axis through the radial and ulnar condyles varies less than 3 ° in total .    2.160410771570202
x - ray UNK showed correct articulation in all cases without subluxation .    2.903684517746715
all patients began with physiotherapy on the 3rd day after operation , the range of joint motion was 0 - 30 - 95 ° in all cases , after 6 weeks 0 - 30 - 110 ° .    2.340879299184328
additional articulated external fixation at the elbow joint can be an alternative treatment to long - term UNK of the elbow in cases of complex injury .    3.5970059983441103
how important and UNK are clinical parameters and locoregional failure after radical radiotherapy of oropharyngeal carcinomas for the probability of the occurrence of distant metastases ?    2.6859376720738117
from 1 august 1990 to 1 october 1998 , 139 patients with carcinomas of the oropharynx were treated in a prospective study by radical radiotherapy and evaluated in regard to the clinical parameters reflex - otalgia , predominant structure of tumor growth , t - category , presence of involved lymph nodes , and smoking and drinking habits .    2.308034531029332
twenty - nine patients received a concomitant chemotherapy .    2.7298507666256424
twenty - five out of 139 patients had a planned neck dissection after completion of radiotherapy .    2.451240768546433
ten patients received a salvage operation .    2.872607259326133
the median follow - up time was 24 months ( range , 4 to 74 ) .    2.81706740131555
two - and 5 - year overall survival rates according to kaplan meier were 56 . 1 and 49 . 6 % .    2.541357040712898
the tumors were controlled in 77 / 139 patients ( 55 % ) .    2.3433140755340154
the therapy failed in 62 / 139 patients ( 45 % ) .    2.249517402307479
both groups , 62 patients with locoregional therapy failure and 77 patients with locoregionally controlled tumors , were comparable in regard to performance status ( UNK index ) , age , gender , tnm - categories , histological differentiation , drinking habits , pretherapeutic diagnostics , total dose ( gy ) , and number of simultaneous chemotherapy cycles .    2.2430145647817334
locoregional tumor control was significantly determined by the parameters reflex - otalgia ( p < 0 . UNK ) , predominant growth pattern ( p < 0 . 012 ) , t - category ( p < 0 . 03 ) , and smoking ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    2.7441192643136807
the median survival time of patients with locoregional failure is 17 months .    3.0438525382735677
at this moment 81 % of locoregionally controlled patients are still alive .    2.418519156738865
in 14 / 62 patients ( 23 % ) with locoregional failure , distant metastases were detectable against 4 / 77 ( 5 % ) of locally controlled patients , p < 0 . UNK .    2.5151164613543973
probability of local control and distant metastases , predominantly pulmonary , reached a plateau after 24 months .    2.292055155308586
locoregional tumor control , determined by several clinical parameters , is an important parameter for the probability of the development of distant metastases .    3.2960285923434753
failure of local therapy is caused by the biologic aggressiveness of the tumor .    2.9944740651762913
telemedicine includes all medical activities in diagnosis , therapeutics , or social medicine undertaken by means of an electronic transfer medium , enabling the transmission of visual and acoustic information over long distances to doctors not UNK present at the place of the requested consultation .    2.0066819413385897
the aim of this study was to evaluate the retropatellar pressure , force , and contact area in cases of knee arthroplasty compared to knees without arthroplasty .    2.10856419316793
we examined six leg specimens before and after knee arthroplasty .    2.7059279360706174
the modified UNK fixation was used , and arthroplasty was the genesis i without patellar implant ( UNK .    2.197237897165032
smith & nephew , UNK ) .    2.844557176973018
contact measurements were performed with pressure - sensitive film ( fuji UNK type " super low " ) in 45 ° , 60 ° , 90 ° , and 120 ° knee flexion .    2.156788129531868
the results were evaluated with special software , " pressure imaging and analyzing system UNK - UNK series " .    2.5414220832314554
the leg was UNK in the hip joint and the knee joint was opened from a suprapatellar approach .    3.1623821355609825
the film was placed at a defined area between the facies UNK of the femur and facies UNK of the patella .    3.1905324879327104
instantaneous pressure was measured during a time of 5 - s pressure increase and a further 5 s . a force of 280 n was applied to the quadriceps muscle .    2.4085809097766693
before knee arthroplasty , the contact area measured 154 . 3 mm2 , the average pressure was 1 . 14 mpa , the force 182 . 13 n . after knee arthroplasty , the contact area was 119 . 94 mm2 , the average pressure 1 . 522 mpa , the force 180 . 98 n . following knee arthroplasty the contact area decreased significantly ( p = 0 . UNK ) , and the average ( p = 0 . 0001 ) and maximum pressure ( p = 0 . 0003 ) increased significantly .    2.2073517401750715
the force did not change significantly ( p = 0 . UNK ) .    2.37560829653136
the choice of the knee arthroplasty implant and approach to the knee joint should be considered in order to achieve an increased retropatellar contact area thus preventing smaller contact areas than before knee arthroplasty .    2.6652784141281143
the increased contact area could also prevent increasing retropatellar pressures after knee arthroplasty and further complications .    2.105600552352208
maculopathy occurring in young patients is a challenge in UNK diagnosis .    2.8063972479705974
besides hereditary macular UNK and acquired macular UNK , rare systemic disorders should be considered .    2.155546286797103
histological examination of UNK biopsies ( 2 - 5 mm ) of the synovial membrane of 317 patients were obtained by arthroscopic dissection ; in 70 % of all cases non - specific changes were revealed and in 30 % specific changes .    2.7746533301760032
the findings included different stages of proliferation of the superficial layer , uncharacteristic inflammatory reactions of the stratum UNK and fibrosis of the stroma , vascular proliferation and UNK thickening of the synovial membrane .    2.266219039243527
the histomorphological findings can only be interpreted reliably and a pathogenetic classification obtained , e . g . , UNK UNK , rheumatoid arthritis or post - traumatic changes , if the arthroscopic findings conclude an exact documentation of the biopsy site and the clinical findings .    2.6253388009128673
the aim of this study was to determine the impact of prolonged single lung ventilation and intrathoracic insufflation of co2 during computer - enhanced totally endoscopic bypass grafting on biventricular myocardial function .    1.9852367570728646
methods : transesophageal echocardiography was performed intraoperatively in 20 patients undergoing the above mentioned operation .    2.4412574558034557
at distinct time points during the intervention , a cine - loop of both ventricles was registered employing a mid short axis view .    1.9295982309635198
simultaneously , oxygenation parameters as well as electrocardiographic data and intrathoracic co2 pressure were taken .    2.7223272878470963
wall motion analysis was done postoperatively .    2.8384435761482987
results : with increasing duration of single lung ventilation , significant regional and global biventricular hypokinesia was detected .    2.0999502971156256
this was accompanied by a decrease in pao2 and a marked increase in intrathoracic co2 pressure .    2.648014648808411
these alterations disappeared after weaning from extracorporeal circulation and reconstitution of double lung ventilation .    2.1609714757882585
conclusion : these results show that computer - enhanced coronary artery bypass grafting leads to significant alterations in intraoperative biventricular myocardial function .    2.285425580634806
this can be due to either an impact on oxygenation during single lung ventilation or due to intrathoracic co2 insufflation .    2.2591399081529424
however , in our group , these alteration showed only small clinical relevance .    2.320450002797326
during the last few years the fast development of different laser and laser - like systems for UNK and their one - sided representation in media has led to confusion among UNK and patients .    2.2310617921603466
the object of this review is to give a structured report of different pulsed laser and laser - like systems ( UNK , UNK , long - pulsed UNK - , UNK - and UNK ) that are available in germany , including their side effects and complications . the current status of scientific investigation in this field is discussed .    2.9770447932400788
the purpose of the present study was to increase the free range of motion in conventional trust - plate prosthesis design and to optimize the trust - plate contact as well as the UNK area below the trust - plate .    2.5307606458661676
a few studies have reported familial aggregation and association with hla .    2.4448444114098216
we have studied genetic linkage of fms with hla in UNK families , and found a rather weak linkage of fms with hla ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    1.9827086309159585
malformations of the urinary tract are one of the most common types of anomalies in the neonatal period .    2.6553924725119455
approximately 15 - 20 % of all prenatally detected malformations require acute postnatal imaging .    2.6796408736010533
sonography is the primary imaging modality in the evaluation of UNK - urologic problems in infancy .    3.0109653005049495
hydronephrosis represents the most common pathology , followed by UNK - dysplastic kidney .    3.2362249262571092
discussion : the result of the sonographic examination directs further imaging .    2.7053022296339506
an adequate diagnostic algorithm is decisive for accurate diagnosis , for the appropriate therapeutic regimen and for the prognosis of the patients .    2.803767479182971
calcification is one of the main causes of failure of porcine bioprosthetic heart valves , a problem which has not been satisfactorily solved to date .    2.4957047215786825
previous studies have shown that calcification is decreased in porcine heart valves that have undergone treatment for lipid extraction .    2.1782088267852187
the relation between lipid distribution and calcification of seven new commercially available porcine bioprosthetic heart valves ( st . UNK medical , UNK ) is assessed by sudan red iii staining to show preexisting lipids .    2.1253107192110834
all porcine bioprosthetic valves contained lipids to different degrees .    2.31141857294048
five valves were subjected to the UNK accelerated calcification process for 4 weeks .    2.6523748302563397
distribution and level of calcification were evaluated by radiography and compared to the sudan red - stained fatty areas .    2.607739523209544
comparison of the calcifications detected by radiography and the macroscopically detected lipids showed a coincidence of 57 - 66 % .    2.12845341382422
two porcine bioprosthetic valves were histologically prepared and stained with UNK and von kossa ' s stain , respectively .    2.166175602511299
by light microscopy , the von kossa staining revealed microcalcifications and UNK microscopic investigation showed UNK substances in areas with lipid deposits .    1.9957069845072803
these preexisting substances in porcine valve tissue may play a UNK role in the calcification of the tissue .    2.5628347357433245
substantial studies are necessary to further determine the role of preexisting lipids in calcification .    2.779218021461587
therapy for hip dysplasia and ddh by means of sonography .    2.8188821362134266
numerous methods are available for treating " congenital " dysplasia of the hip ( cdh ) .    2.569443863283112
the important point seems to be the differentiation between dysplastic hip joints with and without displaced femoral heads .    2.7813784134084156
a historical review of the diagnosis of so - called " congenital dysplasia " and dislocation of the hip and different indications for therapeutic maneuvers is given .    2.843540586930766
generally , a three - step plan of treatment is recommended : dislocated heads must be reduced , after which retention is needed until the hip joint is stable .    2.3433199967981424
this is followed by maturation period , until the UNK hyalin UNK performed acetabular roof is ossified .    2.0689450607761533
all hip joints , regardless of age , can be assigned to one of these phases .    2.928143518377593
in all cases , measures are taken to prevent ischemic necrosis of the femoral head .    2.4865822863525984
to prevent the residual dysplasia of the acetabulum roof and femoral head necrosis , the reduction - retention position should be more than 90 ° flexion in the hip joint , but not more than 45 - 50 ° abduction .    2.4636021492881968
in each therapeutic phase there is a different biomechanical situation in the hip joint .    2.711339295755874
the appropriate orthosis for treatment is chosen according to the particular biomechanical situation .    2.7003556815393477
each sonographic type can be set up according to the our classification in the three - phase treatment system .    2.7431210120248397
in this way the adequate orthosis for treatment in each treatment - phase can be chosen .    2.3308254638852084
a case of a patient with malignant acanthosis nigricans in association with carcinoma of the lung is reported , documenting successful palliative treatment of the UNK papillomatous thickening of the lips with electrocautery .    3.066766021067891
molecular atmospheric oxygen contains two unpaired electrons in the unreactive triplet state and thus has to be activated in order to react with other biological molecules in the UNK ground state .    2.414259734046498
these processes of activation include very reactive intermediates .    2.3004600998934577
therefore , aerobic cells must cope with - and to some extent also adapt to - oxidative stress provoked for example by infection or intoxication , where reactive intermediates of oxygen activation accumulate .    1.8652012081131224
depending on the strength of these UNK , several symptoms indicate the deviation from normal , steady - state metabolism .    2.2311633185028996
most of these visible or measurable symptoms are connected with oxygen activation where principally a transition from UNK reactions ( two - electron transitions ) to increased homolytic reactions ( one - electron transitions ) is observed .    1.8264238114084363
homolytic reactions produce free radicals , which are generally UNK by a parallel increase of intrinsic radical scavenging processes or by compounds administered with food , thus UNK metabolic control within certain limits .    2.0971807962133076
finally , cellular UNK yield apoptotic , lytic and / or necrotic processes .    2.4249202578333753
every episode during this cascade is UNK by the balance between pro - and antioxidative capacities .    2.4709526838010993
antioxidants , which in many cases are free radical UNK or UNK of activated states , comprise a wealth of classes of organic molecules including UNK , probably as the most prominent ones .    2.5236510256024935
in this article , mechanisms of oxygen activation and protection from oxidative damage are discussed .    2.1727891106297683
furthermore , examples of antioxidative functions of a few important natural products are reported .    2.1833531710643523
in a UNK prospective randomized double - blind clinical trial the efficacy of homeopathic treatment was investigated on children with adenoid UNK justifying an operation .    2.304506673477629
the duration of the study for each patient was 3 months .    3.4493314194979905
examination of the ears using a microscope , UNK , UNK and UNK , as well as UNK and audiometry were performed after 4 , 8 and 12 weeks .    3.280024114493521
out of a total of 97 children studied between the ages of 4 to 10 years 82 could be analyzed .    2.579798608078452
at the end of the study no operation was required in 70 . 7 % of the placebo - treated children and in 78 . 1 % of the children treated with homeopathic preparations .    3.2137216932129293
these results show no statistical significance .    2.6565177249326477
a treatment technique favorable for UNK with asymmetric jaws , which combined cranio - caudal matching fields with fields enclosing the whole target volume , is investigated with respect to field matching and sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk .    1.8693967699049392
the matching line was measured and calculated with helax tms© .    2.4700566128668213
furthermore a 4 - field UNK and opposing fields were planned .    2.3561129097932474
the dose - volume histograms for target , bladder , intestine and soft tissue were UNK .    2.325815456356014
normal tissue complication probability and tumor control probability , respectively , were calculated for all techniques .    2.318044617830782
in the region of the matching line the UNK of the measured normalized curves resulted in relative dose maxima of 6 . 0 % ( caudal ) and 4 . 5 % ( cranial ) , respectively .    2.6642949665572084
for fields enclosing the whole target volume the dose maxima in the region of the matching line decreased to 2 . 0 % ( caudal ) and 1 . 8 % ( cranial ) , respectively .    2.4686480779934126
for the dose profiles calculated with helax tms© no UNK was found .    2.287653421553334
the 5 - field technique with adjoining fields results in a better sparing of the organs at risk compared to the other techniques , whereas the tumor control remains the same .    2.5988745377891735
in specific cases a technique with cranio - caudal adjoining fields can be recommended with respect to sparing of normal tissue and organs at risk .    2.195706413152401
disseminated langerhans - cell - histiocytosis ( UNK ) is most frequent in children at the age of 1 - 3 years , seldomly seen in adults and extremely rare in the elderly .    2.9566030156603853
the clinical course may be acute , subacute or chronic , progressive or stationary .    2.383319778287319
spontaneous remissions are possible , but rare .    2.6675346873151766
in elderly patients often the disease is at first limited to the skin before it becomes systemic .    2.830225821367568
because of its central location , the elbow joint is considered the most important joint within the upper extremity from the viewpoint of function .    2.589847627115801
trauma to osseous and ligamentous structures of the proximal forearm UNK trauma surgeons and orthopedic specialists with numerous diagnostic and therapeutic challenges .    2.4553602503077077
conditions following elbow trauma are often accompanied by chronic pain and diminished range of motion , leading to functional deficits of the entire arm .    2.592905960960311
there is now practically no doubt that primary osteosynthesis , anatomical joint reconstruction and early onset of functional treatment are essential for a good final outcome .    2.209254720119393
with our expanding knowledge of the anatomical and biomechanical UNK in the proximal lower arm in the last few decades the basic principles of therapy have also changed , and current standards of treatment for proximal forearm trauma are presented in this paper with reference to the relevant literature .    2.756280790982078
the series of five patients with symptomatic isolated right ventricular outflow tract ectopy and no structural heart disease which were successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of the ectopic focus are reported in order to discuss radiofrequency ablation as an alternative treatment in patients with right ventricular outflow tract ectopy without ventricular tachycardia .    2.6366408827201626
basic principles for treating patients with chronic pain are presented .    2.856748650160994
they are the result of a longterm collaboration of UNK from different medical specialties in the pain outpatient unit of the university of ulm .    2.497061971696815
in contrast to a variety of literature on chronic pain patients , these principles focus on the contribution of the therapists to the development of problems in treatment .    2.66063944088888
eight principles , considered especially important for the treatment of chronic pain patients are presented and discussed .    3.245952328224161
we discuss this entity with the aid of a case report and the existing literature .    2.6635896346435115
the therapy of these tumors includes resection and possible adjuvant radiotherapy .    2.5511878079607677
rhabdomyosarcomas are an exception , because they also show a good response to chemotherapy .    2.6283985246357022
14 human UNK were scanned by cat and 3d reconstructed .    2.2943178769923556
with a special software UNK ( orthodoc ) virtual preoperative planning for implantation of a cementless total hip UNK was undertaken .    2.3553842311851163
the specimens were randomised into two groups , one of which had manual and the other one robot implantation of the femoral component .    2.6780462890064896
after implantation all specimens were evaluated again by cat and cct and at angle were documented again .    2.0394844406110058
the preoperative ccd angle was 126 . 7 ° ( sd = 4 . 0 ) in the manual group and 127 . 8 ° ( sd = 4 . 3 ) in the robodoc group .    2.5918395179086935
postoperatively the angle averaged 131 . 9 ° ( sd = 0 . 8 ) in the manual group and UNK . 2 ° ( sd = 1 . 9 ) in the robodoc group .    3.262385719655074
significant differences were found for the at angle in both groups .    2.7310518203213396
the preoperative at angle in the manual group was 31 . 3 ° ( sd = 8 . 8 ) , decreasing to 20 . 5 ° ( sd = 9 . 5 ) after implantation .    2.537777298925406
in the robodoc group this angle was 30 . 9 ° ( sd = 8 . 0 ) before and 31 . 3 ° ( sd = 8 . 7 ) after implantation .    2.401597876070062
the difference between pre - and postoperative at angle averaged 10 . 8 ° ( sd = 6 . 4 ) in the manual group and only 0 . 4 ° ( sd = 0 . 9 ) in the robodoc - group .    3.105230433024995
conclusion : with the technique used , preoperative planning in hip UNK is much more accurate than with the conventional technique with plain x - ray .    2.3651628382111265
the virtual preoperative planning can be transferred to the intraoperative setting with high precision .    2.4114909608984787
these factors may lead to an increase in outcome quality .    3.267728400789472
1000 drug - related fatalities that were examined in hamburg from 1990 - 1996 by the institute of legal medicine were analysed with respect to consumption of substitute drugs such as methadone .    2.326524342606485
the incidence of methadone - related fatalities has increased in the last two years .    3.0951853939239307
the highest incidence was found in 1995 when methadone was detected in the blood of about 20 % of all drug - related fatalities .    2.8997009995830005
lethal UNK or combined intoxications with a dominant role of methadone were experienced rarely ( about 1 % of all drug - related fatalities ) .    2.4200328441907586
of the persons who were enroled since 1990 in a methadone maintenance programme 2 % have been registered as drug - related fatalities .    2.0830329399750758
the mortality of street addicts without comparable medical help was about 10 % in the same period .    2.4967902578946317
pulmonary infections and tumors are a major cause of death in patients with aids .    3.2302547909134964
the combination of clinical , radiological , laboratory , and pathohistological data helps to narrow the spectrum of differential diagnoses or even allows a specific diagnosis in many patients .    2.3074230875045303
nevertheless , an accurate diagnosis should be obtained as soon as possible during the clinical course of the illness to initiate treatment in time .    2.58111586738577
computed tomography ( ct ) has proven to provide promising results in the diagnosis of aids - related thoracic diseases .    2.8293075240875223
the aim of this paper was to demonstrate the diagnostic capacities of ct in the context of particular aids - related thoracic pathologies .    2.4656981796244075
additional information on the spectrum of pathological agents and on differential diagnostic signs is summarized .    2.671255635485582
this study was designed to provide information to which extend home - based nursing care services for the elderly take part in the care for older people with mental disorders .    2.4258312969879214
also of interest was the involvement of clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system in the health care for the clients .    2.3853506825058086
a one day data collection in 29 nursing care services in two north UNK - UNK regions could raise informations about 1 , UNK clients aged 60 years and over 1 , 522 persons ( 41 . 8 % ) had a mental disorder , diagnosed by a nursing and / or medical professional .    2.3763580584522113
68 % of the mental disordered clients had dementia or a UNK disorder , 6 % a functional psychoses , and 31 % a neurotic , UNK disorder or substance abuse ( small number of clients with two and more diagnoses ) .    2.4957778950382887
82 % of clients with mental disorders had one or more additional somatic disease ( s ) .    2.434567022771063
these diseases were mostly the cause for the involvement of home - based nursing care service .    2.5872611837989754
barely 8 % of clients with mental disorders were placed from clinical facilities and services of the geropsychiatric treatment system into the nursing care services .    2.04334653467277
beside the home - based care , only 12 % of mental disordered received clients outpatient psychiatric treatment .    2.2547123971079075
systematic cooperation between the nursing care services and the system of ( UNK - ) psychiatric UNK was a rare exception .    2.8003339035573447
acute cerebral nerve paresis can be caused in many different ways .    2.4649998005798377
one of the more rare causes of paresis of one or more neural pathways is dissection of the internal carotid artery .    2.5225139434770893
early diagnosis is important , even with atypical symptoms , since prompt UNK therapy can hinder stroke from embolism due to the dissection .    2.528698866958602
we report on two patients with UNK ' s syndrome and UNK - UNK syndrome resulting from dissection of the internal carotid artery .    3.128562179617566
besides the cranial and caudal nerves involved in our study , loss of function has also been reported with the UNK to eighth cranial nerves , so that any painful , sudden cranial nerve deficiency can indicate possible carotid dissection .    2.4403028637160955
in addition to direct cell - to - cell contacts and the modifying influences of the intercellular matrix , soluble mediators play an important role in intercellular communication .    2.1944867363949503
cytokines exert their effects by binding with specific receptors that transfer their signals to individual cells .    2.0289743360170935
a common structure shared by subunits of these receptors leads to competitive inhibition in binding the cytokines with different affinity .    1.943935918494883
by this mechanism specificity is reduced , on the one hand ; however , on the other the complexity of interactions in the bone marrow is enhanced .    2.969001263850172
a UNK of in vitro and in vivo studies have established the impact of various cytokines on single hematopoietic cell lineages and their application for clinical use .    2.3543568787729825
however , there is a lack of knowledge concerning the cellular origin of the cytokines .    2.7682229556642346
according to the results of our studies elements of the UNK - and megakaryopoiesis are the source of cytokines like il - 1 , il - 3 , il - 6 , and gm - csf .    3.486733597967858
wound healing represents a dynamic process of increasing scientific interest , especially with the detection of the different growth factors .    2.764869024528684
economic aspects are also of importance in the investigation of substances used for wound healing .    2.6969652133075264
in germany 25 % of all patients ( ca .    3.364723949458048
1 million ) with severe chronic venous insufficiency have crural ulcers .    2.4146187900862155
the influence of bacterial infection of crural ulcers is controversial .    2.3912292569000577
there is no doubt that the quantity of bacteria is of importance .    2.4554208951710224
local antibiotic treatment is difficult , as most of the substances used are known to inhibit wound healing .    3.0780998389474807
in vivo and in vitro investigations showed , that chiniofon - containing antiseptic has a bacteriostatic function .    2.237615070212037
additionally it was shown , using cultures of fibroblasts , that chiniofon - containing antiseptic does not inhibit the growth of fibroblasts , whereas UNK - iodine solution , a widely used antiseptic , clearly reduces the growth of fibroblasts .    2.1323134357007514
the good clinical results in the treatment of acute and chronic radiation damage indicate that chiniofon - containing antiseptic may have UNK activity .    2.6095924570229205
this article presents the heuristics concerning description of individual generative behavior .    2.0648946564506043
the aim is to describe the development of the desire for children , the generative action and the dealing with generative decisions for intended and unintended UNK women and men as well as parents .    2.4410637876278365
the main emphasis of the existing heuristics is placed on psychological questions .    2.2292991335894525
these heuristics explain patterns and influencing factors of generative action as well as positive and negative influencing factors of the coping process .    2.668297405871133
it may be helpful to use heuristics which describe development of and coping with generative action as background information to ensure comprehensive consultation and therapy planning .    2.0486544785737424
morbus parkinson is a progressive degenerative disease of the human central , peripheral , and enteric nervous systems .    2.4600895104867746
in the course of the disease , not only the substantia nigra , but also UNK components of the motor system , as well as numerous limbic system and autonomic centers undergo serious damage .    2.612652302569972
accordingly , parkinson ' s disease is a multisystem disorder .    2.713340359987761
only specific types of projection neurons fall victim to it .    2.138585060821197
the first manifestation of the pathological process which causes the disease are abnormalities of the neuronal cytoskeleton .    2.4994781705929543
intracytoplasmic inclusions evolving in the form of lewy bodies in UNK and lewy UNK in the neuronal processes result in premature cell death of the affected neurons .    2.6180512612561158
on the basis of this selective neuronal vulnerability , a UNK emerges of the pathological changes within the nervous system and corresponding functional impairments .    2.3317661000058028
introduction : children with " nursing bottle syndrome " and long standing teeth UNK and no treatment so far were examined for accompanying pathological changes in the bacterial flora of the mouth and alterations due to chronic inflammation of the oral mucosa and the alveolar UNK .    2.197242764813616
osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone marrow caused by both non - specific and specific agents .    3.0041908007173737
non - specific endogenic osteomyelitis represents the most frequent form , followed by the specific form caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis infection .    2.8007368932517926
typically , the non - specific form occurs in children and young adults , and the sites most frequently affected are the distal and the proximal ends of the tibia and femur .    3.0368647003050095
in tuberculosis , osteomyelitis is predominantly located in the vertebral bodies .    2.6669026625860073
in rare cases osteomyelitis can be caused by viruses , fungi or echinococcus .    2.4494203037656868
it may also occur as so - called acute endogenic osteomyelitis , such as UNK osteomyelitis and UNK ' s abscess .    3.0824394163967006
histologically , dense infiltration of leucocytes , granulation tissue and bone UNK can be seen .    2.6757994097627935
in tuberculosis granulomas with central necrosis , epithelioid cells and giant cells of UNK type are characteristically found .    1.9660182204785805
most forms of acute osteomyelitis can be successfully treated with antibiotics , leading to complete healing without complications .    2.7103883076495756
only a few reported cases develop into a secondary , chronic form .    2.361311383609921
precision of UNK measurements using dual energy x - ray absorptiometry ( dexa ) depends on various known factors , such as positioning , aortic calcification or vertebral fractures .    2.193237314284831
the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of various diseases or bone density on the reproducibility of measurements in the lumbar spine and the proximal femur .    2.5731944488959324
the subjects were repositioned between measurements .    2.5282284041182352
in order to be able to determine the influence of various diseases , four groups of 25 patients each were formed : three with the diagnosis osteoarthrosis , osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis and one control group .    2.4075066267324634
the mean percentual difference and coefficient of variation were calculated as the measure for reproducibility .    2.2255109016377514
mean percentual differences of 0 . 18 to 2 . 6 % were found in the four groups at the three measurements sites .    3.2402925843915114
after calculation of coefficient of variation , a value between 1 . 2 and 2 . 7 % was found for lws p . a . , between 7 . 1 and 15 . 7 % for lws lat .    3.0733715925965566
and between 4 . 1 and 9 . 9 % at ward ' s triangle .    3.052536120038161
it was also conspicuous that the difference in coefficient of variation in osteoporosis patients was nearly double that in the control group in all measured areas .    2.3082082233602925
conclusion : lateral lumbar spinal measurements using dexa cannot presently be recommended .    2.0150467722350895
measurements and , with limitations , measurements at ward ' s triangle have good precision and could be used for course documentation of bone density .    2.2508942062673416
background : we compared the endothelial protective function of two hyaluronic acid UNK ( UNK UNK , UNK ) of different molecular weight and viscosity during UNK in high - risk eyes .    2.842448032949832
diseases of the peripheral nervous system occur in up to 50 % of persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) .    2.617592387958888
in early stages of the infection , guillain - barré syndrome or a spontaneously remitting UNK can occur .    2.2344178295458006
the most frequent occurrence is distal symmetrical polyneuropathy associated with hiv , which can only be treated UNK .    2.4487981920583026
the most important differential diagnosis is a drug - induced polyneuropathy under antiretroviral therapy with the nucleoside UNK UNK , UNK , or UNK .    3.0310971273773664
chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy is less common and can be treated with immunoglobulins or corticosteroids .    2.6388260259886356
very rare are steroid - responsive UNK with necrotizing vasculitis or in diffuse infiltrative UNK syndrome ( UNK ) .    2.2425223714209848
in the aids stage , UNK can occur due to opportunistic infections - most often with cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) or m . tuberculosis - or UNK due to lymphomatous UNK .    2.2283407463734464
UNK multiplex is rarely seen in disseminated cmv infection .    2.482823520023141
myopathies can occur in all stages of hiv infection ; their frequency is about 1 % .    2.50936779130248
primary polymyositis associated with hiv , which can be treated with corticosteroids or immunoglobulin , must be distinguished from myopathy induced by UNK .    2.471559980457406
other forms of myopathy are very rare .    2.9858964615421337
54 patients , who had been explored at the end of their treatment including a psychosomatic approach in a medical department of a general hospital , were interviewed again in their homes three months later .    2.585933313830134
contentment with treatment was high in the inpatient and outpatient setting , the ill felt only moderately stressed by their illnesses , showed an adaptive constellation of coping styles and were surprisingly well adapted .    1.839767529800602
the comparison between the two measures showed a less favourable view of the patients three months after discharge from hospital at a quarter of the tested parameters , the variability was high in the scales , that were used .    2.6406797000726
explanations for these results are discussed .    3.0400999555325603
at a long term perspective coping with illness may be improved especially by interventions of the family doctors .    2.33612469228173
health care costs have risen considerably since 1970 in all industrialized countries .    2.264432452061574
this has several causes : changes in demographic structure , the large number of physicians , increased personnel needs resulting from generous vacation and special leave UNK , UNK increases and - last but not least - medical progress .    2.122251538345616
advances in medical technology are often regarded as one of the main reasons for UNK costs in health care .    2.654581944671695
careful analyses reveal , however , that the high costs of imaging services are due to conventional radiography rather than to high - technology ( ct , mr ) imaging .    2.649270769162317
the legitimate demands for cost reduction have to be met with improved cost efficiency while optimal quality standards must also be maintained .    2.169291574839523
relevant suggestions , such as generally accepted examination strategies , should be realized with the help of the scientific societies .    2.620425838607427
background : main features of the UNK - UNK syndrome are mental retardation and absent or hypoplastic nails of the fifth fingers and toes .    2.543357516071204
further symptoms are wide mouth with prominent lips , sparse scalp hair , and hypertrichosis .    1.971625017335535
we report on two premature infants who had completed 25 and 29 weeks of gestation and who developed unilateral interstitial pulmonary emphysema .    1.9993679889949485
in both cases massive mediastinal displacement developed with compression and total atelectasis of the contralateral lung .    2.1413496913166927
by selective intubation of the respective main bronchus , complete ventilation of the collapsed lungs and sufficient gas exchange was achieved .    2.186635294094037
after 3 days ( case 1 ) and after 6 days ) case 2 ) , the unilateral emphysema UNK and , subsequently , bilateral respiration was possible without relapse .    2.718827739217014
6 and respectively 11 days after selective intubation , extubation was performed .    2.2760061565651077
the two children were discharged at the age of 41 / 2 and 21 / 2 months showing complete respiratory compensation and equal ventilation on both sides .    2.1901183747147144
patient with extensive keratosis palmoplantaris UNK UNK UNK ( UNK - UNK ) presented with multiple cutaneous horns .    3.3463638339208055
the clinical picture , the histology , the electro microscopic examination , the negative tumor screening and the viral classification in the tissue allowed the differentiation from other palmoplantar keratoses .    2.1922547206468637
the patient was treated successfully using a combination of acitretin with physical and chemical measures .    2.486001301267729
epidemiologic studies have shown that trace concentrations of inhalation anaesthetics UNK the air of operating UNK could have deleterious effects on the personnel ' s health .    2.2397651067274884
nitrous oxide ( n2o ) UNK vitamin b12 and thus decreases dna production by inactivation of UNK synthase .    1.9752124183878188
therefore , the united states and most european health authorities recommend threshold values to protect against potential health risks .    1.9814746898237983
these values range from 25 to 100 ppm , expressed as time - weighted averages ( UNK ) .    2.167822071227459
there is a lack of data concerning measurements of trace concentrations under defined conditions .    2.32169103242102
the aim of this study was to quantify levels of n2o in a recovery room ( rr ) with an air conditioning system .    2.0512489390319177
the blood loss during the acute period after complex pelvic trauma is finally responsible for the high mortality associated with this specific type of injury .    2.770274637741385
several protocols have been published for optimized management , but up to now comparable data are not available as no exact definitions exist judging the UNK of trauma and blood loss .    2.654964313390628
as part of a prospective study 19 patients after unstable pelvic injuries with unstable circulation underwent emergency stabilization by the pelvic c - clamp .    2.3710288574102294
beside standard clinical parameter the initial hemoglobin value was converted into a " UNK equivalent " .    2.2837915257686956
18 of the 19 patients had an injury UNK according to group iii and iv of the hannover polytrauma score ( pts ) .    2.576864484962783
concommitant abdominal injuries were seen in 12 cases ( 23 injuries ) , concommitant urological injuries in 12 cases ( 14 injuries ) .    2.411298030594686
in 13 cases the pelvis was the major source of bleeding in 9 cases an additional intraabdominal hemorrhage was observed .    2.283063980505728
11 patients died due to sequelae of their injury , 8 patients survived .    2.3513850374687935
although the initial blood loss was comparable both in the group of the deceased patients and the survivors , a 44 % higher subsequent blood substitution ( = 10 UNK ml ) was observed in the UNK group .    2.8504610209420087
in conclusion the data UNK that early control of hemorrhage is fundamental for the UNK after complex pelvic trauma .    2.3537337536770915
the estimation of the blood loss may help in indicating UNK emergency procedures like emergency stabilisation , pelvic clamps , surgical exploration and tamponade .    2.2908025193801107
this calculation may be a basis for a more detailed analyses of this devastating injury and judging the benefit of different management protocols .    2.531352964029128
in contrast to childhood intussusception , the clinical signs of intussusception in adults are nonspecific .    2.5841715628432205
generally organic alterations of the small bowel cause intussusception in adults .    2.705891809977423
sonography is not only the diagnostic tool of choice in childs , but also led to the correct diagnosis in this case .    3.4133388228775994
in contrast to childhood intussusception , operative treatment is preferred in adults .    2.20467192454689
the term " frontal lobe syndrome " comprises a variety of different clinical syndromes produced by focal lesions involving the prefrontal cortex .    2.168961709797525
however , similar syndromes can be observed after lesions involving subcortical structures connected with the prefrontal cortex in neuronal networks .    2.172813551233336
with respect to the different clinical pictures and underlying brain lesions , prefrontal lobe dysfunction may be divided into a UNK type , caused by lesion of the dorsolateral prefrontal lobe and its connections , a disinhibited type that can be observed following lesions of the orbitofrontal cortex , and an UNK type following lesions affecting the functional balance between the UNK and the supplementary motor area .    2.4632520929359187
as intracerebral lesions are rarely limited to the brain regions described , in the majority of patients various degrees of behavioural dysfunction can be observed .    2.5793362946345986
the case reports of four patients illustrating the three major prefrontal syndroms following severe head injury ( n = 2 ) or cerebrovascular disease ( n = 2 ) are presented and diagnostic implications as well as possible treatment strategies are discussed .    2.765135904072866
the measures taken in intensive care medicine are rated differently by the patients , their family , and personnel .    2.5756496664368553
a lack of understanding for intensive care therapy can lead to a negative attitude towards intensive care medicine , which in turn makes an impression on public opinion , and UNK the UNK of the co - workers in intensive care medicine .    3.127960545511671
to form an objective view , we carried out a survey of 40 co - workers ( 11 physicians , 23 from the nursing staff , and 6 ancillary personnel ) regarding the medical technology , the environment in the unit , general medical questions , and the extent of intensive care therapy .    2.304386587442271
the length of employment in the intensive care unit ranged from 1 - 240 months ( median 18 months ) , the ages ranged from 21 to 53 years ( median 30 years ) .    2.476111537740368
of those questioned 73 % found intensive care medicine in its current form to be purposeful : 100 % of the physicians and only 57 % of the nursing staff were of this opinion .    2.5618315342922595
only 9 % of the physicians believed the equipment to be fear - inducing for the patients ; in contrast , 61 % of the nursing staff believed this to be true .    2.86259121875161
the noise level was rated as very disturbing by 65 % of the nursing staff and 45 % of the physicians .    2.920457214231744
only 22 % of the nursing staff believed that the patients felt comfortable and protected on the intensive care unit ; 48 % felt that they were UNK or even UNK .    2.444045516080373
of the physicians 46 % believed that the patients were comfortable .    3.103913108561679
of the nursing staff 100 % were of the opinion that for the deceased patients , organ substitution therapy had continued too long .    2.282516566347587
on the other hand , only 45 % of the residents shared this opinion .    2.484406528438246
the medical staff rated the intensive care measures as purposeful , less disturbing for the patients and more effective than did the nursing staff .    2.628069372033315
in many cases , the nursing staff as a group exhibited a contrary and negative opinion .    2.4755246536359814
this could possibly be caused by insecurity , lack of information and lack of successful experiences .    2.5731958758475857
next to patient outcome , the competent explanation and information regarding the disease and prognosis and the recurrent communication within the intensive care team , with respect to diagnostic and therapeutic measures are the deciding factors in the opinion formation regarding intensive care medicine .    2.5040402073346373
in this pilot study 12 patients with moderate to severe atopic eczema were treated with 2 million iu interferon alpha 2a ( UNK a ) three times weekly for 8 weeks and followed up for a further 10 weeks : 2 patients showed clear and 9 a slight to moderate reduction of their skin lesions ; 1 patient got worse .    2.1444089519543703
pruritus did not decrease and even increased in a few patients , and ige levels showed no change during and after treatment .    2.683498769093902
all patients noted mild , transient , UNK - like symptoms .    2.8859818234075085
the efficacy of interferon alpha in the present therapeutic design for the treatment of atopic eczema must thus be classified as only moderate .    2.697609328409287
shock secondary to sepsis is a serious common disease with a substantial mortality .    2.4410763597969507
coagulation abnormalities , ranging from a rapid fulminant state of disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) to a slight elevation in the level of fibrin ( UNK ) degradation products , are well recognized in patients with bacterial UNK .    2.485736177620939
therefore , the inhibition of the activated coagulation is one of the first therapeutic steps .    2.8898631540736
we investigated 30 intensive care patients with septic disease and comparable signs of UNK in coagulation at the beginning .    2.679950320859635
fifteen patients were treated with 1 . 5 - 5 e / kg body weight ( low dose group ) , the others received 8 - 15 e / kg ( high dose group ) .    3.0808125419865044
our study demonstrated a significant stronger and faster decline of coagulation parameters - such as d - dimer , tat and ptf 1 + 2 - in the high dose group without any bleeding disorder .    2.1166412026016213
thus , we support in cases of coagulation disease except fulminant ones the high dose therapy with lmwh as shown above .    2.2823163961762853
background : laparoscopic techniques are currently used for curative resection of colorectal cancer although long - term results from controlled clinical trials are not available yet that prove laparoscopic procedures are adequate .    2.4144669051113246
methods : all patients who underwent a curative resection of a colorectal tumor from 1995 to 1997 were included in a prospective cohort study to evaluate the short - and long - term results .    2.742526886070021
results : laparoscopic colorectal resections were accomplished in 68 patients .    2.297325005541796
in only 3 patients was an adenoma ( stage 0 ) found , and 10 patients had multiple liver metastases at the time of palliative resection .    2.366793213411064
an oncological resection was performed in 55 patients .    3.1349183540403214
the average age was 62 . 8 + / - 14 . 6 years ( 29 female and 26 male patients ) .    2.6750046521102053
eleven right UNK , 1 left colectomy , 21 sigmoid resections , 16 UNK and 6 UNK resections were carried out .    2.1633757703153798
two patients ( 3 . 6 % ) were lost during follow - up .    3.388652565935874
the median follow - up was 27 . 1 months ( range 9 . 1 - 45 . 1 months ) .    3.1205418165755496
no port - site metastases were found .    2.507560934211369
two patients who are still alive after sigmoid resection suffered from a recurrence .    2.806552320688737
the first patient underwent only limited lymphadenectomy because of synchronous malignant lymphoma .    2.186562806829219
the second patient developed bilateral lung metastases .    2.430340239936243
only one patient died during the follow - up period because of myocardial infarction .    2.967946564747914
conclusion : although the follow - up is short , it seems that the recurrence rate is low .    2.8581874134184995
controlled multicenter clinical trials are currently performed to evaluate whether laparoscopic surgery is really adequate to treat colorectal cancer .    2.454496861074119
the authors report a tracheal rupture in a 34 - year - old patient who was primarily intubated following generalised seizures and loss of consciousness ( rüsch endotracheal tube ) .    2.1311355561197414
some hours later , she developed high ventilatory airway pressures and subcutaneous and mediastinal emphysema were noted .    2.0307752908458436
UNK with a high - volume , low - pressure endotracheal tube was planned when it was noted that the UNK of the rüsch tube was grossly UNK .    2.8716070724529565
endotracheal tube cuff pressure was measured and found to be greater than 120 cm h2o ( the maximum measurement possible with the UNK ) .    2.64191620421731
the diagnosis of tracheal rupture was confirmed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy .    2.770983550302698
the patient immediately underwent a UNK and a 3 - cm tear of the pars UNK of the trachea was sutured with a dural patch .    3.0195904709512984
to maintain low airway pressures post - operatively , she remained sedated for 2 days and received a muscle relaxant to permit pressure - controlled ventilation .    2.098442963749449
in this case , it can be concluded that excessive inflation of the endotracheal tube cuff resulted in the tracheal rupture .    2.5732564609614346
other possible causes and results of tracheal rupture are discussed .    2.636419850306348
urinary tract infections are the most frequent nosocomial infections , accounting for about 40 % of all nosocomial infections .    3.270337222300501
in most cases these infections are associated with indwelling urinary catheters .    2.4922270363495556
the guideline from the centers for disease control and prevention ( UNK , usa ) for the prevention of catheter - associated urinary tract infections , as the most important evidence - based guideline worldwide , was published in 1981 and has not been updated so far .    2.580331496181984
evidence - based national guidelines are not available in germany .    2.857168620611542
we have , therefore , performed a literature search for randomized , controlled studies on the prevention of catheter - associated urinary tract infections ( medline , UNK UNK , reference text UNK ) published since 1981 .    2.4621432414500535
fifty studies meeting our inclusion criteria were identified .    2.3099617339663143
substantial new findings have been published on alternatives to urethral catheters and new catheter materials .    2.3864181829538924
based upon the cdc guideline , whose principles are still valid , updated guidelines for the prevention of catheter - associated urinary tract infections have been developed by the national reference center for hospital hygiene .    2.271933642472119
chronic hypoperfusion of the hypogastric arteries due to aortoiliac surgery leads to a complex of symptoms well known as UNK ' s syndome .    2.4505394911140614
in contrast , acute ischemia of the pelvic arterial tree leads to lethal complications [ 2 , 4 , 5 , 9 , 10 , 12 , 13 ] .    2.4760575551520327
acute interruption of the hypogastric perfusion mainly occurs after aortoiliac surgery or after selective transcatheter embolisation of the internal iliac artery for control of pelvic bleeding [ 1 , 8 ] .    2.2679351828483845
several complications may occur after total occlusion : urinary bladder necrosis [ 6 ] , left colon ischemia , spinal cord ischemia [ 10 ] , nerve palsy , necrosis of the rectum and gluteal UNK [ 2 , 11 - 13 ] .    2.0959366978640186
despite adequate therapy , mortality is over 70 % [ 2 ] .    2.324422814794499
we report the case of a 66 - year - old patient who survived after acute occlusion of the iliac arteries with gluteal necrosis following replacement of the infrarenal aorta with an UNK graft .    2.3921359810692513
as demonstrated in 44 allogeneic UNK ( 34 hla identical , 10 hla mismatched at 1 - 3 loci ) and 6 unrelated ( 1 hla - identical , 5 mismatched at 1 - 3 loci ) cord blood ( cb ) transplantations cb has been shown to be a rich source of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells .    1.9563674610429813
therefore , a scientific pilot project in order to evaluate hla class i and ii typed cord blood samples for unrelated transplantation was initiated .    2.3195978682350646
hitherto UNK cb samples : mean volume 79 + / - UNK , were collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after vaginal full term delivery ( n = 302 ) or UNK section ( n = 70 ) and stored frozen in liquid nitrogen .    2.529334648694345
methods for hla - typing by serology for hla - class i and ii from minimal cell amounts were adjusted that only 1 . 5 ml of the whole cb was needed for both the hla - class i and ii typing by serology ( 1 ml ) and dna - typing for hla - class ii ( 0 . 5 ml ) .    2.310897555432924
only 3 . 5 additional ml of the cb were required for the ab0 typing , control of UNK , determination of progenitor cells by colony forming assays and UNK and the analysis of UNK maternal cells by simultaneous UNK and UNK analysis of UNK cells and the pcr using sequence - specific priming ( pcr - UNK ) for the non - inherited maternal UNK .    2.8900788107435265
mother ' sera have been tested for hbsag , anti - hcv , - UNK , - hiv - 1 - 2 , - ebv , - vca , - UNK - ii , - cmv , toxoplasmosis and syphilis .    2.700966105971998
nonepithelial malignant tumors of the pancreas are extremely rare neoplasms with a frequency of ~ 0 , 6 % .    2.6482601369316185
they are always explored because of a suspected diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma .    2.783431243715355
amongst the more than 600 primary pancreatic neoplasms in our pancreatic tumor UNK only 5 neoplasms were of nonepithelial origin ( one was a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor [ UNK ] , one a leiomyosarcoma , one a malignant mesothelioma , and two were peripheral neuroectodermal tumors [ pnet ] .    1.832432103151821
the differential diagnosis includes secondary infiltration of the pancreas by mesenchymal tumors of the retroperitoneum , undifferentiated pancreatic carcinoma and , especially in the case of pnet , malignant lymphoma .    2.709602252146649
preoperative chemotherapy and down - staging can improve the operability and prognosis , especially in pnet .    2.573922199284765
in patients with renal or hepatic failure , the pharmacokinetics of opioids may be affected in several ways , leading to the necessity to correct the dose .    2.393441316773155
the liver is the major site for UNK of most opioids .    2.8108219875240694
the major metabolic pathway is oxidation .    2.4544700303020006
exceptions to this are morphine and buprenorphine , which undergo primarily UNK , and remifentanil which is cleared by UNK hydrolysis .    2.2919191670305707
the hydrophilic metabolites are predominantly UNK by the kidneys and may accumulate in patients with renal insufficiency .    2.927686381882237
some metabolites such as morphine - 6 - glucuronide ( UNK ) or UNK are active opioid agonists .    2.742437169021337
with high concentrations they may cause narcotic effects or respiratory depression .    2.3507914797876017
in addition , special risks are known for UNK that has been shown to exert neurotoxic effects with the risk of seizures .    2.6346220031588907
few cases of respiratory depression following the administration of UNK , UNK and UNK have been reported .    4.035141687316656
the elimination half - life of these drugs was prolonged .    2.6953859777537805
lastly , the disposition of methadone , buprenorphine , fentanyl , UNK and remifentanil appears to be unaffected in renal failure .    2.6366896609857857
UNK : aim of this study was to validate a modification of adults ' 13c - urea breath test for children in diagnosis of an infection with helicobacter pylori .    2.391823041626359
methods : in 30 asymptomatic children results of the breath test were compared with results of an elisa test specific for helicobacter pylori .    2.593543336728871
in 10 symptomatic children the breath test result was compared with histological results of gastric mucosa .    2.299884216537171
cold orange juice was tested by ultrasonic assessment to be suitable as a test meal .    2.321587620752698
results : with the serological or histological result as reference method , the cut - off value for children ( delta value = 5 permil ) has shown a sensitivity / specificity of 70 % / 95 % or 100 % / 100 % respectively .    1.9816131658947416
cold orange juice meets the criteria of a test meal by inhibiting the gastric emptying for the duration of the breath test significantly .    2.3505465270426606
30 minutes after 13c - urea ingestion has been the optimal point of time for the second breath sample collection .    2.2427140654345425
this review summarizes some aspects of german pediatrics as it developed after world war ii .    2.2266028192044196
having lost its touch with international pediatrics regained its high standard during the late UNK and UNK and now develops in concordance with the changing needs and the advances of pediatrics in a highly UNK nation .    2.0688707444917185
as in other countries , the practice and structure of pediatrics have been influenced by changes in social UNK and expectations , and by economic restrictions .    2.2731978633669025
national specifics are the high number of practicing pediatric population and emphasis on a highly structured and UNK preventive care program under a public health plan .    2.0130532232990053
the need for critical evaluation of this program is emphasized as is the need for better communication among UNK .    2.535118169713825
aim of this study was to isolate t lymphocytes from atheromatous plaques and to determine they respond to chlamydia antigens .    2.1540662508030914
in recent years , mumps orchitis has become a rarely reported disease .    2.518399139049982
however , since october 1994 a clear increase in the incidence of this disease has been observed .    2.949828736095016
at four hospitals in the saarland , germany , 45 cases of mumps orchitis in adolescents and adults were diagnosed in this period .    2.3247535080006805
in addition to the case history and clinical findings , the diagnosis was confirmed by an increased igm titer .    3.009968130176929
none of the patients had been previously vaccinated .    3.1936736278026556
the main reason for this was a lack of parental knowledge of the necessity for this vaccination , one which has almost no side effects .    2.5451564563519646
the goal of this study is to describe the disease , present our own results , and indicate the need for vaccination .    2.831522456030317
in addition to providing information , a further aim of the study is to increase the motivation of adolescents and adults for vaccination .    2.614032307723826
although many treatments for mumps have been published in recent years , the most successful therapy is still prophylactic vaccination .    2.9721656142457906
neurofibromas , UNK au UNK macules and UNK in the axillary or inguinal regions are common manifestations of von recklinghausen ' s neurofibromatosis ( nf - 1 ) .    2.340966555938987
less known is the simultaneous appearance of dermal melanocytic naevi .    2.3014921860642925
we describe the case of a 21 - year - old UNK woman who showed generalized , multiple neurofibromas , a solitary plexiform UNK in the left gluteal region and UNK nodules .    2.5722190440515615
in addition , there were several large grey - blue macules histologically characterized by fusiform pigment - bearing cells in the dermis , which we diagnosed as persistent aberrant mongolian spots .    2.0416616212067655
in the right zygomatic region she presented a grey - blue , hair - bearing macule , which we saw as a variant of ota ' s naevus .    2.052003396213911
a genetic background for this coincidence of a systemic with a local UNK can be supposed , as both schwann ' s cells and melanocytes are derived from the neural crest .    2.1554724123395177
such pathologic rearrangement in the UNK of the cellular elements could be important for the pathogenesis of nf - 1 and dermal melanocytic nevi .    3.3364691893798506
infectious agents may directly or indirectly ( through the response of the host ' s immune system ) modulate the growth of vascular cells .    2.2051426628104918
local and / or systemic increase of cytokines could influence the extent of ( re - ) stenosis in the vascular tree .    2.5324713101940546
further studies in this field may identify patients at a high risk for UNK and restenosis .    3.0276889021045363
their results should be helpful in treating restenosis after percutaneous coronary interventions .    2.4430504469459047
besides other reasons , cost UNK UNK the rational use of preoperative screening tests which should be adapted to the risk of the individual patient .    2.8255788287308183
since the perioperative cardiac risk increases with age , elderly patients in particular require a thorough evaluation of their perioperative risk .    2.2013562798900974
routine ecg , however , is not indicated in patients under 45 years of age who do not present with signs or history of preexisting cardiac diseases but should be performed on a routine basis in all patients over 45 years of age .    2.4935445144630117
the validity of an ergometer test as a preoperative indicator of myocardial ischemia is limited due to a high incidence of false negative results .    2.5485392227427566
by preoperative routine chest radiography previously unknown findings are only detected in a small number of patients ; thus , in patients of asa - risk groups i - ii younger than 74 years of age routine chest - x - ray cannot be justified .    2.6100164239473367
in patients whose perioperative cardiac risk as assessed clinically and by ecg is ambiguous , dipyridamole - thallium - myocardial scintigraphy ( dtms ) and dobutamine - stress - echocardiography may contribute valuable information regarding the prediction of perioperative adverse cardiac events .    1.8886434328665822
in that respect , dobutamine - stress - echocardiography appears to be superior to dtms .    2.452008087086564
the laboratory tests required in patients of different asa - risk groups and according to their age are presented in an overview .    2.5145916823266683
generalized muscle weakness in critically ill patients can result in prolonged periods of artificial ventilation and longer stays in the intensive care unit .    2.2089800660823764
both neuropathic ( critical illness polyneuropathy ) and myopathic ( critical illness myopathy ) abnormalities seem to play an important role for this prolonged weakness .    2.039545395046876
this article reviews its complex differential diagnosis with special emphasis on the current understanding of the neuromuscular syndromes .    2.640450465823579
an efficient diagnostic plan is necessary for the exclusion of other curable causes of prolonged muscle weakness even in the presence of UNK changes .    2.5865399815770624
psychological support of the patient and prophylaxis of secondary complications of prolonged immobilization are crucial when specific therapy is not possible .    2.7755879410180464
modern ultrasonic diagnostic instruments with high resolution and color doppler sonography allow the UNK to describe pathological findings very precisely and at an early stage of pregnancy .    2.2696113017416377
the use of high - resolution ultrasound makes it possible to detect heart malformations already between the 8th and 10th week of gestation .    2.229298339664194
this development has essentially changed the clinical requirements on fetal autopsy which in its traditional way no longer meets the increased demands .    1.934680938561083
unless the pathologists faces this challenge the importance of fetal autopsy will diminish .    2.4512241296254444
modern image databases and communication techniques allow the pathologist to have direct access to text and images of pre - findings by other clinics .    1.9654380667120717
great importance , however , must be attached to the interdisciplinary cooperation with obstetricians and UNK .    2.658869066800939
we report on routine fetal autopsy by using an interdisciplinary database an the charité .    1.9949655201473424
this may be worse than the natural history of the disease .    2.5679196313118675
in our study , we retrospectively evaluated all infrainguinal bypass procedures performed in the past 10 years .    2.6395437791825174
radiosurgery represents a minimally invasive radiologic method for the treatment of intracranial tumours and arteriovenous malformations .    2.8325300744068107
in 1994 the UNK device ' UNK gamma knife ' ( lgk ) was installed in a dedicated logistic environment for outpatient treatments .    1.877227466369731
high quality requirements have to be met for radiosurgery .    2.8930118492321695
the target point accuracy taking into account the whole system was shown to be reliably below 0 . 5 mm whereas the spatial therapeutic resolution was 0 . 035 cm3 .    2.497624500018626
quality parameters of the dose plan were evaluated for the first 500 consecutive treatments .    2.815253826433773
these values and examples of dose plans were used to emphasize the advantages of the treatment principle with multiple UNK .    2.769131273307824
an analysis of data in the literature revealed that there is no uniform standard of treatment available in radiosurgery .    3.234725871453452
this result could be helpful in order to proceed towards a more uniform treatment standard in radiosurgery and to improve overall treatment results .    2.394763483630011
even if UNK UNK UNK has not found the true aetiology of puerperal fever - bacteria were identified as pathogens only after his observations - he was the first to consequently use epidemiological methods in order to elucidate connections and influencing factors in the spread of nosocomial infections , to draw the right conclusions from his observations on the transmission of UNK fever and to draw the right consequences by implementing preventive measures , especially the hand disinfection .    2.2424490823998915
he has correctly realized that human beings suffering from purulent or UNK lesions or having even died from them can act as infectious sources as can hands of health - care personnel act as UNK .    1.8233183339902623
as a characteristic feature of nosocomial infection , he noticed that generally only the UNK organism of the patient is involved as an infection target .    2.419856025705769
the impact of his doctrine not only made him " UNK of the mothers " but also justifies to regard him as " father of the obstetric infection prevention " if not even as the founder of the modern science - based hospital hygiene .    2.08478456705481
in this paper we present a method for measuring the wear of the polyethylene inlay in knee joint endoprostheses from standard x - ray images .    2.4669193899777215
our approach is to estimate the spatial position of the tibial and femoral components of the prostheses from their UNK in the x - ray image .    3.3713141742228787
when we know the exact shape of these two components , we can calculate the minimal spatial distance between them which approximates the remaining thickness of the inlay .    2.1852168055642225
first results show that this approach might provide sufficient accuracy for the given task .    2.6491063077227515
most children with borreliosis show cutaneous symptoms following a tick bite infected with borrelia burgdorferi .    1.963995074250927
erythema UNK is a classical skin lesion of early borreliosis characterized by a UNK expanding erythema at the site of the prior tick bite .    2.629627254330532
after hematological spreading of the vector multiple UNK UNK occur with a very low incidence in europe as described in the case of a 2 1 / 2 years old infant who was successfully treated with oral cephalosporine .    2.5263233881739566
one year follow - up revealed no further manifestations of borreliosis .    2.830112975914239
background : we compared the standard suprathreshhold strategy to the so - called threshhold splitting strategy with 5 and 2 db steps .    2.2057764109734044
resection specimens of 14 patients with small cell bronchial carcinoma after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were processed histologically and graded according to a three - step regression grading system : grade i , no or only slight tumor regression ; grade ii , incomplete tumor regression ; grade iii , complete tumor regression without vital tumor tissue .    1.9971114389050129
in five patients with either no vital tumor tissue or only small tumor remnants in the resection samples , a typical sequence of central fresh tumor necrosis , foam cell rim , vascular granulation tissue and peripheral scar formation was seen .    2.0086684864135385
this morphological finding may be interpreted as a characteristic , but unspecific parameter of good response to preoperative chemotherapy .    2.3611793300152466
the presence of vital tumor rims surrounding the capillary bed with intermingled necrotic foci , however , argues in favor of spontaneous tumor regression , which is commonly observed in small cell lung cancer .    2.420310909139092
background : the term " UNK ' s diseas " ( UNK lymph node hyperplasia ) comprises a heterogeneous UNK entity among lymphoproliferative disorders .    2.391140494355061
in accordance with the german law on care for UNK persons , an observer rating scale has been developed to allow a staging of need of care .    2.280061551524262
construction of the scale , UNK descriptions , definitions , algorithms for sum score and inter - rater reliability data are reported .    1.9561182453309804
the scale can reliably measure the need of care , quality of care , and who is the care provider .    2.8736254365268095
5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) improves the success of UNK .    2.8764933476398635
since in vitro studies showed a prolonged effect of 36 days of growth inhibition with a single dose of 5 - fu , 5 - fu is applied intraoperatively .    2.6208389157132137
to evaluate the effect of intraoperatively applied 5 - fu , we compared 13 ( low - risk ) patients with intraoperative application of 5 - fu to a control group matched by age , diagnosis , sex and stage of glaucoma .    2.7312298400396133
postoperatively on day 4 the iop was significant lower ( 4 . 8 mmhg ) in the 5 - fu - group in comparison to the untreated group ( p = 0 . 005 ; power 0 . 80 ) .    2.651754815603213
after 1 week the difference decreased to 2 mmhg and was not significant any more ( p = 0 . 16 ) .    2.498867611294679
after 1 week a lower mean intraocular pressure of 2 mmhg was found with a p - value of 0 . 16 .    2.480662306020445
it may be that these results are not just due to an antiproliferative mechanism ; a direct toxic effect of 5 - fu should be considered .    2.6248065227204758
5 - fu side effects such as corneal complications and inflammatory reaction were not increased in the 5 - fu group .    2.6176532404918946
however , one case of persistent hypotony was seen in the 5 - fu group .    2.994188686334704
this study found intraoperative use of 5 - fu to be a safe procedure with a pronounced capacity to lower iop in the direct postoperative phase .    2.4980970642049365
however , this effect may not be based on an antiproliferative effect alone , but might be of toxic origin .    2.8043672299435993
a postoperative bile fistula is a rare but severe complication after biliary surgery .    2.6650044402788944
clinical signs , laboratory findings , ultrasound and UNK lead to diagnosis .    2.764927982963916
we report on 40 cases with postoperative bile leakage after cholecystectomy treated by a nasobiliary tube .    2.103859872860984
in all patients the fistula healed within 7 days after placement of the tube .    2.620892807414774
two patients needed operative treatment of a subhepatic abscess , and in 2 patients drainage of a UNK was performed .    3.492162768504273
in 2 cases with biliary peritonitis , a step - by - step lavage was necessary .    2.3251278198854726
the nasobiliary tube for postoperative bile fistula offers regular radiological control and reduces the necessity of operative reintervention in the biliary tract .    2.145205428449308
description of a 27 years old patient with chronic renal failure due to diabetes , which requires dialysis , and tertiary hyperparathyroidism , who developed fulminant systemic UNK after successful renal transplantation .    2.319590900062642
characteristic of this syndrome , there occured soft tissue calcification , UNK of the small and medium - sized arteries and ischemic skin necrosis .    2.6073745337092635
the pathogenesis is not completely clear , but challenging agents like corticosteroids or UNK , in a sensitized organism ( at hypercalcemia or elevated UNK ) could lead to calcium deposits .    2.3811793210994967
these are showing a particular affinity for elastic tissue .    2.282855254792533
lungs , stomach , kidneys , cutis , heart and vascular system are most frequently involved .    2.3849191195936714
treatment is primarily supportive ; an early parathyroidectomy seems to have the best prognosis .    2.4726719654503557
contact urticaria and anaphylactic reactions to latex - containing rubber products are being recognized with increasing frequency in all kinds of medical disciplines .    2.2501041129831036
recently a number of reports have been published describing anaphylactic reactions to food items in patients with latex allergy .    3.1842233865820275
the cases of three patients who developed anaphylactic reactions to both latex and food items are presented , and the importance of the association of latex and cross - reactivity with food items is stressed .    2.6760926209916738
the food items that led to anaphylactic reactions were banana and avocado ; banana , avocado and buckwheat ; and banana , avocado and tomato .    1.818353516461135
the cross - reactivity of latex to buckwheat and tomato has not been reported before .    2.274384221072911
the UNK - UNK - renal syndrome ( bor syndrome ) is characterized by UNK abnormalities , lateral cervical fistulas and UNK UNK .    2.756719418140479
the hearing impairment may be a UNK , a sensorineural or a mixed hearing loss .    3.1306527841232996
the renal disease is UNK , a bilateral , congenital renal abnormality with reduced numbers of UNK .    2.7289791615426076
the bor syndrome is an autosomal - dominant disease .    2.8535699633175295
corneal metabolism is reduced after cataract extraction .    2.482541201919438
the available literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts .    1.9322918380352208
the co2 laser myringotomy is a current low - pain procedure for middle - ear ventilation for secretory otitis media ( som ) that can be performed under topical anesthesia , even in children .    2.336691979404533
the duration of middle - ear ventilation is essentially determined by the size of the perforation created .    2.75882389558975
perforations with a diameter greater than 2 mm ventilate the tympanic cavity for approximately 3 weeks , thus avoiding tympanic ventilation tubes .    2.275493033876525
to date , the co2 laser beam can only be reliably applied to the tympanic membrane via a micromanipulator system coupled to an ear microscope .    2.2908244392745383
the co2 laser otoscope is a new application system that markedly reduces the technical complexity of surgery and improves the mobility and availability of the system .    2.410737047358821
the incorporation of a small UNK - sive co2 laser in the otoscope represents a significant development in som therapy .    2.114021245425519
abstract amifostine is an organic UNK which UNK normal cells from the effects of chemotherapy with reduced nadir and duration of UNK induced neutropenia , reduced cisplatin derived renal and neurological complications being described .    2.1213944099358297
however , no data are available for urological malignancies treated with cisplatin - based chemotherapy .    2.404836642194885
aim of the study was to assess the efficacy of pretreatment with amifostine in terms of prevention of renal , hematopoetic and neurologic toxicity .    2.612947872830954
17 patients ( mean age : 62 . 6 [ 45 - 74 ] ) with advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder received inductive or adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy ( 1 - 6 cycles ) with a cisplatin dose of 70 mg / m2 .    2.3649776929273196
amifostine ( UNK - UNK mg / m2 ) was administered intravenously 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy .    2.902228306751472
for all patients creatinine clearance , serum creatinine and electrolytes including magnesium , and blood cell count were determined prior to and after each cycle .    2.1892733841936147
a group of 12 patients ( mean age : 61 . 9 [ 51 - 67 ] ) did undergo mvec chemotherapy ( 1 - 4 cycles ) without receiving amifostine and served as control group .    2.364459959316604
amifostine prevented a significant reduction of creatinine clearance even in the 2 patients with known renal insufficiency : mean creatinine clearance was 125 + / - 20 ml / min prior to and 115 + / - 25 ml / min after chemotherapy .    2.774991134692552
in the control group , however , creatinine clearance dropped from 121 + / - 30 ml / min to 85 + / - 20 ml / min after completion of mvec chemotherapy .    3.0461093370149808
serum creatinine levels did not increase significantly ( 1 . 1 mg / dl prior to and 1 . 2 mg / dl after chemotherapy ) , magnesium levels did not decrease significantly and normalized at the end of chemotherapy .    2.929956125174226
significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia developed in 29 % and 12 % of the patients in the amifostine group and in 67 % and 33 % of the patients in the control group .    3.103706122744164
amifostine was shown to have a protective effect against cisplatin induced nephrotoxicity in the elderly patient undergoing systemic chemotherapy .    2.614688548165256
the diagnosis of leptomeningeal dissemination of chronic lymphatic leukemia ( cll ) by conventional cytology is UNK because UNK criteria of malignancy are often lacking .    2.018222826029975
UNK of leukocyte differentiation antigens may also be of limited diagnostic value due to the small number of cells in cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) samples .    2.6226180689834084
molecular methods may support the specific diagnosis of leptomeningeal infiltration of cll .    2.3515180709529977
we present an 54 old patient who was diagnosed with cll five years ago .    2.4543139129058686
despite clinical signs of leptomeningeal involvement neither magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) nor conventional csf analysis were suggestive of lymphomatous meningitis .    2.167221172959756
using pcr we selectively amplified the highly variable and UNK - specific cdr3 region of the locus encoding the immunoglobulin heavy chain ( UNK ) in dna obtained from both csf and peripheral blood cells .    2.3694810887080657
analysis of pcr products by high resolution gel electrophoresis revealed a single dna fragment respectively indicating the presence of a monoclonal cell population in both compartments .    2.1204427855096304
dna sequence analysis of the amplified cdr3 segments confirmed the clonal identity of cells and the leptomeningeal dissemination of cll .    2.3749905642543907
in the orthopedic department of the university hospital homburg / saar , we use since 1993 a computer - based system for clinics organisation and documentation of operations .    2.407136628043316
hardware consists of UNK / windows pc ' s in a UNK - network .    3.2110701868476834
our software is a combination of UNK - system for managing patient - data and a special coding program for icd and UNK - digits .    2.759801563483612
our experience shows that computer assisted clinic - management is an effective tool to help the surgeon in planning and documentation .    2.295244229916833
until now , we used the system for 31 500 patients and UNK operations .    2.7694933514922244
a flexible software can meet the requirements both of the surgeons and administration .    2.3485277272473115
in one third of the little girls coming to the outpatient clinic for pediatric gynecology , a UNK can be diagnosed .    2.8288860394522866
etiologic factors are poor perineal hygiene , foreign bodies in the vagina and respiratory or skin infections .    2.088466894909512
the microbiologic investigation often reveals staphylococci , streptococci , e . coli , and in case of chronical - recurrent discharge also b . UNK and UNK .    2.6419377763229845
the symptoms are itching , burning , UNK , discharge and rubor of the vulva .    2.6922030618784065
a UNK often UNK the UNK region of little girls so that for years we use UNK UNK only which is tolerated .    2.383289061056953
excellently , a single - dose application being sufficient ; burning , itching and discharge disappear and the vaginal epithelium gets more resistant because of the estrogen influence , so that the healing process is accelerated .    2.2567976919972534
the author gives a short overview of the psychodynamic and psychoanalytic basics of psychotherapy with guided affective imagery .    2.2269087449843665
the differences of the UNK of neurotic patients and patients with severe personality disorders are demonstrated and discussed .    3.5406600445916174
two clinical cases are described in detail which show the special elements of symbol formation on different levels of ego - structure .    2.2808499397301794
then the most important results of the recent infant research and the research of attachment behaviour , especially those of the group of UNK , and their importance for the theory of symbol formation are discussed .    3.2797475762473343
the theory of potential space is used as a base for understanding UNK processes .    2.427785102832874
general and special technical UNK for the treatment of borderline cases with guided affective imagery are derived .    2.8806206061016506
especially the relationship to the theories of bion , UNK and winnicott is estimated .    2.762982690955627
in the larger cities , so - called UNK take care of ambulant psychiatric patients .    2.2925339318910174
however , no other social psychiatric institutions exist .    2.368541183887702
here , the modalities of hospital psychiatric treatment are discussed using the psychiatric hospitals in UNK and UNK as examples .    2.8515200628603283
undertreatment is also a problem , because only a few psychopharmacological drugs are produced in the ukraine .    2.6384872879409857
UNK of new psychopharmacological agents is hampered by economical problems .    2.3044748855813606
improving the availability of psychopharmacological drugs and the establishment of a social psychiatric network are major aims for psychiatrists working in ukraine .    2.1334975216483074
in this retrospective study , we analyzed the incidence of renal trauma in these trauma patients to determine which diagnostic and therapeutic approaches were most predictive .    2.74856222253518
from 1976 to 1996 , 308 children sustaining blunt abdominal trauma were admitted to our department .    2.404951488512767
patients were evaluated using abdominal UNK , ultrasonography , and urinary analysis .    2.676521125393986
in specific cases , iv urography , ct scan , and / or angiography were applied .    2.4916546098853765
we used the organ injury scale ( UNK ) for classification of renal trauma into five grades .    2.717184204602655
the result of a b - scan ultrasound examination is strongly dependent on the type of the used b - system , the chosen system parameters and the experience and critical analysis of the clinical investigator .    2.775044029939191
the estimation of quantitative acoustic parameters , independent of the type of the used b - system , is one way to overcome the subjective nature and the problems of the interpretation of b - scan images .    2.604643706469375
results of a longitudinal study about the transition to retirement are presented .    2.5777770667129434
UNK persons were interviewed three times ( quantitative study ) and 20 persons conducted a semi - structured diary ( qualitative study ) , covering in both groups a two - year period ( from half a year before retirement to one and a half years after retirement ) .    2.0126024988686035
they were asked about their subjective well - being ( UNK , UNK , satisfaction , stresses ) , their life situation and their personal , social and material resources .    2.429350269797351
the results show that the transition to retirement brings with it gains ( leisure time ) and losses ( financial , social status ) , but overall maintains a high level of well - being .    2.1510730764020174
specific analyses point out inter - individual differences , risk factors and resources , like a high level of trait well - being , health , social networks and an UNK outlook .    2.2993341073198645
the diary analyses lead to UNK , more detailed process analyses and hypotheses about cohort effects .    2.485140029815703
consequences for an adequate preparation for retirement are discussed .    2.3730700922140002
intraoperative complications can be divided into three categories on the basis of the time of their occurrence : group i - problems associated with access ; group ii : introduction of the endovascular stent ( a : release of the main segment , b : anchoring the second limb ) ; and group iii : incidence of primary UNK .    2.521842390106744
interferon alpha and gamma have been used to treat several hepatic , hematological and oncological diseases for years .    2.3019220209699602
recently , interferon beta has been introduced as a therapeutic agent in relapsing - remitting multiple sclerosis .    2.2638945750320203
a 41 - year - old female patient with multiple sclerosis developed non - tender , UNK - sized , cutaneous - subcutaneous , reddish infiltrates at the injection sites on her thighs after 8 weeks of treatment with subcutaneous interferon beta injections .    2.2854868091335088
histopathology revealed a perivascular lymphoid infiltrate of the dermis and a subtle lobular lymphoid infiltrate of the subcutis .    2.177136839669048
interferon beta therapy was discontinued for 4 weeks .    2.6404049010775372
with topical corticosteroids , the skin lesions resolved .    2.977816616316917
slight erythema and swelling at interferon beta injection site are frequent and rare cases of cutaneous necrosis have been described .    2.2290150628015537
however , no reports of large , painful , cutaneous - subcutaneous infiltrates after interferon beta therapy have been published .    2.119389928508934
in adults , infectious spondylitis is a rare but severe disease , caused by a bacterial thrombus in tissue of reduced resistance .    2.543476199286905
in conventional radiographs initial findings are a narrowing of the intervertebral space , local osteoporosis and poorly defined erosive borders of the vertebral endplates .    2.231891142793683
these changings can be found at least three to six weeks after the onset of disease .    3.0749117989735297
however , in UNK and mrt pathologic alterations are evident after ten to twelve days .    2.323264794239624
thus , early diagnosis and treatment becomes possible .    3.017995369822191
in early stages of the disease a localized lysis surrounded by a reactive sclerosis appears in predisposed areas of the vertebral body ( subchondral , UNK , ventral , central ) .    2.467590618529079
apparently , a soft tissue tumor is associated .    2.7341990239100955
sclerosis and reduction of the soft tissue tumor are the first signs of repair processes .    2.9379167879579677
after at least 12 weeks , computed tomography can reveal typical UNK of the vertebral body and occasionally the development of a bony UNK .    3.1734241757827366
the tuberculous spondylitis can sometimes cause difficulties in differential diagnosis .    2.173966949611617
clinical findings , affection of several vertebral bodies , large soft tissue tumors with appearance of calcification as well as not typical locations are strongly suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis , but these findings are not specific of the disease .    2.3012101941114285
typical for a UNK process is the integrity of the UNK disc space , which is a rare finding in spondylitis .    3.74086067128144
to show the possibilities of imaging diagnostic procedures using high and extremely high resolution ultrasonic probes we investigated the anatomic structures of the foot .    2.5339947957314957
we examinated 10 cadaver UNK of the anatomic institute and in a clinical trial 20 healthy patients with 10 to 20 - mhz - probes and could identify correctly single tendons and ligaments even in the toe region .    2.3273955682662515
especially the possibility of dynamic examination had to be mentioned beside the other advantages of ultrasound diagnostic ( saving of expenses , lack of radiation , side - to - side comparison ) .    2.4250787444155386
an essential parameter for the incorporation of drugs and narcotics into head hair is the content of hair pigment ( UNK ) .    2.214310453625734
UNK studies of hair should therefore take the colour of the hair into consideration .    2.5257869074608448
as the available UNK for verbal characterisation is small and the description depends on the subjective opinion of the UNK , it was the purpose of this study to investigate if colorimetric measurements allow UNK of hair colour .    2.7393335187089947
the natural hair colour of 17 subjects was described subjectively in words and by comparing it with a hair colour chart ( UNK , darmstadt , germany ) .    2.1747896057571356
the descriptive UNK of the hair colours ( e . g .    3.1332188279297277
UNK , brown , black ) could often not be recognised in the colorimetric results .    2.104409701429089
sometimes considerable differences were also found between the colour values of the natural hair samples and the specimens used for comparison .    2.5465499008997523
when the colour measurements were repeated at intervals of several days the results were found to be reproducible .    3.0213172724750263
we measured the ventilatory pattern and additional work of breathing ( wobadd ) at three different levels of inspiratory pressure support [ ips 5 , 10 , 15 mbar above positive end - expiratory pressure ( peep ) ] and in a new ventilatory mode , automatic tube compensation ( atc ) , in nine operative patients without lung injury nine patients ventilated for several following acute respiratory insufficiency ( ari ) .    1.9493166319455186
in atc , endotracheal tube resistance is compensated automatically by means of closed - loop control of the calculated tracheal pressure .    2.504155700194746
pressure support in this mode , i . e . airway pressure above peep , is equal to the actual flow - dependent pressure drop across the endotracheal tube ( ett ) .    2.253410235356863
airway pressure rises at the beginning of inspiration and falls towards the end .    2.4404660043710242
the result is a near - constant tracheal pressure at peep both during inspiration and during expiration .    1.9990818683547356
this mode could be best termed as " electronic extubation " .    2.137264499285499
the most striking difference between the postoperative patients and the ari patients was their minute ventilation ( 17 . 8 + / - 1 . 85 l / min in ari patients vs 7 . 3 + / - 3 . 1 l / min in the postoperative patients ) .    2.863675441754054
in the postoperative patients augmentation of ips from 5 to 15 mbar induced a steady increase in tidal volume ( vt ) and a consecutive decrease in respiratory rate ( rr ) compared with atc ( vtatc , postop = UNK + / - 78 ml ; rratc , postop = 16 + / - 4 min - 1 ; vtips5 , postop = UNK + / - 79 ml ; UNK , postop = 15 + / - 4 min - 1 ; vtips10 , postop = UNK + / - 86 ml ; UNK , postop = 14 + / - 4 min - 1 ; vtips15 , postop = 660 + / - 151 ml ; UNK , postop = 12 + / - 4 min - 1 ) , whereas the augmentation of ips of 5 and 10 mbar in the ari patients could not compensate for the increase in rr and the decrease in vt , after switching from atc to ips ( vtatc , ari UNK + / - 308 ml , rratc , ari = 24 + / - 6 min - 1 ; vtips5 , ari = UNK + / - 315 ml ; UNK 5 , ari = 27 + / - 8 min - 1 ; vtips10 , ari = 653 + / - UNK ml ; UNK , ari = 25 + / - 8 min - 1 : even ips 15 was not able to reestablish vt at the values observed during atc ( vtips15 , ari = 680 + / - UNK ml ) .    2.443569054848831
during atc wobadd was small in both postoperative and ari patients ( wobadd , atc , postop = 93 + / - 36 mj / l , wobadd , atc , ari = 116 + / - 72 mj / l ) .    2.495633763098482
however , ips 10 and 15 mbar were able to compensate for wobadd ( wobadd . UNK , postop wobadd , UNK , postop = 189 + / - 77 mj / l ; wobadd , UNK , postop = 55 + / - 30 mj / l ; wobadd , UNK , postop = 21 + / - 11 mj / l ) .    2.871378403992994
in the ari patients an ips 5 , 10 or 15 mbar was not sufficient to compensate for wobadd ( wobadd , ips 5 , ari = UNK + / - 262 mj / l ; wobadd , ips 10 , ari 863 + / - UNK mj / l ; wobadd , ips 15 , ari UNK + / - 298 mj / l ) .    2.294577709224298
under atc , wobadd was only 15 % of wobadd under ips of 15 mbar .    2.2704918994984142
all but two patients were successfully extubated after the investigation .    2.762151738824504
these two patients were not extubated because they were dependent on an fio2 > 0 . 5 .    2.879364353391279
our results strongly indicate that ventilatory dependence in ari patients may be caused by the ett rather than by mechanical dysfunction of the lung .    2.694358205101327
atc is a very helpful mode to use in distinguishing between ventilatory failure caused by ett and real ventilatory dependence .    2.19802752859033
the preoperative localization of UNK - resistent focal epilepsies before surgery and the prognosis concerning seizure outcome are both of importance .    2.4951885678795054
in addition to conventional mri diagnostics for the detection of small epileptogenic lesions , proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging ( hmr spectroscopy ) can be useful for assessing the UNK of pathological changes in cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies .    2.363165442894931
the technique and findings of hmr spectroscopy are reported in patients with cryptogenic temporal lobe epilepsies .    2.653915959536512
the findings indicate that chemical shift imaging ( UNK ) investigations of the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres provide important information for the prediction of seizure outcome after epilepsy surgery .    2.408617693195524
this paper describes the conceptual considerations in planning and realizing an inpatient unit for traumatized patients .    2.0443115937400296
the different concepts of the dynamic of the traumatic disease and the UNK of posttraumatic UNK ( UNK ) are highly significant in regard to the realisation of differing concepts of inpatient therapy of trauma .    3.0401500994546624
the utilisation of UNK UNK ( kbt ) and creative therapy in our conflict - and solution - oriented analytic concept permits us to neglect a fictitious UNK between UNK and UNK and a " potential space " ( winnicott ) can be opened to the creative work with the patients .    2.441807033129312
this paper illustrates with some UNK examples the utilisation of kbt in transforming the traumatic body - UNK into UNK memory - scripts , by the use of UNK processes .    2.1819741590365833
in 55 consecutive patients with the same dual chamber pacemaker ( UNK , intermedics ) and different pacing leads , the influence of different safety margins for pacing on battery current was investigated .    2.62665394430785
2 . 8 + / - 0 . 9 years after implantation , atrial and ventricular pulse - width thresholds ( trs ) ( ms ) were determined at 0 . 5 , 1 . 0 , and 2 . 0 v , and the charge delivered at threshold was UNK .    3.1080772781128627
if trs was < 1 . 50 ms at 0 . 5 v , an amplitude of 1 . 0 v was programmed in the atrium and the UNK ; if trs was < 1 . 50 ms at 1 . 0 v , then an amplitude of 2 . 0 v was chosen .    2.4701446318070484
with every safety margin , battery current ( irs ) ( µa ) was averaged from 5 telemetric readings in UNK mode with 70 bpm .    1.897202435272707
UNK was significantly lower with 2x qrs as compared with 2x urs ( 13 . 43 + / - 1 . 0 vs . 14 . 20 + / - 1 . 2 µa , p < 0 . 01 ) and as compared with 3x trs ( 13 . 99 + / - 1 . 2 µa , p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.5244621725257166
this applies to every safety margin tested .    2.4316956980621205
differences in battery current caused by the safety margins will translate into a greater gain in longevity in future pacemaker models with reduced internal current consumption .    2.037652208357442
any medical procedure must be legally authorized by the patient , giving informed consent .    2.760810852804638
this prerequisite is based on the right to self determination .    3.5126435949109625
otherwise a medical procedure is considered as physical injury .    2.658818545389918
thus , the way , how a specific procedure is performed , predominantly depends on the patient ' s will .    2.8287468345566555
the attending physician ' s duty is to find out this will , which is especially important when old patients and patients incapable of giving valid consent are involved .    2.385174183144509
before the procedure the physician has to have a UNK talk with the patient .    3.0033641067635735
he has to point out the best treatment possible considering the individual circumstances of the patient ' s life .    2.6126315263642748
the physician has to find out , weather the patient is competent to refuse or consent to treatement .    2.494922723760479
furthermore the consultation is an opportunity to diminish the patient ' s fear and to increase his confidence .    2.4170961880235566
the main problem treating old patients is that they often lack the mental ability for appreciation of the nature of the situation .    2.2469563362262974
one has to differentiate between the physiological mental UNK and dementia or psychiatric diseases .    2.5666078011358935
in these cases a third party consent is necessary .    2.3638678918880958
this review of german neurology during the nazi era UNK first the significance of jewish neurologists for the history of the specialty , and the UNK loss that their UNK from germany represented .    2.437351870431016
a brief discussion of the scientific UNK of german neurologists during this time is followed by a description of violations of ethical principles , exemplified by the human experiments of g . UNK .    2.3402455455058764
the spirit of the age UNK a UNK influence .    2.717199165209488
a UNK survey targeted at 1000 firms in the metal - and electronic working industry of northrhine westfalia was carried out by UNK UNK und institute of UNK to analyze the implementation of the collective agreement concerning partial retirement .    2.2582199416224844
as the results show , firms in northrhine westfalia are UNK to accept the collective agreement and use partial retirement though there are still problems left to solve .    2.2438311638308877
firms are further using partial retirement as an instrument of early retirement .    2.317471067159072
therefore partial retirement is created as a so - called " blocked model " .    2.3490817232921466
from february 1991 to may 1998 , UNK patients had a cardioverter / defibrillator ( icd ) implanted .    2.670955888743508
mean age was 64 + / - 9 years , 278 male and 62 female .    2.7214584430150612
60 % of patients had coronary artery disease and 31 % dilative cardiomyopathy .    3.4867645794958353
ejection fraction was 38 + / - 14 % .    3.0040085452352585
the indication for an implantable cardioverter / defibrillator was in 57 % of patients ventricular tachycardia , in 43 % ventricular fibrillation .    2.6385471230634376
in 25 patients additional subcutaneous patch or array electrodes and in 2 patients additional epicardial patch electrodes were implanted .    2.214027696836637
implantation site was in 92 patients abdominal and in UNK pectoral .    2.547907636763984
over a period of 7 years 34 lead - related complications occured in 33 patients ( 9 . 7 % ) , after a median of 2 months after implantation .    3.0410039355199467
diagnosis was made by routine chest x - ray in about 55 % of lead - related complications , by clinical presentation ( inadequate therapy , pain ) in 24 % , and by electrical parameters in 21 % .    2.403007925082307
in patients with an abdominal implantation site , lead - related complications occurred in 20 % , in contrast to 6 % in patients with a pectoral implantation site .    3.225072668466221
regarding patients with pectoral implantation site , lead - related complications were observed in 12 % of patients with a dual - chamber icd vs 4 % with a single - chamber icd ( p = 0 . 05 ) , due to dislocation of atrial electrodes with dual - chamber icd .    2.9513698576436593
there were no differences in clinical parameters between patients with pectoral vs abdominal and between single vs dual - chamber icd .    2.1218181673892507
several new approaches are available for early defibrillation .    2.8860355221192844
one example is semiautomatic defibrillators used by the first arriving emergency staff .    2.374860944869983
the recommendations for introducing emergency medical UNK ( emt ) defibrillation in germany are based either on the results in cities with so called doctor - UNK - UNK or the experiences of the german multi - center - study .    2.694147089488888
this analysis intends to contribute data to an emt defibrillation program in cities with a so called rendezvous - system .    2.120300623268304
methods : in a prospective study a emt - defibrillation group ( = dg ) was compared with a standard group ( basic life support by emts and defibrillation by emergency physicians ) ( = sg ) and a control group ( emergency physicians starting resuscitation alone or together with emts ) ( = cg ) .    2.215808139366915
in the dg semiautomatic defibrillators from UNK ( UNK 3000 ) were used .    2.781011126858565
successfully resuscitated patients were followed up with the glasgow coma scale ( gcs ) , the pittsburgh brain stem score ( UNK ) , and pittsburgh cerebral ( UNK ) and overall performance UNK ( UNK ) .    2.904499494747618
results : over 13 months 43 patients were included , primarily presenting with ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) .    2.1489445345668146
depending on the first arriving emergency staff the patients were allocated to the dg ( n = 12 ) , to the sg ( n = 18 ) or to the cg ( n = 13 ) .    2.989954515363662
dg and sg did not differ significantly concerning the primary survival rate or the long - term prognosis ( primary successful 8 . 3 % vs . 38 . 9 % , definite successful 0 % vs . 27 . 8 % ) .    2.611825852690357
the primary survival rate in the dg was significantly lower than in the cg ( 8 . 3 % vs . 61 . 5 % ) .    3.217416782844039
in the long term survival rate there were no significant differences .    2.8638773006880225
in the dg significantly less patients received bystander cpr ( 8 . 3 % ) than in the other groups ( 55 . 6 % and 69 . 2 % ) .    2.821670473160842
neither the variable " witnessed UNK " nor " bystander cpr " had a significant influence for the outcome of the patients in this study .    2.519292033229053
the average response time for the first arriving rescue team was 5 . 5 + / - 2 . 4 min , without a significant difference between the groups .    2.9576848304290992
conclusions : a comparison of this study with american , european and german recommendations for emt defibrillation programms revealed some deviations .    2.2885823969866217
bystander cpr seems to be of special importance as well as the time interval between defibrillation and the arrival of the emergency physician .    3.124745714743622
a benefit of emt defibrillation could not be demonstrated in our " rendezvous - system " , possibly because the time interval was less than 4 min ( 3 . 5 min ) .    2.723621264242819
since the result is in accordance with the german multi - center - study , a critical consideration of a emt defibrillation program seems to be necessary in " rendezvous - systems " .    2.5875712032972413
ninety - two strains of UNK - resistant enterococci ( UNK ) from 80 patients of 31 hospitals in 11 federal states were analyzed .    2.631991750503498
they were primarily isolated in intensive care units ( general , surgical , UNK , pediatric , oncological ones ) , but also in UNK / dialysis or neurologic / orthopaedic wards .    2.6322172739670835
a dominance of vana type e . faecium strains was observed ( n = 81 ; 88 . 0 % ) .    2.456907530789503
in addition , strains of e . UNK ( vana ; n = 4 ; 4 . 4 % ) , e . faecium ( UNK ; n = 1 ; 1 . 1 % ) , and e . UNK ( UNK , n = 6 ; 6 . 5 % ) were found .    3.8168667930431304
the 81 vana strains of e . faecium possessed the following resistances to other antibiotics : UNK , ciprofloxacin ( both 93 . 8 % ) , ampicillin , UNK ( both 88 . 9 % ) , rifampicin ( 79 . 0 % ) , trimethoprim / UNK ( 61 . 7 % ) , UNK ( 18 . 9 % ) , UNK acid ( 12 . 3 % ) , UNK / UNK ( 7 . 4 % ) ; UNK ( 46 . 9 % ) and UNK ( 37 . 0 % ) , also together with ampicillin resistance ( 9 . 9 - 35 . 8 % ) .    3.3980211173362553
in some of these vana type strains resistance to UNK cannot be completely expressed in - vitro .    2.458423729575915
UNK analysis of e . faecium outbreak isolates ( vana type ) from hospitals in different federal states indicated an intra - and interhospital spread of a defined strain .    2.0796984588933682
however , heterogeneous plasmid and plasmid restriction patterns showed that these strains were not completely identical .    1.951734392417359
the UNK dissociation ( sd ) is a complex injury of the shoulder girdle , mostly associated with polytraumatized critically ill patients .    2.7487666286294163
this case report of 3 patients shows the variety of possible injuries combined with sd .    2.465342769205842
diagnosis and therapy in such a rare trauma , which is most likely seen in specialized trauma centres are being described .    2.583199774655526
the 3 patients are presented from trauma to management , with remarks to various possibilities in treatment .    2.235016135855978
reports of other groups include multicenter studies with small numbers of patients , making it different to look for UNK or defining standards , whereas current guidelines are being mentioned , including remarks on the management of these mostly polytraumatized and UNK endangered patients .    2.033621388612549
this is a case report on arthroscopic removal of a glass splinter from the knee joint of a 56 - year - old male .    2.522615324399775
recurrent hemarthrosis of the knee was the reason for differential diagnosis , as the patient could not remember any trauma .    3.0418090085967053
after performing mri , a 12 x 5 mm signal - free zone showed up in the area of the lateral UNK femoris , which was identified through arthroscopy as a glass splinter and removed .    2.4509537191855695
the patient was discharged soon after without any complaints .    2.3960994529405713
many patients with acquired strabismus do not suffer from diplopia and confusion after an individually and age - dependent interval .    2.106298108872154
they inhibit the image of the deviated eye by binocular UNK and particularly by the physiological ability to UNK visually disturbing stimuli .    2.3383346397123663
red cells , platelet concentrates and fresh frozen plasma of a single donation contain leucocytes , causing a lot of side effects .    2.2323999093286244
modern filtration - and apheresis - techniques lead to a reduction of residual leucocyte counts of < UNK per unit .    2.4335796945863897
the best method to achieve controlled and validated conditions is the blood bank performed standardised UNK - filtration .    2.037967356618007
this is an effective method , to prevent cytokine - mediated and leucocyte - mediated febrile UNK transfusion reactions ( UNK ) , to prevent a primary immunisation to leucocyte - and UNK - antigens , to avoid transmission of viral infections by blood transfusion , e . g .    2.451082770616436
cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) and to exclude in special cases bacterial UNK .    2.6309930420342056
in addition , there are references to reduce the postoperative infections , the rate of recurrence of a tumor and the postoperative complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery .    3.1528929273623425
the use of leucocyte - UNK blood components for special indications is meanwhile established .    2.3486467593781
some european countries have made a decision for a general filtration of all blood components containing leucocytes .    2.1532797190519455
the authors recommend the general leucocyte - depletion of blood components considering the german medical law ( UNK ) and cost / benefit ratio .    2.366530394444433
evaluation of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological treatment frequently uses rating scales without regard for patients ' defensiveness .    2.055037984455363
this study demonstrates on 309 psychotherapy patients treated with inpatient client - centered therapy and followed - up 1 year after treatment that defensiveness , measured with validity scales of personality inventories mmpi - k , fpi - r and UNK - test , influences ratings ( scales cgi , UNK , hamd , UNK ) before and after therapy .    2.299059796487563
patients who deny psychopathology on admission do so at discharge and to some extent at follow - up .    2.0277988023273235
the extent of effect is significantly diminished with an increase in UNK in these patients , indicated by the significant improvement in validity scales .    2.989124711007858
inpatient client - centered psychotherapy improved defensiveness in the case of initial self - criticism and diminished it in the case of initial UNK .    2.501945498973775
introduction : because of their frequency and consequences UNK remains a demanding clinical entity with significant social and economical impact .    2.1839879456797777
there is a high demand on therapeutic modalities , using UNK medicine methods in the treatment of orthopaedic diseases .    2.812772607109091
no data is available on the UNK of methods like natural herbs in combination with acupuncture .    3.184880817848957
aim of our study was to present data on the effect of acupuncture and UNK natural herbs in sciatic pain .    2.68073659948262
we compared these results with nerve root infiltration by local anaesthetics and corticosteroids in our orthopaedic outpatient clinic .    2.1210473553133906
materials and results : 278 patients with chronic pain for at least 3 months were observed .    2.6576990317706697
all three therapeutical modalities showed improvement of pain scores .    2.2790373937773745
best results were gained with steroid injection ( n = 26 ; 66 % pain reduction ) , acupuncture in combination with herbs improved the pain in average of 62 % ( n = 230 ) , whereas injection with local anaesthetic had a pain reduction of 48 % ( n = 22 ) .    2.467127441393012
sole UNK - hcl treatment had significant less pain reduction compared to the other treatment modalities .    2.604719657418168
conclusion : according to our results acupuncture in combination with herbs and steroid nerve blocks appear to be an effective and thus recommendable conservative therapy in cases of sciatic pain .    2.6638045722817902
taking into account that patients increasingly prefer UNK modalities of treatment our study gains importance for UNK UNK .    2.174230199129826
this paper concerns advances in the integration of psychotherapy in psychiatric education and clinical practice and whether they go along with increasing research activities .    2.274266283550999
to find answers , a survey on psychotherapy research was carried out in all german psychiatric hospitals and departments by means of a questionnaire .    2.416311367642234
the results indicate that psychotherapy research is done nearly exclusively in university hospitals .    2.222087798454092
about half of them had already published psychotherapy studies and two thirds of them are presently carrying out studies , mostly including prospective , randomized clinical trials .    2.2962171008159618
these studies cover the whole spectrum of psychiatric disorders : substance abuse , schizophrenic and affective disorders , anxiety , and obsessive compulsive and personality disorders .    2.0716866774707223
to improve psychotherapy research conditions further , efforts are necessary to increase scientific exchange , financial support , and the integration of institutions outside the universities .    2.4733332627180884
there is little to suggest that the course of UNK can be substantially affected by drug treatment .    3.076017208913473
the vast majority of randomized studies do not indicate beneficial effects of antihypertensive treatment on proteinuria , fetal heart rate abnormalities , UNK UNK and the incidence of preterm birth .    2.804332302866111
there is also no definite effect on the development of superimposed preeclampsia , hellp syndrome , renal failure or eclampsia .    2.589264533355383
moreover , blood pressure lowering agents fail to improve uteroplacental perfusion but may have adverse effects on fetal growth .    2.32892233426292
antihypertensive treatment is only indicated in severe hypertension ( > 170 / 110 mm hg ) to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage .    2.521753863881246
UNK injections may result in reduced placental blood flow and fetal distress .    2.579371752917386
oral UNK offers some advantages in view of more potent vasodilator actions on uterine and UNK vessels and a lower incidence of fetal distress .    2.2630620858759034
cerebral vessels are particularly sensitive to magnesium , which works by reversing cerebral vasoconstriction with resultant improvement in blood flow .    2.0294283929070356
controlled trials have shown magnesium to be superior to both placebo and phenytoin for the prevention of eclampsia .    2.4285058319024833
furthermore , magnesium has been found to be more effective than diazepam and phenytoin in preventing recurrence of seizures in women with eclampsia .    2.3518139303185426
also the neonatal outcome UNK magnesium , which is now generally accepted as the drug of choice for the prevention and treatment of eclampsia .    2.8276591631335926
baker ' s cysts were treated operatively in 19 patients in the department of traumatology of the university of cologne from 1988 to 1997 .    2.854204022160759
the subjective and objective results were evaluated with a questionnaire and a clinical examination and sonography ( follow - up : 95 % ) .    2.9815102141233676
we differentiated between the congenital primary cyst ( 39 % ) , and the secondary form , which was always associated with an intraarticular lesion ( 61 % ) .    2.912903825288194
arthroscopy was performed in all secondary forms of baker ' s cyst .    2.7746666094514367
postoperative complications were two UNK due to one hematoma and one effusion .    2.7176109010592575
patient ' s evaluation of operation result was " excellent " in 61 % and " good " in 39 % of cases .    2.4156924353202425
all knee joints had a full range of motion .    2.7423718679477607
there was only one case of a recurrent cyst .    3.2629842437224794
the primary form of baker ' s cyst has always to be extirpated , according to our clinical experience .    2.327049397127767
the extirpation of the secondary baker ' s cyst and the relevance of arthroscopy and treatment of the basic disease have to be discussed .    2.992143447881914
in median UNK ligament syndrome , compression of the celiac artery is caused by an abnormally low insertion of the median arcuate ligament in the presence of normally located celiac and superior mesenteric arteries .    2.413664000321473
a lot of controversy exists concerning the indication for operation and the best mode of treatment .    2.773195493554772
depending on the presence and quality of collateral pathways , the symptoms vary considerably .    2.7768919644173917
we report a rare case of arcuate ligament syndrome with two - vessel involvement .    2.197952469752269
in such cases surgical treatment seems to offer substantial benefit .    2.4131227590665976
usually transsection of the compressing arcuate ligament is sufficient .    2.3273654941812216
bypass procedures should remain limited to cases in which transsection does not enable a significant increase in splanchnic blood flow .    2.342553987488334
the microscopic examination of UNK - stained blood films for the diagnosis of malaria is a highly sensitive technique .    2.902235332616807
however , the expertise required is a major disadvantage .    2.576188673753569
recently , methods not dependent on microscopy have become commercially available .    2.2024966566691724
the use of an antigen - UNK assay for the detection of UNK - rich protein 2 , an antigen specific for UNK UNK , forms the basis of the UNK - f ( UNK UNK ) and the ict malaria pf test ( ict diagnostics ) .    3.1928398651294927
parasite lactate dehydrogenase is the basis of another UNK UNK assay developed by flow inc .    2.4997704383551103
these currently available assays have been evaluated in a number of trials giving sensitivities and UNK of 90 - 100 % .    2.817121969960617
a decreased sensitivity is found in cases with low UNK .    3.1928764637275346
however , false - negative results have also been reported in patients with high parasite densities .    3.0050420389725794
purpose : discussion in the literature of peripheral nerve lesions after surgical treatment is based mainly on orthopedic surgery or on ischemic syndromes .    2.5138574132438065
methods : between 1992 and 1996 , 436 patients underwent peripheral arterial revascularization , including 147 cases of deep revascularization , 127 supra - genicular femoro - popliteal bypasses , 116 infra - genicular femoro - popliteal bypasses and 56 femoro - crural bypasses .    1.7430396157059964
mean patient age was 70 . 5 + / - 5 . 8 years ; 182 patients were female and UNK were male .    2.687490922654968
there was a 38 % rate ( 166 / 436 ) of reoperation .    2.1285838277715565
all patients were examined based on anamnestic information and a detailed clinical neurological investigation , including the methods of weber and UNK .    2.36155417963309
results : we found eleven patients ( 4 % ) with peripheral nerve lesions after the primary operation .    2.9221504342565563
after the reoperation 55 patients ( 33 % ) had nerve lesions .    2.661043078251449
conclusions : peripheral nerve lesions with sensory disturbance were present in 15 % of our patients on discharge from hospital .    2.6172136147765355
they had mainly dysesthesia and UNK but no kind of motor dysfunction .    2.175524050626204
classic and hiv - associated kaposi ' s sarcoma ( ks ) are predominantly found in male UNK .    2.3556172925424237
it is unclear why ks is so rare in women .    2.2302012538979623
at the department of dermatology , university of frankfurt , epidemic ks was diagnosed in UNK / UNK ( 40 % ) male and 5 / 72 ( 18 % ) female hiv - infected patients .    2.6153059196824375
to detect common parameters regarding immunodeficiency , hormonal disturbances , abnormalities in clinical course , or sexual practices , data of eight women with ks ( five hiv + , three hiv - ) were compared .    2.055467965212986
in hiv + women ks is more aggressive than in hiv - women and more aggressive than in hiv + men .    2.321321845492137
early and frequent visceral involvement and no preference for the lower extremities are found .    2.398091405048975
compared to hiv - women with ks , hiv + women are generally younger ( mean age 38 vs 71 years ) and significantly UNK ( reduced absolute cd4 cell count and cd4 / cd8 ratio ) .    2.103780081130292
all women with ks investigated for sexual hormones ( 7 / 8 ) showed abnormalities : 7 / 7 had low oestrogens , 4 / 6 low UNK and 3 / 5 low progesterone .    1.9870929386680507
controls ( n = 11 , hiv + without ks ) showed a clear trend for higher serum levels of sexual hormones , but the difference was not significant .    2.580529696889634
although different reasons for low levels of oestrogens ( drug abuse , UNK , menopause ) must be considered , the lack of oestrogens seems to be a common finding in hiv + and hiv - women with ks .    2.860669099870481
there was no correlation between sexual practices ( anal or oral - UNK contacts ) and the manifestation or aggressiveness of ks .    2.143388106196916
the aim of the study was the assessment of left ventricular ( lv ) systolic function and left ventricular mass following aortic valve replacement ( avr ) due to aortic valve stenosis as well as the influence of regression of lv hypertrophy in patients with normal and impaired lv systolic function prior to surgery .    2.634839095931267
74 patients with severe aortic valve stenosis ( 29 female , 45 male , mean age 66 + / - 18 years ) were divided into 2 groups according to lv ejection fraction ( ef ) : group 1 with ef > 50 % ( n = 40 ) ; group 2 with ef < = 50 % ( n = 34 ) .    2.6181400668472463
furthermore , patients were differentiated into a group a without ( n = 53 ) and a group b with aortic regurgitation ( < = ii ° , n = 21 ) .    2.7920535634016543
all patients were examined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1 month after surgery .    2.7437080037862644
there was a significant decrease of lv UNK and UNK UNK indices following avr in group 2 and group b .    2.7730352720579496
patients with preoperatively lower ef ( group 2 ) showed an increase in lv ejection fraction from 39 + / - 10 % before avr to 47 + / - 11 % after avr ( p < 0 . 001 ) , whereas patients with preoperative normal ef ( group 1 ) showed a significant decrease in ef ( from 62 + / - 8 % to 57 + / - 10 % , p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.7813583963336805
also patients with combined aortic valve disease before avr had an increase of ef after surgery ( from 45 % UNK ; 14 % to 56 + / - 14 % , p < 0 . 03 ) .    2.5217214105769976
there were significant decreases of interventricular septum thickness and lv posterior wall thickness in group 1 and group a , whereas a significant decrease of lv UNK diameter index was noted only in group b .    2.1396358807605016
improvement of the nyha functional class could be demonstrated in group 2 from 2 . 8 + / - 0 . 7 before to 2 . 2 + / - 0 . 6 after avr , as well as in group b from 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 7 before to 1 . 9 + / - 0 . 7 after surgery .    3.247702104300778
in conclusion , patients with impaired lv function or combined aortic valve disease showed a significant improvement of left ventricular systolic function after avr , while patients with normal lv function presented a slight decrease of ef .    2.4293900437339735
there was a significant regression of left ventricular muscle mass in all groups independent of the left ventricular functional status .    2.759315301644548
cardiomyocytes lose the ability to UNK after birth .    2.897753436852797
subsequently , irreversible cellular damage , e . g . , during myocardial infarction , causes loss of functional properties and cell replacement by fibrotic tissue .    2.2878244101905607
it is , therefore , not surprising that cell replacement strategies such as cardiomyocyte transplantation in damaged myocardium or scar tissue has gained widespread interest .    2.0804671070589467
in other species such as mice , rats , and dogs , the technical feasibility of skeletal UNK - , satellite cell - , and fetal cardiomyocyte UNK into normal and diseased myocardium has been demonstrated by simple injection methods .    2.0533053703309223
repeatedly , it has been shown that transplanted cells may survive for weeks within host myocardium and build intercellular connections such as UNK junctions and desmosomes .    2.3422684201955093
in contrast , UNK connections have not , as yet , been convincingly demonstrated .    2.131986293119211
UNK , cell transplants might exhibit the following functional properties : stabilization of diseased tissue to prevent structural remodeling ; carrier for recombinant proteins , growth factors or drugs to induce molecular alterations of host myocardium ; and improvement of regional and global myocardial function due to active contractility .    1.7722237143455735
however , clear evidence of coordinated contractility of transplanted cells , and , thus , of a clinically relevant therapeutical use of cardiomyocyte transplantation as a replacement strategy for damaged host cardiac cells , remains to be demonstrated .    2.149721023798714
concomitant with advances in medicine , involving the development and use of antibiotics , immunosuppressive drugs , organ / stem cell transplantation and pre - existing illnesses such as aids , the frequency of fungal infection has increased dramatically .    2.401864841871427
these factors determine the susceptibility of the lung for an acute or chronic course of disease .    2.5836943077959567
purpose : we evaluated the speed of sound ( sos ) and broadband ultrasound UNK ( bua ) at the os calcis as an indicator of osteoporosis and observed the age - related changes in ultrasound values in normal women .    2.2415489512529296
materials and methods : bua and sos were measured in UNK women using the " achilles " UNK ( UNK , UNK , ohio ) .    2.71884863045406
from the bua and sos values the bua / sos index ( " stiffness " index ) is calculated .    2.0434729847884703
we investigated 55 female patients with osteoporosis ( aged 43 - 85 years ) and 181 healthy women ( aged 20 - 80 years ) .    2.196429328635399
results : ultrasound values for women with osteoporosis were significantly lower than those for the normal control group .    2.3293644512390217
the z - score compared with young normals was higher for the bua / sos index ( - 3 . 1 ) than for bua ( - 2 . 5 ) and sos ( - 3 . 0 ) .    2.728783866969585
at a bua / sos index of 68 the sensitivity was 85 % , and the specificity was 77 % for patients with osteoporotic fractures .    2.9174134153390554
we found a significant decline with age in sos ( r = - 0 . 55 ) , bua ( r = - 0 . 50 ) and bua / sos index ( r = - 0 . 57 ) .    2.251184219738104
conclusion : ultrasound bone densitometry at the os calcis can be used as a screening test in the diagnosis of osteoporosis .    2.745086226767463
because of demographic development and the progress of medicine , the number of patients who are not able to give their consent is increasing .    3.0724082721770904
in practice , we make do with the presumed consent of the patient or , for procedures that can wait , with the consent of legitimate family members .    2.2567325378977805
an initiative action is suggested by physicians and hospitals that should reduce this UNK zone and the forensic risks UNK .    2.0840306566632734
a number of studies has shown a significant relationship between life events / life conditions and depression .    2.4111758436332362
however , there is only a small number of studies investigating the effect of life events / life conditions in patients with severe depression from the endogenous subtype .    3.080574297692828
the present study examines the significance of the patients ' life events / life conditions for the two year outcome of the illness in a prospective study with assessments every three months .    2.863332618301637
patients are compared to healthy controls with regard to the period three months prior to the admission to the hospital at the index episode .    2.704247019690225
the results confirm the importance of life events and life conditions for the long term outcome of depressed patients with endogenous subtype respectively severe major depression in - patients .    2.593997617164046
relapsers show considerably more undesirable life conditions than non - relapsers three to six months prior to their relapse .    2.2245049030551955
depressed patients indicate significantly more undesirable life events and life conditions and fewer desirable life conditions in comparison to the control group for the time span three months prior to their hospitalisation .    2.4653995170627083
since the availability of protease inhibitors in 1997 , there has been a great change in antiretroviral therapy but also new long term side effects have emerged , mainly metabolic changes such as UNK , hypercholesterinemia and hyperglycemia .    2.2542755305453865
besides , fat redistribution has been observed .    2.361306425441708
fat UNK in the face and limbs but UNK in the adipose tissue of the UNK and abdominal region and the breasts .    3.857477627375528
the mechanism of these changes remains unclear .    2.8658066849698094
for therapy a protease inhibitor free therapy or lipid lowering drugs may be tried .    2.135597041267994
29 of our 224 patients developed UNK .    2.5159359637661325
27 of these patients had been treated with a protease inhibitor ( 17 patients with UNK ) ; 2 of the patients had never received protease inhibitors .    3.3707331230614175
background : the low - vision - enhancement - system ( UNK ) is the first binocular UNK rehabilitation device with variable focus distance .    2.7738465045262894
dna - cytophotometry is one of the methods that may contribute to a more precise evaluation of the biological behaviour of tumours in addition to the who - classification .    3.24794903284899
in this study 121 tumour specimens of 50 patients suffering from gliomas with one or up to three UNK were investigated .    2.376274102415569
in all cases the histological type and who - grade and the ki - 67 / mib1 labeling index were determined .    2.1071033990736057
dna cytophotometry was performed after single cell preparation on UNK - stained preparations , and the following parameters were calculated : stemline UNK , UNK - exceeding rate , and UNK - deviation index .    3.0746434996591137
there is a world - wide UNK of neurosurgical treatments of parkinson ' s disease ( pd ) , based on substantial progress in basic sciences .    2.245332161154015
a model of parallel motor UNK has identified potential targets for lesioning by clarifying the pathophysiological role of the basal ganglia in pd .    2.1716029056596793
the internal globus pallidus ( gpi ) is an essential UNK as it connects to UNK projections and can be disinhibited by overactivity of the nucleus UNK ( nst ) .    2.1988690341587827
lesioning of these targets has been successful in UNK damaged primates .    2.3033132120198654
there is clinical use of destructive as well as restorative and UNK UNK .    3.121364348470563
UNK and UNK have evolved by the use of better neuroradiological and electrophysiological targeting .    3.076647829657415
the first technic is used for treatment of rigidity , hypokinesia and dyskinesias , the latter one has proven to be efficient for tremor .    2.489168544217982
dopaminergic reinnervation and increased dopaminergic output of the striatum has only been seen after transplantation of fetal cells ; this method however carries immunological and ethical problems .    2.0727932737983874
the continuous high frequency stimulation of basal ganglia is the UNK technic ; it is highly UNK to the patient ' s need and carries a low morbidity profile .    2.7548666046590915
the stimulation of nst and gpi are proposed for dyskinesias and on / off phenomena .    1.9846656749238556
animal research further focuses on UNK and implantation of genetically transformed cells or pluripotent precursor cells .    2.2353077508318386
- in summary neurosurgical procedures seem to be UNK promising ; however longterm comparison studies are needed to define the best ( combination ) treatment ( s ) for the future .    2.538253835737664
concepts of documentation rely not only on the contents required and technical demands , but the procedures covered and in medical applications especially security aspects are also matters of critical concern .    2.1606715280399262
even though the need for effective documentation ( i . e . , adequate in content , availability , feasibility and easy to retrieve analysis ) is not a question , tasks and aims ( for example , quality of patient care ) deserve attention and establishing efforts have to be analyzed regarding their structural and personal prerequisites and implications before particular tools for documentation can be developed .    2.1505180180868018
once the mar is greater than the programmed mode switch rate the pacemaker mode switches to the nontracking mode .    2.0168375574145068
because the algorithm weights faster atrial rates more heavily than slow atrial rates , the algorithm is sensitive to a wide variety of atrial tachyarrhythmias , including those with varying amplitudes .    2.1515433332280214
additionally , the algorithm provides a long UNK and a rate adaptive ( ra ) av interval .    2.4201115060844742
these not only help ensure that a wide range of atrial rates will be detected , but may also limit the time the patient UNK at the upper rate before mode switching .    2.396636003343684
in order to assess the effectiveness of the algorithm , the thera - i provides detailed diagnostics which provide information on the date , time , duration , and rate of the mode switch episodes .    2.5208599846420343
additionally , more detailed beat - to - beat information is provided for each episode which can help determine its appropriateness and can assist in making programming changes .    2.0702564737816744
there is a lot of information in the literature about psychological disturbances in somatic diseases .    2.817317957558003
for dermatological patients such data are not available .    2.592589736853564
in early spring 1998 we studied the psychological changes in 247 hospitalized patients in the dermatological department of the ruhr university bochum .    2.328831915038795
we used the german version of the internationally accepted hospital anxiety and depression scale .    2.2835108926960106
we found the prevalance of psychological alterations ranged between 25 , 9 % and 31 % .    2.4129867612636104
the prevalence of psychological disturbances was a little higher than that seen in oncological , cardiological or neurological patient populations .    2.193249450320665
surprisingly skin cancer patients were less affected than patients with chronic inflammatory or UNK diseases .    2.6332146583484493
these results underline the necessity of improved psychological therapeutical strategies which must be standardized and evaluated .    2.181418526803591
in an analysis of 3 , UNK UNK car drivers , the proportion of acceleration related injury of the cervical spine increased from under 10 % in 1985 to over 30 % in 1997 .    2.8160987726092515
these injuries occurred mainly in the case of head - on or multiple collisions .    2.6352954074859265
letters were sent to 1 , 136 of the injured persons , and of the 138 patients who returned the questionnaires , 121 ( 88 % ) were still suffering from their symptoms .    2.375126658397291
it was a question of pain ( 74 % ) , tension ( 6 % ) and stiffness ( 5 % ) in the head ( 27 % ) , neck ( 55 % ) and shoulder ( 8 % ) area .    3.4155586490248724
the duration of the complaints was the longest after multiple collisions .    2.345478262141357
in addition to a slight influence of the accompanying injuries on the duration of complaints , the individual constitution seems to be an important determining factor .    2.9904622704450508
in order to resolve the difficulties of conducting of this retrospective study , prospective studies are necessary which include documentation of diagnosis , treatment protocols , duration and type of complaints .    2.4415433380457956
large b - cell neoplasms represent one of the most frequent groups of non - hodgkin - lymphomas ( 30 - 40 % ) .    2.908057846528365
they are characterised by an aggressive clinical course .    2.532480823217843
these lymphomas may evolve either de novo or secondary during the course of a less aggressive lymphoma .    2.3182071956790598
in addition to primary nodal , a primary extranodal manifestation is rather common .    2.2459026613893487
the neoplastic cells , even within one given case , show a broad morphological spectrum .    2.190507419958041
several findings of the last two decades have revealed that the large b - cell lymphomas represent an inhomogeneous group .    2.6797488499565096
this fact has been taken into account by the new who classification of malignant lymphomas .    2.557417775873577
there are two groups identified , that of the variants and that of the subtypes .    2.773720492790744
the various variants ( UNK , immunoblastic , anaplastic , t - cell / UNK - rich ) correspond to lymphomas without reproducible discriminating criteria lacking characteristic clinical , UNK and genetic findings .    2.488474605087046
in contrast , the primary mediastinal , the intravascular , the primary effusion and primary central nervous system lymphomas represent distinct disease entities .    2.1827963886753694
a number of recently described large cell lymphoma types , i . e . UNK , alk - positive and primary gastric , are included in the classification , their designation as distinct entities is still under discussion .    2.410109770053119
in the presented study , knee joint proprioception of 43 patients with a patellar pain syndrome of the knee joint was evaluated .    2.783722164032638
in a control group , the proprioception of 30 healthy volunteers with clinical and anamnestic UNK knee joints was examined .    2.4799440213715553
we tested the proprioceptive capability of the subjects with a passive angle reproduction test .    2.1627718244071685
additionally , all knee joints were measured with and without an elastic knee bandage .    2.5959896631952364
the patient group showed significant deterioration of angle reproduction capability ( 13 . 2 ° + / - 6 . 1 ° ) compared to the control group ( 7 . 8 ° + / - 2 . 8 ° ) .    3.305192806379726
after applying an elastic knee bandage , the angle reproduction capability significantly improved to 9 . 2 ° + / - 4 . 5 ° .    2.6403201690279197
proprioception of the contralateral , UNK knee joint in the patients ( 11 . 6 ° + / - 6 . 3 ° ) was worse compared to the control group .    3.267201432299108
applying an elastic knee bandage did not significantly improve the proprioception of the uninjured knee joint .    2.322555395108362
atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained arrhythmia in men .    2.915876546539106
it is associated with a two - fold mortality risk and an increased cost for health care providers .    2.8191644807521405
the relative UNK and the risks of pharmacologic approaches to atrial fibrillation therapy have contributed to increasing efforts to address atrial fibrillation with curative ablative strategies .    2.272904351727988
ablation approaches for atrial fibrillation focus on two UNK strategies : ablation of the substrate for initiation and ablation of the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation .    2.231472502984276
it has been demonstrated that atrial fibrillation may be initiated by repetitive atrial premature beats originating from a single focus .    2.4073080340976976
these ectopic foci can be mapped and ablated , thereby removing the substrate for initiation of atrial fibrillation .    2.0278768782498617
most often , these atrial premature beats arise from the pulmonary veins .    2.6387190461775902
a challenge in trying to ablate the trigger is actually having enough spontaneous activity from the said focus throughout the electrophysiologic study .    1.9428955665446483
to UNK the need of mapping , pure anatomic approaches are currently under investigation to electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the atrial myocardium by circumferential lesions .    2.3476885225843134
in patients without a defined trigger for atrial fibrillation , efforts were made to ablate the substrate for maintenance of atrial fibrillation .    2.315309335973071
strong evidence exists that atrial fibrillation is the result of multiple coexisting reentrant UNK requiring a critical myocardial mass to UNK .    2.3082425870568084
several working groups demonstrated that intraoperative UNK of the myocardial tissue by surgical incisions or radiofrequency pulses is highly effective in preventing atrial fibrillation .    2.2704045644465065
currently , attempts were made to reproduce the surgical technique using UNK , catheter - based approaches .    2.4138066966582388
using a time - budget method in a 3 year longitudinal study with a control group design , substantial reductions in the engagement of non - obligatory instrumental , social , and leisure activities could be found in a group of mildly to moderately demented patients .    2.2994176264337187
controlling these changes for differences in baseline UNK , the dementia - specific reduction was about 1 , 5 hours compared to a non - psychiatric control group .    2.710492884808397
these clinically relevant changes in activity levels underscore the importance of these activity domains with regard to the development of diagnostically useful indicators at the early stages of dementia .    2.627506255080685
time - budget methods seem to be particularly useful to close the diagnostic gap with regard to the assessment of everyday competence indicators especially at early stages of the dementia illness .    2.640836400564788
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy ( hcm ) is a disease with different etiological , morphological , functional , clinical and therapeutic aspects .    2.5612111570517206
recent investigations indicate that hcm is considerably widespread in the population ( 1 : 500 ) .    2.147452106124799
the causes seem to generate from familial or sporadic abnormalities ( mutations ) .    2.0244702573311777
depending on the clinical aspect , the complaints , and on the basis of morphologic and hemodynamic investigational results , we mainly have to consider two types of medical and surgical management .    2.7288268628921974
atrial fibrillation is in 20 - 50 % the most frequent dysrhythmia after coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) and a possible cause for UNK complications and prolongation off the medical treatment in patients .    2.7724615221678053
therefore , the effect of - blocking with metoprolol for prevention of supraventricular arrhythmias ( sva ) was investigated in a prospective and randomized trial .    2.742316924129102
200 patients after cabg were randomized in a drug and control group ( average age 63 . 2 years , 154 male , 46 female ) .    2.439990471922532
patients of the drug group ( n = 100 ) were treated with metoprolol ( UNK / kg / bw ) beginning on day one after operation , whereas patients of the control group ( n = 100 ) received therapy only in case of occurrence of atrial UNK .    3.088642726935045
ecg , blood pressure , and electrolyte concentrations were measured regulary until the tenth day after surgery .    2.499610944472971
reasons for exclusion were an ejection fraction ( < 30 % , sa - and av - block or simultaneous application of epinephrine and metoprolol .    2.276107848650388
there were no significant differences between the patients of drug and control group with respect to age , sex ejection fraction , previous medication , number and type of bypass grafts , cardiopulmonary bypass time , and perioperative ischemic events .    2.4001091246952315
however , a statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of supraventricular arrhythmias in both groups , 4 patients of the therapy group ( 4 % ) in contrast to 37 patients of the control ( 37 % ) developed supraventricular arrhythmias during the postoperative observation period ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .    3.005104196615146
both groups differed in total time of hospital stay by 1 . 5 days ( control group : 9 . 83 + / - 2 . 88 days ; drug group : 8 . 42 + / - 2 . 81 days ) , which was statistically significant ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.6480904560445904
all patients of the drug group could be discharged with a stable UNK , whereas 7 patients of the control group were discharged with persistent atrial fibrillation .    2.7335427923731555
the difference was statistically significant as well ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.3215922149879127
neither typical side effects of metoprolol , nor av - blocks , bradycardia ( f < 60 / min ) or symptoms of low blood pressure could be observed .    2.1404276013955816
the conclusion of this trial is a recommendation for a preventive application of 50mg metoprolol / day after coronary artery bypass surgery , which can reduce the incidence of sva as well as the hospital stay statistically significant .    2.6804057367662786
especially by using the " functional muscular diagnostics " described by UNK specific muscular imbalances can be found .    2.4664581921201303
the method is easy to apply and should be used during and before the UNK UNK .    3.104813347545059
background : angiotensin converting enzyme - inhibitors ( ace - inhibitors ) alter the function of the renin - angiotensin - UNK - system , which regulates the angiotensin ii synthesis .    2.4364526252918504
UNK ii is known to be a potent vasoconstrictor .    3.3994035338221686
ace - inhibitors are used as a standard treatment of arterial hypertension concerning the who - guidelines .    3.0512016384701393
the experiences concerning the use of ace - inhibitors in pediatric patients are limited .    2.9146966603069155
the frequency of side - effects are not known on a sufficient scientific basis .    2.771032820084238
evoked potentials ( ep ) are a valuable tool when assessment of neurocritical care patients is impaired by loss of consciousness and lack of co - operation .    2.5072517697585472
in this review we discuss ep studies in patients with thrombosis of basilar artery , space occupying cerebellar infarction and supratentorial mass lesions of different aetiology .    2.184826146051242
paclitaxel , a potent anti - tumor agent , shifts the cytoskeleton equilibrium towards assembly of altered and UNK stable UNK .    1.9421203247657013
these cellular modifications lead to reduced proliferation , migration , and signal transduction .    2.3203532038592942
it is highly lipophilic , which promotes a rapid cellular uptake , and has a long - lasting effect in the cell due to the structural alteration of the cytoskeleton .    2.8547181357377003
this makes paclitaxel a promising candidate for local drug delivery intended to address the proliferative and migratory processes involved in restenosis .    1.9678310313619984
in this article , results of our in vitro and in vivo studies with paclitaxel are presented .    2.3940421605698288
cell culture experiments with UNK of human arterial smooth muscle cells as well as UNK with human endothelial cells showed that paclitaxel leads to an almost complete growth inhibition within a dose range of 1 . 0 - 10 . UNK / l , even after a short ( 20 min ) single dose application .    2.6936966387046155
the comparison of an active , semi - active , and passive delivery system ( porous balloon , microporous balloon , and double balloon ) favored the double balloon for the following in vivo experiments .    1.9426195227271807
tubulin staining and electron microscopy enabled visualization of paclitaxel - induced vessel wall alterations .    2.1745419650660525
in the rabbit model , locally delivered paclitaxel resulted in reduced UNK formation and enlargement in vessel size ; in the pig model , however , after stenting , this inhibition was not significant .    2.145723266292363
both reduced proliferation and enlargement in vessel size contribute to a preservation of vessel shape and are likely to be caused by a structural alteration of the cytoskeleton , which is also supported by vascular contraction force experiments .    2.43530907581826
atopic eczema is one of the most frequent dermatological diseases , with a still increasing incidence .    3.0253378623212397
although its etiopathogenesis is still not completely understood , a variety of triggering factors are known .    2.620496557214231
the following case report describes the clinical course of atopic dermatitis in a 2 - year - old boy in whom both ige - mediated allergic reactions and psychological factors were involved in triggering and maintenance of skin lesions .    2.327967803197198
this demonstrates how important both dermatological therapy and close cooperation with the field of psychosomatic medicine can be .    2.4840278405707723
identity development in adolescence may act as stressor triggering juvenile psychotic episodes .    2.0839547603765753
a model is being presented UNK that self development in subjects with high vulnerability for psychosis leads to the establishment of an " imaginary self " consisting of phantasies and UNK without taking into account facts and social UNK .    2.0827444025656536
the " imaginary self " stabilizes irritating self deficiencies , thus leading to a vulnerability for depersonalisation and identity diffusion during actual UNK of adaptation .    1.919577599803151
biomaterials are defined as non - living materials which are used in interaction with biological systems .    2.482320666323267
especially in the field of UNK , biomaterials are applied in urinary diversion , urinary incontinence , erectile dysfunction , and as cosmetic prostheses .    2.777927600232783
biomaterial - tissue interaction is caused by the physical and chemical characteristics of the biomaterial , its degradation , and the resulting protein UNK .    3.0866583112399524
general requirements include biocompatibility and functionality and the avoidance of carcinogenic , UNK , toxic , and allergic reactions .    2.5209196665971865
this ist most important when there is permanent contact between urine and epithelial tissue , which may lead to UNK and UNK .    2.8116874565529213
continuous modification of known materials , inauguration of new materials , as well as the possibilities of tissue engineering will determine their development in the years to come .    2.5250795115983142
hitherto the question of an indication for psychoanalytic group psychotherapy has not been clarified sufficiently .    3.009598990466527
in this paper , under the UNK , that psychoanalytic group psychotherapy is a treatment mode in its own right , the issue is investigated which patients might best profit from the group treatment method .    2.144796849285136
it is pointed out that the group process itself contains a variety of therapeutic treatment factors which cannot be facilitated through psychoanalytic treatment of just one patient .    2.109105686225
first , a series of diagnostic , structural , motivational and cognitive indication criteria are discussed .    2.2601932391423816
second , the moments of a capacity for cohesion and aspects of social UNK are considered as helpful tools for a formulation of an indication .    2.091289221339153
as cohesion - according to group treatment outcome research results - has to be viewed as correspondent to the helpful therapeutic alliance , in the context of group psychotherapy , the UNK for indication is inextricably linked to patient selection and setting conditions .    2.5608737509200092
the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in renal transplant patients is important because unrecognized bacterial infection may lead - in the worst case - to graft loss .    2.2040019492810963
between january 1995 and january 1997 , we therefore obtained bladder catheter urine samples in 31 female allograft recipients when voided urine samples repeatedly showed pyuria ( > = 10 UNK per microscope field ( UNK ) and significant UNK ( > = ; 105 / ml ) combined with vaginal contamination ( UNK of squamous epithelial cells , mixed bacterial growth ) .    2.117476269498538
results : in 55 % ( 17 / 31 ) , diagnosis of urinary tract infection was confirmed by single bladder catheterization ; in 26 % ( 8 / 31 ) , urinary tract infection could be excluded , and in 19 % ( 6 / 31 ) , bladder colonization without pyuria was found .    2.3694028770306397
thus , 45 % of the patients with abnormal voided urine samples did not need UNK .    2.8232607037209205
after single dose antibiotic therapy with 500 mg ciprofloxacin , given immediately after catheterization , no infectious complications occurred .    2.0495625738166625
diagnostic single bladder catheterization is a simple , safe and - compared to UNK aspiration - barely invasive method for the diagnosis or exclusion of urinary tract infection in female renal transplant patients with higher risk for complications due to an acute bladder infection and non - conclusive voided urine samples .    2.4584318899139657
most people with the metabolic syndrome die from thrombotic complications superimposed to degenerative arterial vascular lesions , mostly myocardial infarction .    2.055641747564229
type - 2 - diabetes is a risk factor per se for such complications , but often clusters with UNK , hypertension and obesity .    2.5344296042924617
this is referred to as " metabolic syndrome " and often operates on a genetically programmed susceptibility which UNK the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease in front of a much wider diabetes specific UNK .    2.39036347396697
from a pathophysiological point of view none of these associated risk factors explains the pathogenetic series of events leading to the UNK of an occlusive thrombus at sites of complicated coronary plaques .    2.470513676707724
in patients with the metabolic syndrome the coagulation system is switched towards a UNK state , involving increased UNK coagulation , diminished fibrinolysis , decreased endothelial UNK and predominantly platelet UNK ( " diabetic UNK " ) .    1.981710465174553
some of these factors are associated with an increased coronary risk ( e . g .    2.58689704232307
fibrinogen , pai - 1 , platelets ) , but are also directly linked to the pathogenesis of " UNK " .    3.176957720682689
altered cardiac remodelling together with adhesion and coagulation mechanisms appears suitable to explain decreased functional performance of UNK organs , decreased success of acute ( reduced fibrinolytic response , no UNK phenomenon ) and longterm intervention strategies for vessel patency ( ptca , cabg ) in diabetes .    1.7830525483824409
glucose adjustment alone will not adequately neutralize these complex mechanisms , but in the situation of myocardial infarction UNK with parenteral glucose - insulin - potassium infusion appears mandatory similar to non - diabetics .    2.1824612319752976
on the longterm a multidimensional interventional repertoire is required particularly in patients with the metabolic syndrome including antihypertensive , UNK and antithrombotic drugs , UNK according to the individual patients needs as assessed by early diagnostic measures ( " early secondary prevention " ) .    2.4273091801798796
the indication for operative treatment in spondylolisthesis results from pain , progressive sliding and , in up to 60 % of the patients with progressive dislocation , from radicular malfunction .    2.7167638468511193
the posterolateral fusion in situ is a safe procedure , but the deformation remains and in spondyloptosis plastic deformation of the fusion mass can lead to further dislocation .    2.438582602329289
with the external fixator as an instrument for reduction and the internal fixator for stabilization the reduction of even serious spondyloptosis and the recovery of a normal spine alignement and posture is possible , with an acceptable neurological risk .    2.3655707690510437
therefore a concept of treatment is suggested , which as a rule is aiming at the anatomical reduction of the dislocated UNK beside stabilization and UNK decompression .    2.330524244713725
depending on the extent of the slip , reduction and stabilization is to be performed in one , two or three stages .    3.014564523053051
an anterior or posterior fusion is sufficient in grade i dislocation .    2.462726069572496
objectives : this study was conducted to evaluate a modified technique of UNK brachial plexus anaesthesia ( UNK ) and postoperative catheter analgesia for shoulder surgery .    2.7140161124715383
the original method described by UNK bears some rare but life - threatening complications ( inadvertent subarachnoid or intra - arterial injection , pneumothorax ) .    2.211891116762778
objectives : due to its low solubility and negligible metabolism , desflurane is assumed to be especially suitable for application by low - flow anaesthetic techniques .    2.3644913077429717
the aim of this clinical investigation was the development of a standardised dosing scheme for low - flow and minimal - flow desflurane anaesthesia .    2.6880521241711333
methods : one hundred six asa status i - ii patients were assigned to six groups according to the duration of the initial high - flow phase , fresh gas flow , and fresh - gas desflurane concentration .    2.4448346776270626
the median age , height , body weight , and constitution of the groups was comparable .    2.3708214930304488
after an initial high - flow phase using 4 . 4 l / min , the fresh gas flow was reduced to 0 . 5 l / min ( minimal - flow anaesthesia ) or 1 . 0 l / min ( low - flow anaesthesia ) .    2.77123627515277
inspired nitrous oxide concentrations were maintained at 60 % to 70 % .    2.4275844316556525
using different standardised schemes of vaporizer settings , inspired desflurane concentrations were applied in the range from 3 . 4 % to 8 . 7 % , i . e . , between 1 and 1 . 5 mac .    2.978872935001463
inspired and expired desflurane concentrations were measured continuously by the side - stream technique and recorded on - line .    2.274292513368776
venous blood samples were taken immediately prior to induction and 45 min after flow reduction for measurement of UNK ( cohb ) concentration ) .    2.430132226033874
results : in the 10 - to 15 - min initial phase during which a high fresh gas flow of 4 . 4 l / min was used , the inspired desflurane concentration reached values in the range of 90 % - 95 % of the fresh gas concentration .    2.6838939296751354
in low - flow anaesthesia this concentration could be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting , whereas in minimal - flow anaesthesia with flow reduction the fresh gas concentration had to be increased by 1 % to 2 % : the quotient calculated by division of the inspired desflurane concentration by its fresh gas concentration ( q = ci / cf ) ranges between 0 . 65 and 0 . 75 in minimal - flow and between 0 . 80 and 0 . 85 in low - flow anaesthesia .    2.4334676514528013
if use was made of the wide output range of the desflurane vaporizer , the inspired concentration could be increased rapidly by about 5 % in 8 min , although the flow was kept constant at 0 . 5 l / min .    2.2586119478943605
compared with its value prior to induction ( 2 . 13 + / - 1 . 05 % ) , the cohb concentration decreased statistically significantly by about 0 . 7 % during the 1st hour of minimal - flow anaesthesia ( 1 . 42 + / - 1 . 01 % ) .    2.9452857395497767
in no case was a cohb concentration observed that exceeded threatening or even toxic values , although the soda lime was changed routinely only once a week .    2.06544253281603
conclusions : the pharmacokinetic properties of desflurane , resulting in especially low individual uptake , and the wide output range of the vaporizer facilitate the use of low - flow anaesthetic techniques in routine clinical practice .    2.6575030500289976
even in minimal - flow anaesthesia , the duration of the initial high - flow phase can be shortened to min .    2.47510444149837
if the flow is reduced to 1 l / min , the inspired desflurane concentration achieved in the initial high - flow phase can be maintained without any alteration of the vaporizer setting .    2.3823167826413747
in minimal - flow anaesthesia , however , with flow reduction to 0 . 5 l / min , the fresh gas concentration has to be increased to a value 1 % - 2 % higher than the inspired UNK value .    2.954154545470027
due to the wide UNK range of the desflurane vaporizer , the amount of UNK delivered into the breathing system can be increased to about 110 ml / min even at a flow of 0 . 5 l / min .    2.5478468283756284
the large amount of agent that can be delivered into the system even under low - flow conditions , together with the very low individual uptake , results in a time - constant that is sufficiently short for the clinically required rapid increase in inspired desflurane concentrations .    2.336813572453937
the short time - constant of low - flow desflurane anaesthesia improves the control of the anaesthetic concentration .    2.874496766405928
if all measures are taken to safely avoid inadvertent drying out of the soda lime , there is no evidence that low - flow anaesthesia with desflurane is liable to increase the risk of accidental ca    2.751646293357878
arterial port systems are frequently used in the adjuvant and palliative therapy of colorectal hepatic metastasis .    2.523929443201638
specific complications are rarely documented in literature .    2.5770663597510293
the perforation of an arterial port - a - UNK followed by duodenal fistula is an uncommon complication of regional hepatic chemotherapy .    2.2988927277248288
besides systemic disorders caused by the chemotherapeutic agents , such as vomiting , sickness , or gastritis and UNK , UNK ulcers can occur as a local complication of treatment .    2.80103184445152
thrombosis of the hepatic artery or occlusion of the port device are the most common reasons for withdrawal of treatment in our series .    2.912364317868279
based on our experience and the case report of a duodenal fistula we recommend angiography of the port system prior to each cycle of chemotherapy .    2.408378202987538
background : coenesthesias can be defined as disorders of body perception or body hallucinations , projected in different parts of the body .    2.1997835411950093
patients complain of intractable pain or dysesthesia .    2.444614538697132
these symptoms are reported even from organs where we usually have no perception .    2.171655891819248
UNK must be regarded as a symptom that can be observed in various psychiatric diseases , e . g . , schizophrenia .    3.0127281525341907
however , in rare cases coenesthesias can be documented in neurological diseases , e . g . , intracranial tumors or infections .    2.376979628404181
therefore , accurate assessment of possible differential diagnoses is important .    2.3545608401585936
in late stages , coenesthesias can easily be recognized because of their " bizarre " character .    2.263093800561008
in early stages , however , patients often complain of intractable , UNK burning pain .    2.6572395621820086
they frequently undergo operations because of their great suffering .    2.598446612313561
the drug treatment of first choice is neuroleptics , but the results are unpredictable .    3.1278818364126315
question : what risks do different forms of immunosuppression ( azathioprine , cyclosporin , azathioprine / cyclosporin plus steroids ) represent in pregnancy for the mother and fetus after kidney transplantation ?    1.9330060598949177
retrospective analysis of 40 pregnancies and deliveries .    2.64193114190937
investigation of abortion - , premature birth rate , fetal retardation , malformation , hospitalization , UNK of labour , birth weight , gestational age , perinatal mortality , hypertonia , preeclampsia , anemia , kidney function , rejection crisis , mechanical compression , kidney function after 1 and 5 years postpartum .    1.9582989618432713
recommendation guideline : preconceptional time ( contraception ) and intensive care in pregnancy .    2.3462726420330924
the risk of pregnancy is justified if the UNK are correct and the woman would urgently like to have a child .    2.5777072814027497
studies on the everyday life of the elderly often deal with visible behavior .    2.5143992686310535
in this study , the subjective experience of the everyday living environment was investigated , paying special consideration to the role of mobility impairment .    2.470021977106149
two approaches , one oriented toward the subject ' s experience of the home environment , another oriented toward the environmental specifics of the individual ' s favorite place , were employed .    2.21548164932378
is the experience of living at home different for individuals with various UNK were found in the experience of cognitive , biographical , and spatial dimensions of the living environment .    2.464715113145786
similarities were found in the experience of emotional , social , and behavioral dimensions of one ' s home .    2.8252923539130466
competence loss played an important role in how the subjects experienced living at home , yet even the mobility impaired experienced their home as a environment which could be shaped .    2.114779419670246
the environment - oriented approach showed that the favorite place of mobility impaired persons was characterized by higher spatial density .    2.3952562629808987
finally , an examination of four home environment profiles using cluster analysis illustrated the connection between both person - and environment - oriented approaches and offered insights into a transactional perspective of person and environment .    1.8234917424084176
even though the subjective experience of one ' s home environment is not easily UNK in terms of maintaining everyday competence , it nonetheless UNK meaning to the elderly person ' s daily life .    2.1566591335987906
the main advantage of the bilateral medial rectus faden operation ( posterior fixation suture ) for the treatment of essential infantile UNK is the low occurrence of delayed consecutive UNK .    2.425062875739086
nevertheless , this unwanted complication also occasionally occurs after a faden operation .    2.109704852447962
we report the rare development of a myoepithelial carcinoma in a pleomorphic adenoma involving the minor salivary glands in the buccal mucosa of a 78 - year - old female .    2.258009413940363
tumor presented as a small asymptomatic left buccal mass .    2.425378707919425
the initial dominant component of the neoplasm was a pleomorphic adenoma , while the minor component was a myoepithelial carcinoma .    2.472219161309371
recurrences of tumor after 2 and then 5 years were excised .    2.5195098972712007
histopathological examination of the last tissue removed showed a pure myoepithelial carcinoma of the minor salivary glands without evidence for a pleomorphic adenoma .    2.7287342614891767
the clinical features , therapy , diagnosis , histopathology and literature are reviewed .    2.5031758847665486
the purpose of this prospective study was to determine concomittant lesions of glenohumeral dislocation and their correlation with the outcome , to determine the influence of various stabilizing operation techniques on the outcome .    2.7380308286920387
106 shoulders [ 104 patients , 81 men , 23 women , mean age 36 ( 16 - 83 ) years ] operated because of shoulder instability after at minimum one shoulder luxation between 1988 to 1995 were evaluated 3 years ( 0 . 8 - 8 years ) postoperatively using constant score .    2.164628882518504
preoperative arthroscopy was performed to document intraarticular lesions .    2.91121082709419
there were 7 UNK ( 5 because of a new accident ) , mostly after putti - platt procedures .    2.4679829894565386
the average modified constant score was 66 ( 10 - 85 ) points ( maximum 85 ) .    2.1945132546339536
29 patients ( 27 % ) had less than 60 points , mostly because of pain and restriction of function , and were evaluated as poor .    2.686042020129167
lesions of rotator cuff , long biceps tendon and subscapularis tendon had a bad prognosis .    2.1794184329019655
the severity of arthroscopically found lesions correlated with the outcome .    2.784103023878515
operations with shortening of subscapularis tendon or using a bone graft gave bad results .    2.181665180617728
anatomic reconstruction of the labrum - ligament complex in combination with a plasty of the extended capsule gave best results .    2.5319362599032673
preoperative arthroscopy can determine the extent of different lesions after shoulder luxation which influence the outcome and is useful to select the optimal operation technique .    2.345332042463502
prenatal determination of fetal blood groups by dna amplification today is possible for UNK d , ee , cc , UNK ( UNK / 2 ) , UNK ( UNK / b ) and UNK ( UNK / b ) .    2.9256999797311694
current assays using multiplex pcr and at least two specific primers as well as an intern control offer a diagnostic power of more than 99 % .    2.457601254790871
in all pregnancies complicated by irregular blood group antibodies , blood group typing in amniotic fluid allows to reduce the number of invasive procedures .    2.2653303617153893
pcr typing is recommended in all cases with a heterozygous father and an increased antibody level or suspicious findings during ultrasound evaluation .    2.458752391516845
adjuvant therapy with interferon for malignant melanoma causes neurotoxic side effects such as depression .    2.334589948309134
the biochemical mechanisms are unknown .    2.5849880655697954
we report two cases with both depression and amnesia .    2.3340326553555357
in one case , attempted suicide was a UNK by 7 h of amnesia .    2.3698429377743584
the diagnostic classification and possible explanations for the amnesia secondary to interferon therapy are reviewed .    2.1580065091813414
molecular and epidemiological studies have confirmed that human pathogenic UNK ( hpv ) types 16 and 18 are causally involved in the developement of carcinoma of the cervix .    2.1821053994911486
this statement is also true , albeit with reservations as yet , of other so - called high - risk hpv types , such as hpv 31 , 33 , 35 , 39 , 45 , 51 , 52 , 56 and 58 .    2.1832190791034654
around 500 , 000 women throughout the world become ill with carcinoma of the cervix every year , and 1 - 4 % of all younger women have a UNK of the cervix UNK .    3.0893322299200094
this knowledge of the viral origin of anogenital neoplasms has not yet been exploited for primary and secondary prevention of these illnesses , however .    2.6164338782390484
this is mainly because infection with genital hpv types is very prevalent in young women but seldom leads to carcinoma .    1.9034188225119648
in this review , therefore , the most important epidemiological data available on cervical carcinoma and its preliminary stages are analysed with reference to an association with hpv .    2.730233388499055
in conclusion , the significance of hpv for the prevention of carcinoma of the cervix is discussed .    2.6407392269602665
we report the case of a 43 - year - old woman who had a cardiogenic shock due to an acute inferior myocardial infarction .    2.4711483198605744
a prehospital emergency physician found ventricular fibrillation when he UNK after 20 minutes .    2.1586901492995207
it was impossible to achieve stable rhythm by 42 attemps of defibrillation .    2.1234476215239932
therefore , the patient was carried to our clinic under ongoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation .    2.6707388180564537
a UNK was informed with radio signal .    2.4922134826966613
percutaneous cardiopulmonary support ( pcps ) was implanted in the emergency department after 100 minutes of cardiac arrest .    2.395828801935855
after stabilizing the hemodynamic situation by pcps ( 4 - 5 l / min ) it was possible to transfer the patient to the catheterization laboratory .    2.589679991964469
angiography revealed proximal occlusion of a dominant right coronary artery .    2.4268191163777657
after successful angioplasty it was possible to reestablish stable sinus rhythm by single defibrillation .    2.387176789492403
by use of intra - aortic balloon pump ( iabp ) the flow rate of pcps was reduced every two hours .    2.1753562934103665
after 10 hours of support pcps was UNK .    2.4891593798820377
iabp was needed for three days .    2.6841838536644573
the patient was discharged from hospital without any relevant neurological deficits after nine weeks .    2.222509533294682
by using pcps it is possible to stabilize the patient ' s hemodynamic situation and to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures if other means of resuscitation do not suffice .    2.5120428011730143
the use of pcps in resuscitation is indicated in circulatory arrest if further therapeutic options seem promising .    2.2210590918440154
defects of the UNK complex subsequent to extensive tumor surgery or severe trauma often result in aesthetic and functional UNK .    2.675274551839012
the long - term results of rehabilitation related to different materials and techniques are the subject of this study .    2.846996799648033
from 1974 to 1996 altogether 127 patients with bony defects of the orbit and / or the skull base underwent surgery .    2.83437940791627
all patients ' data were documented prospectively from 1984 onwards .    2.233829261420292
eighty - one bony defects ( 64 % ) resulted from tumor resection ; 37 patients ( 29 % ) suffered from the effects of trauma .    2.3289122252579744
in 67 cases ( 53 % ) reconstruction was performed primarily , in 51 cases ( 40 % ) secondarily .    2.422799939222441
free or pedicled soft - tissue transplants were necessary in order to separate the orbit and the UNK in 26 % of the defects .    3.623743510152438
on the other hand , small , isolated defects of the orbital roof ( 7 % ) were left without any reconstructive procedure .    2.551512523733322
postoperative infections appeared in two cases ; loss of transplants was avoided entirely in the group of calvarian reconstructions in contrast to the UNK .    2.7065475228492923
the selection of a suitable donor site area and rigid fixation with UNK led to excellent esthetic results even in cases with large defects .    2.4655262442493577
within inpatient psychotherapy traditionally different therapeutic approaches are combined .    2.5197778158726996
usually verbal interventions of different UNK and settings ( e . g .    2.368202357957608
individual and group therapy ) , nonverbal procedures ( e . g .    2.2182526310692987
music and art therapy ) and UNK techniques are included .    3.158620120579294
the combinations is merely additive , integrated or UNK .    2.2342083610913503
little is known about the reciprocal interrelation of such combinations .    2.3813355993066434
along the example of a definite additive combination of psychodynamic and behavioural psychotherapy for UNK and obsessive disorders a rationale for the UNK of the different therapeutic components is discussed .    2.6657660845670255
the reason for this rare biochemical presentation are possible biologically active amino - terminal parathyroid hormone polypeptide fragments not detected by the widely used two - site immunoradiometric parathyroid hormone assay ( pth UNK ) .    1.8578421839399537
diagnosis and therapy of primary hyperparathyroidism therefore should not exclusively rest on the finding of hypercalcemia coupled with an elevated ipth level .    2.2747111170097245
viral hepatitis belongs to the most important infectious diseases worldwide .    2.9327938993558216
more than 300 million chronic hbsag carriers and chronic hcv carriers exist , respectively .    1.9839057020345627
high endemic areas of viral hepatitis are asia , africa , UNK america and the near , middle and far east .    1.9551109761571337
viral hepatitis is also very important in health care workers .    2.6586327963057634
today viral hepatitis can be differentiated from type a to type e ( g ) based on immunological and molecular assays .    2.282072299359641
while enterally transmitted hepatitis type a and type e only induce acute and rare fulminant disease , hepatitis type b , c and d often induce chronic progressive disease including liver cirrhosis with typical complications due to the portal hypertension and with a high rate of association with the development of primary liver cancer ( hcc ) .    2.336907150955767
this review focusses on viral hepatitis - related surgical problems , including liver transplantation .    2.098122600050549
hypertensive diseases in pregnancy ( hdp ) are one of the most frequent causes of maternal death and perinatal mortality .    2.3938961038184083
however , chronic hypertension without complications has a more favorable prognosis than preeclampsia .    2.2045660069375455
apart from a familial predisposition , mutations of various genes may also be responsible ; among these , apc resistance is of particular clinical significance .    2.4099935659477025
increased lipid oxidation , UNK membrane components of UNK , and increased invasion of fetal cells in the maternal circulation triggering immunological reactions are discussed as the causes .    2.7038402350766355
the result is an endothelial imbalance between UNK - UNK and UNK - UNK compounds .    3.852604904482503
the results of studies on the relevance of no synthase are controversial .    2.653343958824323
currently , neither reliable methods for the early detection nor certain UNK measures to avoid the disease are available .    2.4789723505759307
intensive care monitoring and therapy are essential for pregnant women with severe hdp .    2.760256110362875
the obstetric procedure depends on the severity and dynamics of the disease as well as the state of development of the baby .    3.809519497161935
when the pregnancy is continued defined guidelines for its termination for maternal or fetal indications must be taken into consideration .    1.9298414745974168
the risk for recurrence of the preeclampsia is between 20 and 26 % or when it occurred in the second trimester up to 65 % while that of hellp syndrome is between 3 . 5 and 24 % .    2.5897097602315142
acanthosis nigricans is a hyperkeratotic mucocutaneous eruption of heterogenous etiology which is characterized by hyperpigmentation , UNK cutaneous thickening , intensified skin UNK and development of verrucous UNK typically involving the intertriginous areas .    2.0151564511570292
malignant acanthosis nigricans is most often associated with an abdominal adenocarcinoma frequently unresectable at the time of diagnosis .    2.7711177844851416
we report on the rare association of acanthosis nigricans with a transitional cell carcinoma of the urinary bladder .    2.175459440098564
symptomatic treatment with topical calcipotriol significantly reduced the hyperkeratotic and papillomatous skin changes .    2.21714985247515
the goal of this evaluation study is to analyze the effects of a new gerontopsychiatric institution , the gerontopsychiatric center ( gc : a combination of a home - based outpatient service , a day - hospital and a consulting office for elderly with mental disorders ) on the reorganization process of the treatment system from intramural toward extramural structures , as experts of the government of the frg have been demanding for a long time .    2.2444167710609624
based on data of cross - sectional and longitudinal studies two regional catchment areas - the city of UNK ( without gc , control region ) and the district of UNK ( with gc ) - are compared and analyzed , whether changes within the gerontopsychiatric system ( subsystem a ) , the system of general medical treatment ( subsystem b ) , or within the elderly care system ( subsystem c ) occurred .    2.4129467905689563
concerning subsystem a the results are that the gc has a strong impact on the intended shift from intra - to extramural structures , without selecting patients by diagnosis nor by severity degrees of their mental disorders in extramural treatment facilities .    1.974010461388594
the home - based outpatient treatment is especially successful for elderly with a functional psychic disorder .    2.3366992037453103
these patients had the highest scores in improvement of psychiatric symptoms as well as in reduction of their self - care deficits within one year effects of the gc on subsystem b were evident soon after its establishment , for example , by the increasing cooperation between the gerontopsychiatric health services and general hospitals in the region with gc , in which ( hospitals ) two UNK of all clinical gerontopsychiatric patients with a mental disorder as the main diagnosis ( icd - 9 ) are treated .    2.520228717619862
an effect of the gc on subsystem c is possibly the fact that in its region the rate of direct transfers of patients from the clinical gerontopsychiatric department into homes for the elderly is significantly lower than in the region without gc .    2.5418197453713987
in the field of UNK it has become obvious that the immune system is governed by multiple influences from the central nervous system .    2.502491798949851
one approach to verify these interactions can be seen in stress research .    2.4512693025774346
while the phenomenon of stress - induced changes in immunological processes is widely accepted , more recent studies focus on possible UNK and mechanisms of these responses .    2.2816686039688645
within this research strategy it became evident that catecholamine increases upon stress are of a major importance for the frequently observed mild leukocytosis .    2.0855552756142255
the present study was conducted to investigate whether the often observed stress - induced increases in the number of peripheral lymphocyte subsets depends on the amount of epinephrine or norepinephrine release .    2.741018027257658
moreover , the question was addressed whether high or low catecholamine release is related to subjective ratings on discomfort .    2.1657516955510787
using a " public speaking paradigm " we were able to UNK previous findings of high increases in the absolute number of cd8 + and cd56 + cells in peripheral blood .    2.1148534587104915
moreover , when dividing subjects into high and low catecholamine responders , the amount of change was significantly larger in catecholamine responders irrespective of whether norepinephrine or epinephrine was used for grouping the subjects .    1.985605690600897
the data are discussed with respect to underlying mechanisms in catecholamine - induced lymphocyte migration and possible reasons for the mismatch between objective and subjective indicators of stressor efficacy .    2.1456809937109407
we report a locally recurrent retiform haemangioendothelioma ( rhe ) on the right great toe in a 40 - year - old woman .    2.2144599968195453
there was a secondary soft tissue lesion on her right lower leg .    2.3652704407930725
histologically , primary lesion , local recurrence and the secondary soft tissue lesion ( soft tissue metastasis ? )    2.340069062911398
long , arborizing , neoplastic blood vessels were lined by UNK and factor viii - positive , monomorphic endothelial tumour cells ; focally solid tumour areas , UNK and a prominent inflammatory infiltrate consisting of mature b and t lymphocytes were noted .    2.1274958188408593
the concept and the group of low - grade malignant vascular neoplasms is discussed , with special emphasis on inclusion of rhe in this category .    2.632147960515459
hmsn is a hereditary symmetric ascending neuropathy of the peripherial nerves .    2.1494455552507903
we describe a patient with hmsn type 1 and an incomplete peripherial 3rd nerve palsy of the right eye .    2.558200695071263
to the best of our knowledge , this is the first report of developed unilateral oculomotor disorder in a patient with hmsn .    2.273213191798707
a 34 - year - old male ( UNK cm / 100 kg ) was scheduled for surgery of the nasal septum .    2.606894080557446
he had had uneventful anaesthesia for UNK 14 years earlier : following 600 mg thiopentone , 180 mg suxamethonium and up to 2 vol . % halothane for 20 min had been used and no symptoms of malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) were recorded .    1.956742897611944
following oral premedication with 2 mg UNK at 7 . UNK a . m . anaesthesia was induced with a priming dose of atracurium at 8 . 45 a . m . followed by 0 . 2 mg fentanyl , 500 mg thiopentone , and 100 mg suxamethonium .    2.2295963737334303
endotracheal intubation was accomplished easily [ 9 ] , and the patient was ventilated UNK in a semi - closed circle system until spontaneous ventilation resumed .    2.685674689168373
enflurane ( 1 . 5 % for 5 min , 1 . 0 % for 10 min , and 0 . 8 % until the diagnosis of mh was suspected ) was given in 33 % o2 / 66 % n2o .    3.1929495379171904
seventy minutes after induction it was noted that the spontaneous respiratory rate and minute volume had risen continuously from 10 / min and 6 l / min , respectively , to 20 / min and 12 l / min .    2.360111778175883
attempts at UNK anaesthesia with repeated doses of fentanyl up to a total dose of 0 . 95 mg failed to reduce the hyperventilation .    2.6067735048546647
in spite of a high fresh gas flow of 6 l / min and assisted manual ventilation , the fio2 started to fall from 0 . 34 to 0 . 28 at 10 : 20 a . m .    2.306457680188822
the o2 / n2o ratio was changed to 1 : 1 , but the fio2 remained at 0 . 3 .    3.1628612623242804
mh was suspected , enflurane was discontinued , and an arterial blood gas analysis was done ( table 2 ) .    2.484073162690069
when marked acidosis and hypercarbia were found , UNK 2 . 5 mg / kg was given , the operation was terminated , and the patient ' s trachea was extubated and he was monitored closely in the intensive care unit for 24 h . vital signs were stable ( table 3 ) and no further complications were observed .    2.618702951618491
the patient did not mention pain or uneasiness postoperatively .    2.246411495033023
about 6 months later , a muscle biopsy was done according to the european mh protocol [ 5 ] and the patient was found to be UNK .    3.090322638807272
in this case five main reasons for the hypercarbia and mixed acidosis must be considered ( table 1 ) .    2.372576693776877
firstly , hypoventilation does not seem to be reasonable as the patient was ventilated with 8 to 12 l / min , which is within the range of 80 - 120 mg / kg - min .    2.9962586801201874
secondly , we can exclude shock and hypoperfusion because the patient had a normal blood pressure and heart rate ( within 65 - 90 beats / min ) , his UNK and skin were well perfused , his body temperature was 37 °c , and there was no sign of muscle rigidity .    2.370674059979429
UNK , a defect of the co2 UNK as well as co2 admixture to the n2o and o2 ventilation gases can cause hypercarbia .    2.426303967906688
we use two absorbers in sequence of which one is changed every day , and found neither a change in colour of the indicator nor an abnormally raised temperature of the absorbers [ 11 ] .    2.0197165904397614
a postoperative check of the ventilator showed no defect in the o2 / n2o supply and a correctly functioning anaesthesia apparatus .    2.0233403393319738
a malfunction of both co2 absorbers resulting in intraoperative hypercarbia could not explain a postoperative mixed acidosis lasting for more than 6 h . UNK performed at the same time using soda lime from the same UNK were totally uneventful .    2.306738845335233
a thorough postoperative examination by an UNK did not reveal any thyroid , pulmonary , endocrine , or circulatory reason for our intra - and postoperative findings .    2.314505320113048
iatrogenic factors like superficial anaesthesia or systemic side effects of adrenaline admixture to local anaesthetics can cause hypermetabolism without striking clinical signs , but they do not cause mixed acidosis lasting longer than 6 h ( table 2 ) .    2.1407182930477964
the most suitable explanation in this case is an UNK form of mh .    2.8826309094843765
introduction : avoidance of extracorporeal circulation during beating heart surgery ( op UNK = off - pump coronary artery bypass surgery ) for aortocoronary bypass grafting ( UNK ) is gaining increasing importance in modern cardiac surgery .    2.259028203766005
especially high - risk patients with multiple risk factors for open heart surgery will profit from this approach , because the negative effects of the extracorporeal circulation are avoided .    2.8890779180937027
although dementia is described as one of the UNK characteristics of normal pressure hydrocephalus ( nph ) , UNK gait disturbances and urinary incontinence , there is a rather limited number of controlled studies concerning neuropsychological deficits in the disease .    2.9005418786944244
a wide range of UNK relevant symptoms have been described , but the common features of most cases include mental and motor slowing , apathy , emotional UNK , UNK , memory and attentional impairment .    2.5435932734409974
a number of other functional deficits such as UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK can also frequently be found .    3.2796151248394545
some emphasis is put on the work of j . de UNK ( UNK ) which appears to be most important for the study of neuropsychological symptoms in nph patients .    2.7860529090102983
the methodological standard of a number of studies has been found to be rather low , and yet a sound neuropsychological investigation may be of utmost importance for the diagnosis and neurosurgical outcome assessment .    2.865530169289869
concerning morphological correlates of the functional deficits in nph , various hypotheses have been formulated , but it is argued that symptoms can neither be described as predominantly " diffuse " in nature , nor can they be reduced to UNK dysfunctions .    2.1153751452993026
recommendations for future research strategies are formulated .    2.7686369908591475
up to now there are no published results of therapy of UNK ( UNK , UNK ) and sexual aggressive impulsiveness with lhrh - ( UNK hormone - releasing hormone ) agonists in the UNK countries .    2.919406437980284
in this report we describe 11 patients which were treated with the lhrh - agonist UNK acetate in a period of 12 months .    2.642254275614564
the patients showed no tendency of UNK aggressive behaviour and reported an evident reduction of penile erection , ejaculation , UNK , sexual deviant impulsiveness and phantasies .    2.164996701274008
one patient died from suicide .    2.8528339823413975
in combination with other treatments lhrh - agonist seem to be a very promising alternative to UNK acetate and its possible UNK effects .    2.5787637654432656
aim of the study : to investigate the long - term effect of tnfr55 - igg1 in patients with severe rheumatoid arthritis refractory to multiple previous UNK treatments .    2.8414612828807817
methods : between 1994 and 1995 we recruited 80 patients for two double blind , placebo - controlled multicenter trials .    2.2086568484186424
all patients were treated for 2 - 30 months with a UNK fused protein consisting of two human UNK tnf receptors linked to a human igg1 - UNK .    2.3014725620362775
the dose range was 2 . 5 - UNK / month given i . v .    2.8969471066954298
with cumulative doses from 40 - UNK .    2.453901953821354
all patients were followed - up prospectively for 24 - 36 months after initiation of therapy .    2.481437931054469
the evaluations included a 48 swollen and tender joint count , esr , crp , rf , ana , UNK , and safety parameters at 6 month intervals .    2.104376394631544
in addition , pharmacokinetics , tnf , and anti - tnfr55 - igg1 antibody levels were available after the first and third injection .    2.210254785159953
results : data from 80 patients are available representing an experience of more than 170 patient years ; 11 patients are still being treated .    2.2945730251227836
predominant reasons for treatment withdrawal were restrictions in treatment protocol .    2.29827852319082
six patients died ( 1 during treatment , 5 in the post - treatment follow - up ) .    2.9036007106583615
all deaths were related to preexisting cardiovascular disease except one post - surgery septic arthritis 6 months after the last dosing ( during vacation in another country ) .    2.0557690535343793
anti - tnfr55 - igg1 antibodies correlated with a decrease in drug half - time .    2.4275295302018036
a lupus nephritis occurred 18 months after the last dosing in one patient with erosive ra ( ana and UNK positive already before tnfr55 - igg1 initiation ) .    2.147699389983561
continued treatment for 3 years in 11 patients resulted in an 81 % reduction in swollen joint count , less morning stiffness , less pain , and a reduction in steroids .    2.565111802602061
conclusion : treatment with tnfr55 - igg1 is safe and efficacious over the long - term in patients with severe refractory ra .    2.7708927620812718
for both UNK and as UNK UNK , visual assessment is the major source of information for the pilot .    3.2388891229209125
the new possibilities for change of refraction by means of corneal refractive surgery have led to an increasing demand from pilots for these new methods .    2.4222259845710505
can these methods successfully be applied for aviation purposes ?    2.339549149719097
the valid regulations for medical standards of pilots , as well as the future international regulations such as UNK and UNK , are explained in this respect .    2.8892629301624635
a report is given on the work of the advisory board of the german federal government air traffic UNK and on the cases treated so far and their outcome , and recommendations are expressed .    2.399718686970278
concerning the legal situation and clinical experience , advice for pilots , aviation medical examiners and UNK is given .    2.2071861787341374
persistent remnants of the caudal müllerian ducts can manifest in several forms and are often associated with other urogenital disorders , especially UNK .    2.284041859061786
inadequate activity of the müllerian inhibiting factor , in addition to fetal testosterone deficiency , is responsible for this syndrome .    2.6661440510078105
the etiology , diagnosis and management of müllerian duct remnants are discussed .    2.4338452818410516
a complex case of penile - scrotal UNK , hypoplastic prostate gland , testicular UNK and UNK cyst is presented .    2.307679892879978
the official german guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia were published by the bundesgesundheitsamt , now called robert - koch - institut , twelve years ago .    1.8255607083118743
the recently published official " guidelines for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia " of the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) are categorized according to scientific evidence .    1.832021792910394
the american guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the official german guidelines .    1.9392649220461367
the purpose of the present paper is to inform the german anaesthesiologist about the official cdc guidelines and to provide a renewed background for the prevention of nosocomial pneumonia .    2.2721245709933293
at present , the importation into germany of life - threatening and highly UNK diseases such as UNK UNK and UNK is unlikely , but cannot be ruled out .    2.833419036588508
in spite of the extreme rarity of these diseases , guidelines are necessary to prevent the spread of these agents in case of their importation .    2.720862595495592
in germany , marked regional differences exist with respect to the development of emergency regulations and the availability of specialized centers for diagnostics and therapy .    2.6684575526071233
a federal framework is missing .    2.5216151497794392
a concept is presented here in which the capacity to respond is substantially augmented with limited additional cost through inter - regional cooperation using existing infrastructure and UNK standardized procedures .    1.9374195370367098
the therapeutic effect and the side effects of fumaric acid derivatives used in treatment of psoriasis vulgaris have been subjects of controversy for more than 30 years .    2.5544879380218415
a total of 83 patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris were investigated in as UNK - centre , long - term open ( 12 months ) clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety profile of the fumaric acid UNK preparations fumaderm initial and fumaderm .    2.4941956438148845
the UNK effect of the fumaric acid derivatives was clear , with a mean reduction of 76 % in pasi .    2.755560212903026
adverse events in were noted in 62 % of the patients ( mainly flushing and gastrointestinal complaints ) .    2.6432106081057727
we believe that of fumaric acid derivatives are indicated in cases of severe therapy - resistant psoriasis to and can be used even for long - term application .    3.0029725157763476
background : because retinal necrosis syndrome seldom occurs , we present our results of silicone oil tamponade for associated retinal detachment .    2.0889133665772857
the eyelids are the site of many different pathological conditions .    2.692551646430514
this publication deals with the pathophysiological and anatomical basis of eyelid swelling and mainly provides a practical approach for differential diagnosis with the help of flow and short UNK of possible causes .    2.3390500403415992
the subjective complaints of the patient charts ( pain , pruritus ) are shown to be important criteria for orientation .    2.995628357778754
special interest is focussed on allergic diseases and atrophic conditions as causes of eyelid swelling .    2.1461910792800096
additional retrosternal masses were proved .    2.591485361390273
progression in the left upper lobe occurred in spite of antibiotic therapy ; infiltrations of the right lower lobe were seen .    2.8821141310873837
no germs could be identified .    2.762001903514798
bronchoscopy and UNK showed no pathological findings .    2.7047862790642925
his general health became worse , and the patient died under the clinical diagnosis of " wandering pneumonia " with finally suspicion of fulminant pulmonary artery embolism .    2.5627749095513592
autopsy findings revealed an advanced stage of pulmonary artery sarcoma with myocardial infiltration and metastases in both kidneys and thyroid gland .    2.099192096116528
general manifestation of pulmonary artery sarcoma usually are symptoms similar to those caused by pulmonary artery embolism with obstruction of pulmonary arterial flow .    2.2583215735950706
the unusual constellation of clinical findings similar to UNK pneumonia results in secondary infection due to tumorous pulmonary infarction .    2.0676750251284948
the difficulties in diagnosis by biopsy are caused by primary intravascular growth of the neoplasms .    2.477137104360866
therefore early diagnosis in an operable tumor stage by means of ct , mr , and angiography is very important .    2.630238880796805
definition of the problem : is it the brain that makes a human being a person ?    2.162437520971653
this anthropological question has been raised because of the findings of modern human brain research , and there are severe ethical consequences UNK : if the appropriate anthropological answer is yes , then all invasive research would be problematic , because one would touch the basis of human essence .    2.16830139657872
the problem is that the two major philosophical paradigms that offer an answer to the anthropological question , UNK and UNK , have opposing concepts .    2.555308926645967
arguments : this paper argues that the error of these two paradigms is that they understand the human body and the human mind as ' res ' - as things .    2.21166982713954
the explanation of the human being as an interactive unit of body and mind is impossible in both paradigms .    2.381816012398608
a third anthropological view that tries to make that UNK is the UNK of the hebrew UNK .    2.9233710857674833
it does assume the category ' thing ' while speaking about humans , it UNK the category ' aspect ' .    2.073114257608462
the UNK language only knows terms for the unity of human beings seen under a certain aspect .    2.029436870209698
conclusion : here , the body and thus the brain are important and necessary condition for human essence , but this is not a sufficient explanation for the human personality .    2.5256426630860473
invasive research on the human brain is here neither generally UNK nor tolerated - one has to demonstrate in every single case whether the planned operation UNK regions that are crucial for the personality of the human subject .    2.212666531318438
introduction : in recent studies we identified two morphological phenomena in the facial nucleus of the brainstem that play an important role in the recovery of facial movement : hyperinnervation and misdirected reinnervation .    2.079985515167047
while the hyperinnervation could easily be quantified by cell UNK , the extent of misdirected reinnervation could not be estimated accurately .    2.86425139074467
in the present study we developed a method for accurate quantification of this misdirected reinnervation .    2.4578517367476738
a 50 year old female patient received anaesthesia of the arm by the vertical UNK blockade of the plexus brachialis ( vip ) .    2.360418508378733
postoperatively an ipsilateral pneumothorax occured complicated by pleural effusion and a contralateral bronchopneumonia , which resolved completely after treatment .    2.0318231958628235
the blockade of the plexus was performed correctly , failures in determining the correct point of needle insertion could be excluded .    2.1576723584079405
therefore a pneumothorax has to be regarded as a specific complication of the vip , which might occur despite correct technique , and requires that the patient be informed of this UNK .    2.5226028188921594
nevertheless , the vip is an important method due to its high success rate concerning blockade of the musculocutaneous nerve and tolerance of tourniquet .    2.44002707802514
the risk of a pneumothorax is about 0 . 2 to 0 . 7 % .    3.7254135138825895
the routine application of ultrasound in pregnancy has had an important impact on perinatal medicine .    2.433665604320005
new trends in perinatal medicine , aiming at more individual and self - determined pregnancy and delivery , are UNK because of the safety provided by ultrasound .    2.413435269603203
often prenatal ultrasound is regarded as only being able to detect fetal malformations , but ultrasound provides many more benefits for a safe pregnancy : early detection of fetal viability ; intrauterine localization of the pregnancy ; exact determination of the gestational age in early pregnancy ; later in pregnancy , confirmation of appropriate fetal growth , position and localization of placenta site .    2.0412147138347
in addition , the development of close mother - child bonding by visualizing the fetus could be of positive impact .    2.286834541210542
these aspects are contributions of ultrasound to a gentle and safe pregnancy and delivery for mother and child .    2.2369858495978705
for routine evaluation of ureteropelvic junction obstruction in children , sonography , voiding cystogram , iv pyelogram and a renal scan in combination with administration of furosemide are available .    2.126053386354739
furthermore , often preoperative antegrade or retrograde ureteropyelography is performed .    2.152191174866076
therefore , we reviewed the records of 41 children who underwent a pyeloplasty in our department .    2.3551745811045914
in 9 children the ureter was visualized by iv pyelogram , voiding cystogram or antegrade ureteropyelography ; a retrograde examination of the ureter was performed in 21 children before pyeloplasty in the or .    2.1828629894551304
retrograde UNK neither gave additional information in any patient nor did it change the operative technique .    2.3314007390531173
hence , we conclude that retrograde ureteropyelography before pyeloplasty in children is not necessary , provided that sonography does not show ureteral dilatation .    2.4667848594683957
we report on a patient with multicentric juvenile UNK , whose unusual clinical and histological pattern initially obscured the diagnosis .    2.204074983321335
spontaneous remission of the tumour , which has now been maintained for over 2 years , the change from the primary UNK UNK appearance to a UNK histiocytic picture with multiple fat - UNK giant cells , and the lacking demonstration of specific cell UNK finally allowed the nature of the disease to the definitely diagnosed .    2.6693070314980183
in children with horseshoe kidneys wilms ' tumors can be observed 2 to 8 - times more often .    2.434639265709621
wilms ' tumors are malignant mixed tissue tumors that seldom show large parts of fatty tissue .    2.076503439120848
we report about a 28 - month - old girl with an unusual wilms ' tumor in a horseshoe kidney which according to radiological criteria could have been a teratoma because of its large lipomatous part with internal calcifications .    2.1258051464215577
the radiological characteristics of these differential diagnoses are presented in different cross - section UNK .    2.27206073536424
both differential diagnostic considerations correlated with the histologic diagnosis of a UNK wilms ' tumor .    3.106101911430723
gene therapy in orthopedic surgery is a new technic based on the idea of biological tissue healing .    3.017849051729299
external gene segments are transferred to cells that UNK growth factors locally to achieve this effect .    2.2475423182516563
the influence of growth factors on fracture healing is very well documented in the literature .    2.5855865835361005
gene transfer is a promising , new technic of in situ tissue engineering that will enter clinics within the next decade .    2.2114542740664964
biomechanical investigations of the mandible are difficult to perform due to a variety of conditions involved .    3.4541507886179015
for the appropriate reconstruction of biomechanical properties , a geometrically correct body model has to be established which UNK to complex in vivo conditions .    2.3746549948959506
the aim of our study was to evaluate the use of finite - element models ( fem ) for the assessment of mandibular deformation under mechanical loading .    2.3947308604008044
explanted human mandibles ( n = 5 ) were investigated by strain UNK to determine the individual strain distribution under mechanical loading .    2.7464352379359194
fem analysis based on a computed tomograph ( ct ) was performed and the results were matched with the test data .    3.10706992270713
our study demonstrates only minor interindividual differences in the strain distribution for each load studied .    2.3164153790056656
the mechanical response in terms of deformation was found to depend mainly on gross geometrical properties and to a minor extent on the various other variables .    2.3248310966291186
at all positions the maximum principal strain was tensile , the minimum principal strain was compressive , and the absolute strain values were correlated with the magnitude of the applied force .    2.3509722369184383
hence , fem analysis is a non - invasive tool in the prediction of biomechanical behaviour of individual mandibles and therefore may help in trauma reconstruction and treatment planning .    2.5084273102807764
UNK is a rare syndrome characterized by growth retardation and peripheral dysostosis .    2.6908690368690706
70 % of affected patients exhibit mental retardation .    2.999391729314248
inheritance occurs in an autosomal - dominant pattern .    2.7712632284134875
the genetic defect is not known .    2.8706833306503556
therapeutic strategies in the treatment of pancreatic carcinoma are based on the high number of non - resectable cancers , the high relative UNK and the high distant metastases rate .    3.5076035827125436
even in curatively resected carcinomas , a locally effective treatment modality is needed because of the risk of microscopical residual disease in the UNK tissue .    3.0139589214021263
the efficacy of radiotherapy is dose dependent .    2.6333038676377716
based on an analysis of published data a dose of more than 50 gy is recommended , resulting in a high morbidity rate with external beam radiotherapy alone .    3.0172901403906853
the use of intraoperative radiotherapy allows locally restricted dose escalation without increased perioperative morbidity .    2.1436476953726267
with palliative intent , pain relief was obtained rapidly in over 60 % of patients and led to improved patient performance .    2.6408218675735835
as a result of the high distant metastases rate , even in curatively resected carcinomas , the overall prognosis could not be significantly improved .    2.708543002012099
further dose escalation is limited by the increasing incidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding ( 20 - 30 % ) .    2.6616134594190144
malignant tumors of the head and neck region are amongst the six most often occurring tumors of the body .    2.8709832268778936
they can be associated with the different anatomical compartments as well as different histologic types .    3.4421293287466765
these compartments can be separated into the nasopharynx , the oropharynx , and the hypopharynx .    2.641334534663483
most of the malignant tumors belong to the squamous cell carcinomas , other histologic types are depicted less frequently .    2.493875340737087
the histologic types of the other groups which are seen more often comprise of lymphomas and UNK carcinomas .    2.258246525373619
the undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx is supposed to be a special type of tumor .    3.0976190262903214
the malignant tumors of the pharynx can also involve all three compartments .    2.7204054747498394
beside these tumors , malignancies of mesenchymal origin can also be delineated .    2.542076608796586
while there are quite a number of reports on vascular injuries complicating hip UNK by acetabular component screw fixation , retractor tip pressure or UNK bone cement , the incidence of deep femoral vessel injuries in operative fixation of proximal femoral fractures is comparatively seldom described .    2.09933997059894
we report on two patients with per - and UNK femoral fractures who sustained injuries of deep femoral artery branches during the implantation of a dynamic hip screw ( dhs ) and a dynamic condylar screw ( dcs ) , which resulted in a massive thigh hematoma and a UNK - size pseudoaneurysm respectively and necessitated surgical intervention in either case .    2.349422687597234
we UNK these vascular injuries on the pressure of UNK UNK UNK the femoral bone or on the drilling of UNK for plate UNK .    2.766186418687169
after UNK various operative procedures , we conclude that UNK implants are safer than plates with regard to potential vascular complications .    2.4645590104355173
cleft lip and UNK ( clp ) are caused by a variety of factors .    3.507602397042329
ionizing radiation is only one of these factors .    3.270928801965014
the UNK of the nuclear reactor at chernobyl on april 26 , 1986 , and the subsequent radioactive fallout did not cause any acute radiation sickness in germany .    2.34140082116772
in our study we analyzed the influence of the radioactive fallout after the chernobyl disaster on the rate and regional distribution of clp newborns in the former german UNK republic ( gdr ) .    2.244826598343253
in contrast to the federal republic of germany an ongoing malformation register for clp newborns had existed in the former gdr since 4 july 1967 .    1.9463672392016418
environmental data were collected from national and international environmental authorities and atomic energy UNK .    2.304841174466285
population statistics were taken from the statistical UNK of the former gdr .    3.315545329380257
during a 10 - year period from 1980 to 1989 , the average number of clp newborns in the gdr was 1 . 88 per 1 , 000 live births .    2.4510562120470993
a significant prevalence increase was recorded in 1983 , 1987 und 1988 .    2.1464115263334884
in comparison to the mean rate in the period from 1980 until 1986 , 1987 demonstrated an increase of 9 . 4 % .    2.909731009173944
regional prevalence increases were seen in the three northern districts of UNK , rostock and UNK , where the radioactivity measurements in general showed higher levels of the UNK UNK - 137 und strontium - 90 than in other districts .    2.9557363193789667
owing to the comprehensive malformation register for clp patients in the gdr , this is the first study for germany , analyzing the clp rate before and after the fallout in chernobyl .    2.4184612995315247
the results support the UNK of the influence of radiation - induced increase of clp newborns after the chernobyl reactor accident .    3.0108095403708406
the median survival time for patients with disseminated malignant melanoma is 5 - 7 months ; it is still not really known whether therapeutic measures prolong survival .    2.67344012554897
the aim of the present investigation was to identify patients with prolonged survival in stage iv disease and to analyse the possible impact of therapy on the course of the disease .    2.3425761343363907
in the department of dermatology , UNK UNK university medical centre at the free university of berlin , UNK patients with were diagnosed as having stage iv melanoma and enrolled in a computer - based registry between 1970 and 1993 .    2.3358877170948897
there were 48 patients who received both systemic and local therapy .    2.7211530056753492
on the other hand , 111 patients received no treatment .    2.2226614856954052
twenty two patients were identified survived longer than 24 months ( median survival time 33 months ) .    2.6962154899365482
none of the patients who had received no treatment survived for 2 years or longer .    2.9374435699263257
the 22 patients with prolonged survival were treated by multimodality included 16 who had received both systemic treatment and surgery and / or radiation , while 3 had had only systemic drug therapy and another 3 , only local treatment .    2.3467452702333675
twelve of the 22 patients became tumour free after their initial surgery or radiation .    2.1786307008404324
active therapy in disseminated melanoma with reduction of tumour mass by surgery and radiation and with systemic medical treatment may lead to prolonged survival in a considerable percentage of patients .    2.29025975229381
background : the use of intravenous heparin is essential for the treatment of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction .    3.2823463637918997
a significant rebound of thrombin generation within 6 to 10 hours after termination of heparin infusion has been reported .    2.159666336163782
this time window is clinically critical as the incidence of recurrent ischemia peaks in this period .    2.5101630592196096
it has therefore been recommended to gradually UNK heparin infusion continously rather than to discontinue it abruptly .    2.0703898337807387
however , it is not known which dosing procedure is useful and whether it UNK reduces thrombin rebound .    2.36228088203817
the use of porcine skin as a biomedical model for the human UNK is discussed with reference to the literature .    2.760160126426098
the epidermis and dermis can be used as a model as there are clear structural , functional and biochemical similarities with human skin layers .    2.2618940892245263
the actual utilization of porcine skin in dermatological research is reviewed .    2.25798401832284
laparoscopic procedures have attained increasing importance in the diagnosis and therapy of carcinoma of the cervix in recent years ( table 1 ) [ 34 ] .    2.996334297638072
laparoscopic pelvic and para - aortal UNK are therefore performed to assess the operability of carcinoma of the cervix and for its staging .    2.426781082843944
in the case of primarily operable tumours , paraortal and pelvic lymphadenectomy is carried out by a laparoscopic procedure , and when the lymph nodes are negative nodes and there is no intra - abdominal metastasis the lymphadenectomy is combined with laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy .    2.372739811052057
if laparoscopy UNK positive lymph nodes , debulking can be carried out and the patient can be referred for radiotherapy .    2.6804651777413078
in addition , laparoscopic procedures , even in combination with radical UNK for early invasive carcinoma of the cervix , can mean conservation of the patient ' s fertility .    2.7465689201328827
in the case of primarily inoperable tumours laparoscopy can be used to assess the lymph node status and the intra - abdominal tumour spread and to classify the patient ' s condition as potentially secondarily operable or inoperable .    2.50034024785268
the efficacy of buprenorphine in opioid dependent patients ( n = 20 ) was compared to methadone maintained subjects ( n = 20 ) in a randomized comparison trial .    2.754896396189423
sublingual application of buprenorphine as an alternative UNK opioid is being compared to methadone during a 24 week study period .    2.208653547833882
a trend ( p = 0 . 06 ) could be found in the retention rate of investigated patients being maintained on a mean dosage of 63 mg oral applicable methadone ( UNK of l - and d - methadone ) in comparison to the group on a mean dosage of 7 , 3 mg buprenorphine ( sublingual tablets ) .    2.2949790636464114
the dropout - rate of 11 subjects at the end of the study in the buprenorphine group was higher when compared to the dropout - rate of 5 in the methadone group .    2.6639206230152332
there was no significant difference between the two groups over the treatment period in respect to additional consumption of opiates , benzodiazepines and cocaine as evaluated through urine toxicology .    1.9100811238914464
the result in regard to compliance over the study period demonstrates that methadone appears to be the more successful oral opioid ( p = 0 , 04 ) .    2.573881559662085
nevertheless , efficacy of buprenorphine in maintenance could be demonstrated in the remaining subjects , and further studies with higher daily doses and a higher number of subjects have to be performed .    2.5969423438327035
in patients with pleural or peritoneal mesothelioma , surgery is a technically difficult procedure .    2.4506168925507206
whereas those rare forms of localized pleural UNK are being detected incidentally and can be cured by complete resection , most patients with diffuse malignant mesothelioma present with an advanced stage of disease .    2.254016035683424
most of these patients survive less than 12 months irrespective of the treatment modality .    3.0342555909169975
for diffuse pleural mesothelioma , some favorable prognostic factors were identified : imig ( international mesothelioma interest group ) , stages i and ii , epithelial type , age under 50 , female gender .    1.984250761358418
in imig stages i and ii , extended UNK followed by chemo - and / or radiotherapy is recommended .    2.652846076609889
for this UNK of patients , a median survival time of between 20 and 30 months is reported .    2.9604823135289657
UNK and UNK are recommended as palliative surgical strategies against pleural effusion .    2.7434137519118544
in patients with technically inoperable infiltration of the thoracic wall , irradiation is helpful ; sometimes partial remission and relief of pain can be achieved by chemotherapy .    2.4527140978404054
in contrast to the fetal UNK , UNK permits non - invasive registration of fetal heart activity and documentation of all parts of the UNK - wave - forms from the second UNK onwards .    2.8967069113509822
we examined 53 women in 104 recordings from the 10th week of gestation onwards ( 1 to 10 recordings per individual ) .    1.9900817021042767
the fmcg ( 37 magnetic channels , sampling rate UNK hz , UNK 1 - UNK ) was recorded non - invasively over the mother ' s abdomen in a UNK shielded room .    2.3702048363648265
in a few cases , fetal heart beats could be registered as early as in the UNK week .    2.9460501117132893
cardiac time intervals and amplitudes of fmcg increased UNK with fetal growth .    2.144318037990193
mean p wave duration increased from 31 to 49 ms ( p < 0 . 05 ) , UNK interval from 95 to 107 ms ( n . s . ) and qrs duration from 36 to 52 ms ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.0134882388087183
the mean amplitudes of the p and r waves also increased .    2.2612325037267746
to demonstrate imaging findings in inflammatory diseases of the pharynx and possible complications .    2.8477767917882146
the purpose of this retrospective study was to analyse the complications of our arthroscopic procedures at the ankle joint .    2.6247914678899145
in all patients we evaluated the treatment protocols and in 111 patients ( 79 , 3 % ) we also evaluated the clinical and radiologic results .    2.6414295982129112
all in all we have found complications in 14 patients .    2.407088667147801
in 4 cases we have seen a delayed wound healing , in 2 cases a superficial infection , in 3 cases a deep infection , in 3 cases a neural damage and in 2 cases a UNK .    2.5014996019272515
our study show , that the complication rate could be minimized by detailed knowledge of the anatomy , exact preoperative diagnostic and planing of the operation and careful preparation of the UNK .    2.806213782985544
the use of a laser also shows a tendency to a lower complication rate .    2.610588347674549
airbag inflation is associated with a loud noise .    3.032980364595808
this very short noise has a peak amplitude of 170 db sound pressure level and can make UNK injuries .    2.0068747051864966
we report a case of acoustic trauma after airbag inflation .    2.2671115671548816
the 24 - year - old man has hearing loss both side in the 3000 - to UNK - hz range and in the deep - frequency .    2.508794516314898
the incidence of primary malignant neoplasms of the pleura , the pericardium and the peritoneum in germany has been rising since about the mid - 1980 s . a continuing rise is expected until about UNK , predominantly due to the peak of asbestos processing in germany between 1965 and 1980 .    2.0563465362317395
about 90 % of the mesotheliomas stored in the files of the german mesothelioma registry in bochum are asbestos related and therefore possibly due to occupational exposure that may be compensated by the professional associations .    2.3504780390917053
more than 500 mesotheliomas annually can be diagnosed in the german mesothelioma registry .    2.910799609866148
in this first part of the series on mesotheliomas , current concepts on etiology and pathogenesis as well as diagnostic procedures and standards are discussed .    2.8306302549344053
at the present , specific chromosomal or genetic defects that constantly give rise to a mesothelioma are not known .    2.1864071007870676
the initiation and progression of malignant mesotheliomas is a highly complex mechanism that is based on individual genetic alterations .    2.3584863398873974
a reliable diagnosis is the basis for therapeutic , prognostic and medicolegal UNK ; in general , it can be achieved by thoracoscopic inspection with selected biopsy .    2.7552809356936896
surgery may gain a more important role in the therapy of malignant tumors of UNK membranes not only in palliative , but also in potential curative approaches if the diagnosis can be made at earlier tumor stages .    2.7045034948310596
acute gastrointestinal bleeding is a life threatening disease with a mortality rate of 10 % .    2.9488510186136447
upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs more frequent ( 85 % ) and more severe compared to lower gastrointestinal bleeding .    2.6498521014590266
the medical history may be helpful in the diagnosis of the bleeding source .    3.4566958564816175
furthermore rebleeding is associated with an increased mortality .    3.1313969345775527
therefore one major goal in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding is to avoid rebleeding .    2.8354745352524025
this activation causes pain in conscious humans .    2.334775452791424
the sensory UNK of many nociceptors in the tissue are sensitized by inflammatory processes .    2.3054452931686713
under these conditions , normally UNK and non - painful stimuli are sufficient to activate nociceptors and to elicit pain .    2.167553699434588
in addition to their sensory function , many nociceptors have an efferent function .    2.1424291541308165
they UNK a neurogenic inflammation by the release of neuropeptides such as substance p and calcitonin gene - related peptide into the tissue .    2.03255885517414
the efferent function of nociceptors contributes to the generation of inflammatory lesions of the tissue .    2.7224226048792737
autolyzed , antigen - extracted , allogeneic bone ( aaa bone ) is prepared from cortical bones of human organ donors .    1.9017800037179355
within a prospective study , 37 cranial defects were reconstructed using aaa bone implants over a period of more than 7 years .    2.7102235374399735
the patients were followed - up at standardized intervals .    2.6954246660683454
roentgenographic assessments and bone UNK revealed osseous integration and remodelling of the aaa bone implants .    2.280080392543551
in one quarter of the cases re - entry was performed 10 to 18 months after the cranioplasty ( removal of osteosynthesis material , recurrence of tumor ) .    2.3192900042085496
all nine aaa bone reconstructions showed bleeding surfaces and bony UNK .    2.141863804106438
a bone biopsy was taken from the center of one of these aaa bone implants and this showed new bone formation originating from the surface of the implant .    2.7557269716913053
in one case an aaa bone implant was lost due to infection .    2.1974433570506386
this is noteworthy as in approximately one third of the cases the bone implants were in direct contact with the frontal sinus .    2.7442242364428693
large aaa bone chips from human skull bones facilitate the reconstruction of the skull ' s UNK , especially when UNK - based operation planning is performed .    2.523324615270066
saphenous vein harvesting remains a 20 % source of morbidity in patients who require lower extremity bypass or coronary artery bypass grafting .    2.2956156917887602
in an attempt to reduce the complications associated with this procedure , minimally invasive video - assisted vein harvesting is UNK .    2.7214442563172843
the technique uses currently available endoscopic equipment with mechanical retraction to dissect the great saphenous vein with two limited incisions .    1.9294586748277816
the dissection is visualized on the video monitor to isolate and control side branches by clips .    1.962817066836304
the vein is removed for reverse arterial bypass grafting or dissection is completed for an in situ bypass procedure .    2.1408130751629275
initial experience with ten patients undergoing peripheral bypass procedures showed a mean vein - preparation time of 60 min .    2.110840855266986
two of seven in situ bypass procedures were complicated by side branch damage controlled through longer skin incision .    1.980258753563694
after a mean follow - up of 12 months , all bypasses are patent .    2.9193798901850245
taking our own experience as well as that reported in the literature into consideration , aspects of cost - effectiveness are discussed .    2.963839986487199
the reason is an incomplete UNK and differentiation of the lacrimal duct during the fetal period .    2.4898405424550196
a persisting membran between the duct and the nasal cavity at the level of the valve of UNK in combination with a proximal UNK obstruction at the junction of the lacrimal canal and sac may cause a dacryocystocele by fluid accumulation .    2.2524780600813212
we describe a term newborn with a bilateral dacryocystocele and respiratory distress .    2.1644694668940563
the recognition of a medical discipline on a european level as an independent specialty depends on its registration in the medical directives of the european union .    2.2378986665357976
with supreme effort , the oral and maxillofacial surgeons of the eu reached this goal in 1989 .    2.239153807042382
the UNK - section of UNK and UNK surgery - became the UNK for discussion of the relevant problems with representatives of the member states and UNK of the european commission .    3.2474362254439284
thanks to its activities , oral and maxillofacial surgery is now recognized as an independent specialty with about 3800 specialists in 11 european countries .    2.1094032697717586
a biatrial pacemaker was inserted in a 68 - year - old female with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter refractory to antiarrhythmic drugs based on a sick - sinus - syndrome and concomitant interatrial conduction delay .    2.2280365571319813
the pacemaker was programmed in ddd - mode with an av - delay of 30 ms .    2.2691099937786583
under a chronic antiarrhythmic medication with 160 mg sotalol per day there was no evidence for recurrent episodes of atrial tachyarrhythmias in the patient ' s history , 24 - h - holter - ecg , nor in the memory of the pacemaker during a follow - up of 8 months .    2.4383156260210392
the ab0 blood types , first discovered by karl UNK in UNK , can be UNK with the pcr method of lee and chang [ 6 ] .    2.59421305048146
using two UNK pairs , allele - specific sequences can be amplified and , after digestion with restriction UNK , visualized by silver staining on a UNK gel .    1.9349070803942372
in a UNK german population the allele frequencies were : allele a = 0 . UNK , allele b = 0 . UNK and allele 0 = 0 . UNK .    2.7532055577172097
with the method of lee and chang [ 6 ] only the nucleotide positions 261 and UNK are considered so that out of 280 individuals 10 ( 3 . 57 % ) showed differences between the ab0 genotype and phenotype , because it was not possible to differentiate between a and 02 alleles .    2.415977403574824
based on the one experience and the information that is available in the literature indications for ankle arthroscopy are given , surgical equipment , patient placement and surgical technique of different procedures are described .    2.503347905212305
finally the results and possible complications are presented .    2.940631664328399
removal of loose bodies as well as UNK in case of an acute infection or rheumatoid arthritis are good indication .    3.083044672094971
arthroscopic treatment of anterior pathology in the athletic ankle need a thorough diagnostic work - up ; the results of the treatment do not always meet the expectations of this especially demanding population .    2.4573856319624428
cartilage treatment is technically possible , however , long term results are still missing .    3.1167182532830795
this is also true for the treatment on osteochondritis dissecans .    2.8886798156508635
in patients with degenerative joint disease arthroscopic debridement can only lead to a temporary benefit .    2.58657265736156
arthroscopic assisted arthrodeses ( aaa ) is technically demanding , but can serve as an excellent alternative to conventional open techniques .    2.4886638602997855
the complication rate in ankle arthroscopy is high compared to other joints , which is especially true for neurologic complications and postoperative infections .    2.3780927384667225
this should be addressed when performing the informed consent .    2.22354700126511
recent prospective randomised trials UNK with the optimal extent of surgical resection as well as with preoperative therapy modalities in pancreatic , rectal and breast cancer .    2.455193942329319
in pancreatic cancer extended lymphadenectomy did not improve overall survival .    2.410257268456191
total UNK excision remarkably changed surgery for rectal cancer .    2.331141882330929
rate of local recurrence of rectal cancer could be significantly reduced by preoperative irradiation .    2.5601234680620726
in advanced rectal cancers curative resection and sphincter preservation seems possible due to multimodal preoperative therapy .    1.9578648566541448
it has been demonstrated that in appropriate cases UNK resection is comparable to mastectomy with respect to overall survival .    2.6268543082669362
up to now it is not quite clear if sentinel node sampling is equivalent to routine lymphadenectomy .    2.297489445084398
following neoadjuvant chemotherapy UNK rate is significantly higher , but survival is not significantly increased .    2.331621614794178
introduction and methods : a 0 . 5 t open - configuration mr system allows free access to the patient via a 58 - cm - wide opening on both sides of the machine .    2.6310848304577488
a newly developed system for needle guidance enables the examiner to perform biopsies in combination with real - time imaging and to position laser fibers in the human body .    2.2812443277762013
for imaging , a 2d gradient echo sequence is used ( tr 19 ms , te 9 ms , UNK angle 30 ° , UNK 24 x 24 cm , slice thickness 10 mm matrix 256 x 128 ) .    1.7669960026092038
the acquired images are displayed on two UNK screens localized within the mr system , thus allowing an interactive needle guidance .    2.0636843619120215
angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ace ) inhibitors are established drugs for the treatment of patients with heart failure and hypertension .    2.713586237886423
there is UNK evidence to suggest that ace inhibitors may be used for different indications as well .    2.5747269584460404
the rational for the use of ace inhibitors is to block the UNK effects mediated by angiotensin ii .    2.6025528903353243
the hemodynamic profile of ace inhibitors is modified by additional effects such as interference with the UNK of bradykinin and accumulation of prostaglandin and nitric oxide ( no ) .    2.373998180178011
thus ace inhibitors may be successful in preventing the negative effects of vasoconstriction on regional circulation .    2.2258138969439494
since vasoconstriction , particularly of the mesenteric vasculature appears to be largely mediated by the renin - angiotensin - axis , ace inhibitors are assumed to be effective in treating or avoiding gut mucosal hypoperfusion .    2.1303033892630387
the critically ill intensive care patient at risk of developing multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) is still a major therapeutic challenge .    2.5740427864750863
intravenous preparations of ace inhibitors may broaden our therapeutic armamentarium for these patients .    2.3648166637731065
however , several questions about the exact mechanisms of ace inhibitors , such as the ideal substance and the optimal dose , are still open .    2.6256570549413887
the pharmacologic properties of ace inhibitors provide an UNK UNK stone for future research in this field .    2.472431213229019
hypoparathyroidism ( hp ) results from deficient parathyroid hormone ( pth ) secretion , UNK ( UNK ) results form decreased pth action on its target organs .    2.1894147184801533
between may 1996 and 1999 , a total of 186 endoscopic spinal operations were performed to treat unstable injuries and pathologic fractures .    2.4849233177383385
the operative spinal interventions followed the classic sequence of excision of part of a vertebral body , partial replacement of the vertebral body with bone harvested from the iliac crest , and implantation of a titanium plate to stabilize the part to be fused .    2.225649711486548
in 62 % of these cases we performed primary dorsal straightening with a fixateur UNK .    2.7176946472343766
the serious complications were aortic leakage and deep infection in the area of the graft and the implant , each of which occurred in 1 case .    2.652766299450368
comparisons with the literature showed approximately the same rate of spinal complications as with open surgery , while the rate of morbidity connected with the surgical approach was reduced to a third in the patient population treated endoscopically , with correspondingly positive implications for the postoperative analgesic requirement and for convalescence .    2.5635377103483536
various risk scores have been developed for the assessment of operative risk in cardiac surgery .    2.9660499862926892
although risk stratification has been acknowledged as a useful tool to analyze trends in therapy and changes in patient populations , its relevance in assessing the indication for surgery has been questioned .    2.4548589237433656
it was the goal of this prospective study to compare 6 common risk scores with regard to the predictive value for mortality in individual patients .    2.616234440721033
between september 1998 and february 1999 all adult patients undergoing heart surgery were prospectively scored according to the following scores : initial UNK , UNK clinic , french , euro , pons , and the ontario province risk score .    2.436795766341855
early lethality was assessed within 30 days postoperatively .    2.379659535955149
follow - up was completed in UNK patients .    2.9014660207935896
with the exception of the ontario province risk score , lethality in the high risk group was overestimated by all scores , whereas lethality in low to moderate risk groups was underestimated by several scores .    2.0365782905011147
mean scores of surviving and deceased patients showed a broad overlap with high standard deviations .    2.3212750151844066
preoperative risk scores are effective tools for stratification of patient populations and the analysis of surgical outcome .    2.3746550341661603
with the aid of risk scores , operative risk can be sufficiently predicted for patient populations or subpopulations .    2.330608327202337
the euro score best predicted the outcome of our patients .    2.8495192155244253
however , when the indication for surgery is to be determined in an individual patient , risk scores should be only considered as an orientation in the decision process .    2.791888688731282
bullous , haemorrhagic , necrotic and purulent lesions may be encountered .    2.179236826823653
today no reliable data exist as to which constitutional factors renders a patient at risk for developing complicated erysipelas though several risk factors , particularly diabetes mellitus , are often suggested .    2.1506613038849163
based on the analysis of patients with erysipelas at the department of dermatology in UNK , factors determining the risk for complicated erysipelas should be identified .    3.115736952078656
patients / methods : in a retrospective case - control study clinical data UNK of UNK in - patients treated at the department were evaluated with respect to the course of the erysipelas and with respect to potential risk factors .    3.2663989980352173
results : general risk factors for local complications were location at the lower extremities , pre - existing hepatic or renal disease , hyperuricaemia , and diabetes mellitus .    2.3723502740448414
hepatic and renal disease and - to a lesser extent - diabetes particularly predisposed for bullous and haemorrhagic lesions , while vascular occlusive disease enhanced the risk for UNK - UNK lesions .    2.3744726236688667
conclusions : location and hepatic and renal disease are the most important risk factors , while diabetes is probably of less significance than previously suggested .    2.4777378022786265
patients with end - stage liver disease frequently develop combined coagulopathies due to increased procoagulant and fibrinolytic turnover as well as thrombocytopenia .    2.4446108849158947
the onset of clinical symptoms of a haemorrhagic diathesis requires balanced substitution of coagulation factors , since fresh frozen plasma alone does not always maintain a sufficient haemostatic potential in these patients .    2.185224714867827
this substitution commonly follows standard rules based on the assumption that 0 . 5 - 1 iu of a coagulation factor or inhibitor concentrate given per kg body weight will increase its endogenous activity by 1 % .    2.284325455482182
we set out to investigate the validity of this standard regime in patients with end - stage liver disease scheduled for orthotopic liver transplantation .    2.6646218454365695
fifty - one adult patients were prospectively studied .    2.588063287413838
twenty - seven of the patients had chronic hepatic failure ( chf group ) with histologically proven cirrhosis and 10 had acute hepatic failure ( UNK group ) .    2.3453294790936745
blood samples were drawn prior to a 15 - min infusion of at iii concentrate and 30 min thereafter .    2.3707568542338437
in 14 patients with prothrombin time ( pt ) < 40 % , at iii levels had been corrected earlier during the clinical course to achieve activities > 70 % .    2.210954286638906
prothrombin complex ( ppsb , UNK , behring , marburg , germany ) was substituted ( mean dose UNK + / - 289 iu ) to increase procoagulant activity to pt > 60 % .    2.299832326177791
blood samples were drawn in the same fashion as in the at iii group .    2.733551306562549
the amounts of at iii and ppsb concentrates ( at iii , [ iu / kg ] ; ppsb [ iu / kg ] ) required to increase at iii activity and pt , respectively , by 1 % were calculated .    2.1857008271018925
standard calculations for at iii substitution indicated at iii recovery in all 37 patients who received at iii concentrate .    2.2482822280667296
however , there was a statistically significant difference between patients with clf and alf .    2.915357981719726
in patients with clf , at iii was found to be 0 . 8 iu / kg ( + / - 0 . 1 sem ) and in those with alf it was 1 . 5 iu / kg ( + / - 0 . 1 sem ) ( p < 0 . 05 , t - test ) .    2.9555167091602947
in patients treated with ppsb concentrate , ppsb was 1 . 6 u / kg ( + / - 0 . 2 sem ) for both clf and alf groups .    2.596262241132815
in patients with end stage liver disease standard rules for substitution with at iii - concentrate are adequate only for patients with clf .    2.4770886648122965
in patients with alf higher at iii doses are required to achieve the expected effect on endogenous at iii activity .    2.327058676834624
procoagulant activity , as reflected by pt , can be increased by 1 % when 1 . 6 iu / kg ppsb concentrate is given .    2.481632082502217
however , this study shows the effects of coagulation concentrates only 30 min after administration .    2.9158412810704593
an increased volume of distribution and increased turnover may explain the poor recovery of at iii activity in the alf group , indicating that the dose of coagulation concentrate should be estimated against the background of the patient ' s clinical symptoms and diagnosis .    2.485296951789452
fatigue is a common symptom in patients with multiple sclerosis .    3.9014367262494845
rapid exhaustion and reduced exercise tolerance leads to difficulties in maintaining a normal daily life for many patients .    1.9631806799147815
regular resting and short breaks can help to compensate this to a certain degree .    2.391981181071554
a sixteen year old girl with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis suffered two episodes of toxic shock syndrome within a short period of time .    2.4134112315598997
both occasions were associated with menstruation .    2.8112463203139133
UNK UNK was isolated in the tracheal secretions once .    2.740714350530498
discussion : the etiology of the toxic shock syndrome has been extensively described .    2.6772696426319884
the toxic shock syndrome toxin - 1 acts as a UNK in toxic shock syndrome and interestingly a similar mechanism is discussed in juvenile rheumatoid arthritis .    2.479420126115887
this case report demonstrates the possibility of a close relationship between toxic shock syndrome and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and raises the suspicion of a similar UNK process .    2.5505340391099725
UNK of mibelli is a rare inherited disorder of epidermal keratinization , whose pathogenesis is not fully understood .    2.4100973314380787
the common clinical feature is a erythematous plaque surrounded by a hyperkeratotic border .    2.2104044527888367
the histopathologic hallmark is a UNK UNK UNK .    3.6755938870878024
an unusual case of porokeratosis UNK , a morphological variant of classical porokeratosis of mibelli , is reported .    2.289136566971367
the pathogenesis , taking in account especially the clonal hypothesis and premalignant nature of porokeratosis , is discussed .    1.9874304063065906
with the introduction of the non - benzodiazepine hypnotics zopiclone and zolpidem it was expected to have hypnotics without side effects and risks characteristically seen with benzodiazepines .    2.5428648348478724
both patients were prescribed the drugs to treat sleep disturbances occuring during a depressive episode .    2.1104566855184776
while one patient had a UNK abuse there was no evidence for an abuse history in the other patient .    2.9112044017896515
to reduce withdrawal symptoms long - acting benzodiazepines were given to both patients .    2.246259483814296
thus , it seems that not only patients with a history of substance abuse but also patients with a psychiatric disorder are at risk for abuse of non - benzodiazepine hypnotics .    3.104334095884624
considering the increasing number of case reports with abuse and dependence of zopiclone and zolpidem it seems necessary to reevaluate the dependency risk of the currently available non - benzodiazepine hypnotics .    2.1292052541691633
fractures of the proximal radius in children may lead to deformities of the radial head and functional disturbance of pro - and supination .    2.8641524928469373
however , traumatization is not only caused by the injury itself , but may also occur secondary to surgical reduction , manipulation of fracture fragments and excessive physiotherapy .    2.3614731438597394
in a prospective long - term follow - study ( 2 - 20 years after trauma ) of 38 children with displaced proximal radius fractures we found functional disturbances in 11 % of children only .    2.362764472142796
these were not caused by radial head deformities , which were present on 83 % of follow - up radiographs .    2.7587119080663034
functional impairment was mainly seen after open reduction or secondary growth disturbances .    2.366668390612361
on follow - up radiographs all conservatively treated fracture UNK up to 60 ° had corrected themselves spontaneously .    2.4288395048945426
in view of the high complication rates after open reduction and the poor functional results , as well as the UNK for the pediatric patient and the economic aspects , we recommend a primary conservative treatment concept of proximal radius fractures in children .    2.9736415845563986
patients who have undergone cardiac surgery with use of extracorporeal circulation frequently reveal marked UNK in spite of a highly positive fluid balance .    2.3804539192524117
this is thought to be due to transient microvascular damage and extravascular fluid shift .    2.578037171430165
further volume replacement to achieve haemodynamic stability in the postoperative period may cause fluid overload and congestive heart failure .    2.1783255975662534
purpose : the temporomandibular joint is a place of motion where release of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) induces cartilage destruction via production of nitric oxide ( no ) .    2.1138492568354033
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of continuous passive motion in the form of cyclic stretch on the synthesis of inducible nitric oxide synthase ( inos ) .    2.2727269478674637
subsequently , cells ( 105 / ml per well ) were transferred to UNK plates , grown to 90 % UNK , and subjected to one of the following regimens : ( 1 ) no mechanical strain ( 10 hz , 20 % elongation rate ) ; ( 2 ) rhil - 1 ( 1 ng / ml ) ; ( 3 ) mechanical strain ; ( 4 ) mechanical strain and rhil - 1 .    2.668786411069038
the cells were exposed to cyclic stretch for 24 h . thereafter , cells were UNK and UNK on microscope slides in a UNK UNK .    2.7736095183967686
the presence of inos was determined by indirect UNK staining using polyclonal rabbit anti - inos as primary antibodies , and UNK anti - rabbit igg conjugated with UNK peroxidase ( hrp ) as secondary antibodies .    2.1076845547855405
UNK was used as substrate for hrp .    2.829543597118162
total no production was UNK measured in the supernatants of cultures using UNK reaction .    2.1679158137316565
all experiments were done in UNK and the statistical significance was analyzed by student ' s t - test .    2.8414858543992167
results : cells with treatment 1 and 3 did not exhibit presence of inos .    2.3539888450536712
il - 1 - treated cells in group 2 exhibited intense peroxidase staining .    3.062058728241354
cells in group 4 exposed to il - 1 and mechanical stress showed staining with considerably less intensity .    2.3020229752484225
control cells treated with normal rabbit igg as a primary antibody did not exhibit peroxidase staining .    2.3639998803598163
the data were further confirmed by measurement of statistically significant differences of no levels in supernatants assessed in the four different treatment groups .    2.1861403304692852
conclusion : our findings suggest that continuous passive motion exerts anti - inflammatory effects on chondrocytes , UNK the quantity of inos - positive cells .    2.26640334085632
since no acts as an intracellular , UNK , and cytotoxic molecule , it has a basic importance for proper post - traumatic and postoperative tmj function as well as the course and therapy of inflammatory tmj diseases .    2.8485367910272372
recently , we presented an implantable piezoelectrical hearing aid transducer .    2.230982183301339
its characteristics make it suitable for implantation in patients with sensorineural hearing loss .    2.843786146748574
the transducer UNK micromechanical vibrations instead of sound into the hearing organ .    2.132772906285388
efficiency of the transducer implant was investigated in ten cat ears .    2.825598581708743
after determining preoperative ( acoustical ) bera threshold , the middle ear was opened and the piezoelectrical transducer coupled to various ossicles or the perilymph .    2.017506215522585
bera responses were recorded following stimulation of umbo , long incus process , stapes head , stapes foot plate , and UNK .    2.1003258135418643
by comparing the acoustical and mechanical threshold , a correlation was found between the stimulus level of acoustical and mechanical stimulation .    2.3020009797133527
an electrical transducer voltage of 1 UNK * was equivalent to sound - pressure levels between 100 and 128 db spl at the tympanic membrane .    1.934889300610825
to judge hearing impression , stimulus - dependent latencies of the early acoustically and mechanically evoked potentials ( waves p1 to UNK ) and their thresholds were analyzed .    2.408931357422807
after coupling the piezoelectrical transducer to the long incus process , latencies corresponded well to stimulation .    2.242598953580417
they were almost completely similar when the equivalent sound - pressure level of 100 db spl was achieved by the transducer voltage level .    2.1973637217316115
pyoderma gangrenosum was first described in 1930 by UNK , UNK and o ' UNK .    3.0803206046483727
nevertheless we found some illustrations in an atlas on dermatology , published by marie - UNK devergie in the first half of the UNK century , which appear to be pyoderma gangrenosum .    2.4643407079811355
devergie interpreted those enlarging ulcers as a side effect of mercury therapy .    2.320039971249413
thus we were able to find evidence of pyoderma gangrenosum more than 100 years before first description in 1930 .    2.316963887677296
the etiology of this clinical picture is still unsettled .    2.7075677636744477
the favorite postulate has been a bacterial genesis which was the subject of numerous publications until the 1960s .    2.361470174584205
multiple - system atrophy ( msa ) is characterized by progressive autonomic failure with cerebellar , pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs .    2.1172275494113113
in msa patients laryngoscopy often reveals unilateral or bilateral abductor vocal fold palsies .    2.102845896259134
however , assessment of sites of obstruction and their severity is needed .    2.1965699511882226
we report our clinical experience in managing a 56 - year - old , obese male msa patient ( 1 . 76 m height , 100 kg weight , bmi 32 . 3 kg / m2 ) who was admitted for evaluation of snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness .    2.2453269458051492
endoscopy while awake demonstrated an incomplete abductor vocal fold palsy .    2.2345545330516043
polysomnography confirmed heavy snoring with arousals ( 11 . 1 / h ) and an UNK of 1 . 4 / h .    3.0925309525430165
sleep efficiency was low ( 51 . 9 % ) due to long intermittent awake periods .    2.5245626726180235
sleep videoendoscopy of the upper airway proved the entire pharynx to be open during rem and non - rem sleep .    2.370060289518517
during inspiration UNK movements of the vocal cords caused the snoring .    2.4762174962432786
this was regularly terminated by arousals .    2.4467864564573842
in general , glottic snoring without daytime UNK is rare and has only been described in msa patients .    2.408108966558884
however , certain of these patients will also be pharyngeal UNK .    2.8130494170023574
the source of the sound and site of obstruction can only be diagnosed by sleep videoendoscopy .    2.6338394799497227
introduction : homografts for valve replacement are indicated in acute valve endocarditis .    2.3144869586047885
it is assumed that they possess anti - infective properties .    2.182330220156127
homografts are an established indication in aortic valve replacement .    2.574368007351849
we present our early results with homografts for mitral valve replacement in acute endocarditis .    2.2672237821141343
the surgical management of enlarged inferior UNK has been actively debated for more than a century .    2.3809980325344196
the second part of this review UNK the following techniques : UNK , submucous turbinectomy , UNK - UNK , partial turbinectomy , anterior turbinectomy , inferior UNK , total turbinectomy , and vidian neurectomy .    2.406261487669182
indications , advantages , disadvantages , complications , and controversies of each treatment UNK are reviewed and discussed .    2.2800028269934387
partial or submucosal resection should be prefered , because there are moderate side effects and the amount of UNK excised can be altered according the degree of symptomatology .    2.5001148999402507
total turbinectomy or vidian neurectomy are indicated if all other treatment attemps do not succeed .    2.0585665997520195
acute oxalosis is an important disorder causing serious abnormalities .    2.7430494850042764
acute oxalosis may come about by ethylene glycol poisoning ; in recent years iatrogenic cases of acute oxalosis have also been described following iv treatments of UNK , a vasodilator .    2.553835450578138
furthermore , chronic asymptomatic intestinal oxalosis may turn symptomatic by a superimposed major load of oxalate .    1.967772506646779
acute oxalosis results in acute renal failure ; in addition oxalate - induced angiopathy may be associated with necrosis of affected tissue .    2.3324065404842846
the diagnosis of acute oxalosis requires a demonstration of oxalate crystals in the urine and in other affected tissues .    2.2799132263219435
in terms of therapy , hemodialysis should be used promptly in cases of ethylene glycol poisoning and a worsening of the renal function .    2.8008948821472366
in cases of a secondary chronic intestinal oxalosis prophylactic measures such as maintaining an elevated urinary flow rate and prescribing oral calcium supplements will be helpful .    2.074944567765152
generalized granuloma annulare is a rare variant of granuloma annulare affecting the trunk and extremities with a multitude of lesions .    2.5490190741053067
in contrast to localized granuloma annulare , generalized granuloma annulare occurs in older patients , shows a stronger association with diabetes , and is characteristically chronic .    2.284971192612279
like our 55 - year - old patient , most patients present with papules and annular plaques ; less often , macular or non - annular lesions may be encountered .    2.2577696139292223
histology often fails to show necrobiotic or necrotic connective tissue changes demarcated by a UNK granuloma .    2.213770716508815
instead , there are diffuse dermal , band - like or nodular aggregations of histiocytes intermingled with some multinucleated giant cells and a predominantly lymphocytic infiltrate in the periphery .    1.9721656559875507
because of its special characteristics , it has been suggested that generalized granuloma annulare might constitute a separate disease entity and that it should be classed among the primary cutaneous histiocytoses as a diffuse dermal histiocytosis .    2.320970451229463
using immunohistochemistry to determine the UNK phenotype of the lesional histiocytes , we have shown that generalized granuloma annulare is not a cutaneous histiocytosis .    2.863567437160144
neither ms - 1 high - molecular - weight protein , a new specific marker for cutaneous non - langerhans cell histiocytoses , nor UNK , the well - known marker for langerhans cells and langerhans cell histiocytoses , is expressed by the lesional histiocytes of our patient .    2.1404732915779245
in contrast , the antigen expression pattern was diagnostic for non - infectious granulomas and was highly similar to that in localized granuloma annulare .    2.234982080685688
in contrast to the successful treatment of localized granuloma annulare reported with intralesional interferon - 1 , systemic treatment with interferon - 2b ( UNK units three times a week ) was ineffective .    2.344131815960797
the aims of the study were : ( 1 ) to predict reversal time from intensive atracurium blockade ; and ( 2 ) to determine the optimal time of neostigmine administration during recovery from atracurium blockade , i . e . , the time at which the administration of neostigmine results in the shortest total recovery time ( time from administration of last supplemental dose of atracurium to train - of - four [ tof ] ratio 0 . 70 ) , and at the same time results in the shortest time from administration of neostigmine to tof ratio 0 . 70 .    2.4816657177023598
the spontaneous and neostigmine - facilitated recovery in 52 healthy women anaesthetised with thiopentone , fentanyl , droperidol , and nitrous oxide was followed .    1.9696178914317475
post - UNK count ( ptc ) of tof stimulation of the ulnar nerve and UNK were used for monitoring neuromuscular transmission .    2.7040788740440513
the neuromuscular blockade was induced with atracurium 0 . 6 mg / kg and supplemental doses of 0 . 15 mg / kg were given when the first twitch response in the tof ( th1 ) had recovered to 20 % .    2.4614070467825266
neostigmine 0 . 036 mg / kg body weight was given at different levels of neuromuscular blockade to 37 of the patients .    2.5759829048710987
multiple regression analyses including pre - reversal time ( time from administration of the last atracurium dose to neostigmine administration ) , ptc , weight , and age of the patients suggest that pre - reversal time is the best predictor of reversal time : reversal time = 27 . 3 min - ( 0 . 89xpre - reversal time [ min ] ; ( see = 6 . 0 min ) .    2.281081806453947
if pre - reversal time is unknown , ptc can be used : reversal time = 24 min - ( 4 . UNK ptc ) at time of reversal ) ; ( see = 6 . 8 min ) .    2.4865641900101614
total recovery time was 47 min ( sem = 2 . 0 min , n = 15 ) in the patients allowed to recover spontaneously , and 29 min ( sem = 1 . 2 min , n = 29 ) in the patients reversed by neostigmine ; the difference of 18 min ( se UNK 2 . 0 min ) was significant ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    2.7988551896441667
the level of blockade indicated by ptc ( 1 - 24 ) at the time of reversal had no influence on the total recovery time .    2.932536272515357
the spontaneous recovery times from UNK of th1 and th1 = 10 % to tof ratio 0 . 70 were 29 . 2 min ( sem = 1 . 7 min ) and 24 . 4 min ( sem = 2 . 6 min ) , respectively .    2.3790625327239416
the results suggest that pre - reversal time is the strongest predictor of reversal time when neostigmine is administered during intense atracurium blockade .    2.0613449085268725
to achieve the optimal time - saving effect , neostigmine must be given 18 min ( the time saved by giving neostigmine ) plus 7 to 11 min ( needed for neostigmine to reach its peak effect ) , giving a total of 25 to 29 min before tof ratio 0 . 70 .    2.0516282437119044
as th1 is between 1 % and 10 % 25 to 29 min before tof ratio 0 . 70 is reached during spontaneous recovery , the optimal level of neuromuscular blockade for neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade is when th1 is between 1 % and 10 % .    1.9324286997182092
reversal time can be predicted as 27 . 3 min - ( 0 . 89xpre - reversal time ( min ) , and the optimal time of neostigmine administration in atracurium blockade appears to be when th1 is 1 % - 10 % .    2.721348090817882
a seminar for hospital physicians in management positions ( UNK UNK - und UNK , UNK ) in october 1994 illustrated the immediate relevance of w . r . bion ' s book experiences in groups and other papers , published in 1961 .    2.3096340262815738
the aim of this article , UNK bion ' s experiences in groups by presenting in seminar ' s leadership principles , is to show how these experiences can be applied to an understanding of the individual .    2.37955881136261
if continuous seizure activity lasts longer than 5 minutes generalized tonic - clonic seizures require prompt treatment , if significant morbidity and mortality are to be avoided .    2.1342916542434933
the mortality varies ( mean : 20 % ) depending on patient age and etiology .    2.4534732387891602
control of status epilepticus is achieved by benzodiazepines in about 80 % of cases : UNK is recommended due to its longer - acting effects on the central nervous system .    2.718475180513849
to maintain the UNK effect phenytoin is usually administered intravenously .    2.565057998614732
UNK ( not approved in germany ) has advantages over phenytoin , because it can be given three times more rapidly and produces fewer side effects .    2.2903395463842395
the iv use of UNK acid in status epilepticus seems to be promising , but needs further evaluation .    2.5638208604564117
there is no generally accepted treatment protocol for the therapy of persistent seizure activity lasting more than 60 minutes ( i . e . , refractory status epilepticus ) .    2.3095424542557303
usually UNK , or general anesthesia with thiopental or UNK are treatment recommendations .    2.6080634883978675
in recent reports , the administration of midazolam or propofol proved to be effective and well - tolerated .    2.969203009270352
since the life span of our society is increasing and the expectation of high functional demands is growing more and more older people take part in sports activities UNK the necessity of early diagnosis of rotator cuff lesions and their correct treatment .    2.137142662727975
the goal of any diagnostic means should be a proper treatment of rotator cuff lesions according to the detected pathology .    2.4424450819025045
new arthroscopic techniques to surgically reconstruct rotator cuff tears have brought the operative repair techniques another step further .    2.0455062777912274
in cases of large and complex cuff tears the surgeon can individually select an adequate reconstruction procedure which includes anatomical - , partial - , tendon - transfer and muscle - transfer repairs .    1.8978440106979544
in cases of UNK tears with cuff - tear arthropathy and consecutive superior migration of the humeral head hemiarthroplasty or the inverse deltoid prosthesis have to be considered .    2.041787787718546
based on clinical , radiological and arthroscopic findings we developed algorithms that will lead to the best suited procedure for a given lesion .    2.54150383285868
almost all patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( als ) experience symptoms of nocturnal hypoventilation during the course of the illness .    2.3363630637746824
non - invasive intermittent home mechanical ventilation ( hmv ) via mask is a possible palliative measure for these symptoms , which is not often used in germany .    2.523631133705761
we report on our experience with hmv in 24 patients with als .    2.6577255629120726
our data show a good palliative effect in 17 of 24 treated patients .    2.377182391159844
severe complications did not occur .    2.6513918449144094
the mean ventilation time at present is 14 months .    2.3387722172709173
available options and their consequences need to be discussed in detail with patients and relatives before hmv is initiated .    2.527728499641176
many clinical studies have been performed investigating corneal endothelial cell loss after penetrating keratoplasty using different preservation methods .    2.3954512071288923
the aim of this study was to perform endothelial cell evaluation 5 years after penetrating keratoplasty using two different storage methods .    2.0943478285180963
primary sclerosing UNK ( psc ) is generally associated with ulcerative colitis ( uc ) .    2.1948735522911496
the disease typically progresses slowly , but ultimately , and leads to cirrhosis , liver failure or bile duct cancer .    2.070013328822267
psc patients with simultanous ulcerative colitis are also at higher risk for colorectal cancer .    2.1782292783754644
at the present time , there is no effective treatment for psc , although preliminary data show encouraging results after treatment with UNK acid .    2.573203889215076
however , there are no data concerning the delay or prevention of progress of the disease with this drug , because follow - up time is not yet long enough .    2.7774121395107185
isolated bile duct strictures should be treated endoscopically .    2.826570179601474
the possible effect of proctocolectomy on the course of psc is controversial .    2.546398844793943
liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for psc in its final stage .    2.7328101080136293
the 5 - year survival rate ( 89 % ) is significantly better than after transplantation for other indications .    2.41890401688821
patients with ulcerative colitis have to be followed up by lifelong colonoscopy .    2.881597169309179
although the course of uc after transplantation is mostly asymptomatic , these patients are at higher risk for colorectal cancer .    2.6598196443093296
on 3 june 1998 a high - speed train ( inter city express , ice ) UNK with a bridge at a speed of 200 km / h .    2.149497704831425
the bridge collapsed and the rear UNK of the train were UNK into it with the power of the rear UNK .    2.5585339929677815
the accident caused 101 deaths and 103 injuries .    2.274943849485033
four minutes after the accident the alarm was raised , and 16 minutes after the accident the first doctor was on the scene , arriving from UNK , approx .    2.1742005493672507
severe complications after UNK treatments rarely occur .    2.5235234928606607
they happen mostly when manipulating the atlantoaxial and the UNK articulations or when not attending to the contraindications like partial dislocation and UNK .    2.065181900841667
therefore , x - ray pictures from the part of the vertebral region to be treated are inevitable and likewise the medical scientific associations demand them uniformly to minimize the risks .    2.5398749384853896
nevertheless , our case - report shows also inconspicuous radiological findings do not exclude local tumor infestation of the bones with possible deleterious results for the patient treated by the UNK .    2.12351881651765
in patients with painful , possibly hemorrhagic vesicles or black crusts , especially on hands / fingers or face / neck with typical history ( contact to cows or UNK / cats ) the possibility of a cowpox / catpox infection has to be considered .    1.9016459212453065
the clinical diagnosis can be confirmed with the electron microscopy ; cytoplasmic inclusions may be detected histologically .    2.3312555784254703
further useful diagnostic tools are the identification of the cowpox / catpox virus by pcr or in cell culture as well as serological tests to detect virus specific antibodies .    2.396688452740327
we report the development of typical skin lesions of a cowpox / catpox infection in two female patients who had contact with cows or cats .    2.5205133586392927
recent diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are also discussed .    3.194359004816094
the laboratory findings of hemolysis , elevated liver enzymes and low platelets are signs of an acute pregnancy complication often associated with abdominal pain and intrauterine growth retardation .    2.392270383595029
a high coincidence with symptoms of preeclampsia is observed .    2.4238813658034144
the high rate of complications and the restitution of laboratory findings to normal values following cessation of pregnancy have led to the general recommendation of immediate delivery for about a decade .    2.363396974161273
however , the fact that hellp syndrome can also occur for up to 1 week post - partum and the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancy call this former concept of management into question , in particular , since there is a high rate of UNK complications after cesarean section in acute hellp syndrome .    2.4542511329642926
because of the correlation of complications of hellp syndrome with those of severe preeclampsia , the indication for delivery should be based on the signs of preeclampsia and additional clinical features .    2.6909914153817573
the results of studies on prolongation of pregnancies in hellp syndrome and severe preeclampsia support this concept .    2.0781724498568495
innervation of the head and neck differs from other regions of the body in certain respects .    2.838366654136144
in particular , besides the external UNK nucleus , thick - calibre neck muscle afferents project directly , to the vestibular nuclear complex .    2.0013099722478285
proprioceptive input via indirect UNK pathways is also most prominent from c2 and 3 compared to more caudal levels .    1.9566013895746595
likewise , thin calibre , mainly nociceptive afferents from cervical segments are UNK via the UNK nuclei in the rostral pons to limbic structures different from the targets of thoracolumbar afferents .    1.868368851022184
it is tempting to consider these UNK peculiarities relevant for the pathogenesis of the UNK symptoms after whiplash injury .    2.932966476406931
in some recent german textbooks of pain management there is maintained that psychological dependence to opioids in pain patients is not a real problem .    2.1073386392594666
the evidence for this statement is reviewed .    2.7307049925533833
real bone tumors are rarely encountered in the daily routine of radiological practice .    2.5465868704707466
therefore , for a general radiologist there is no need for a specialist knowledge on this field .    2.851906557811016
however , he should be able to distinguish benign from malignant lesions in order to avoid unnecessary biopsies .    2.604672882332278
a systematic approach towards osteolytic lesions , e . g . according to the classification of UNK , is mandatory .    3.240878738756605
ct and mri are indicated to clear up the anatomy in areas of superposition UNK in conventional radiology and to determine the inner structure of a lesion , e . g . fatty tissue , liquid / solid .    2.2683396662077397
this paper highlights the advantages and disadvantages and the cost - effective use of the imaging modalities including scintigraphy in the diagnosis of bone tumors and tumor - like lesions .    2.9137163184454953
guidelines for the management of bony lesions will be given in detail .    2.974423598284881
the option and necessity for a specialist second opinion is emphasized .    2.283849591304966
during routine middle ear surgery prototypes of implantable piezoelectric hearing aid transducers were coupled to the ossicular chain of 28 patients .    2.206872524832426
pure tone thresholds in a broad frequency range ( 250 hz - 8 khz ) and perception of music were the basis of UNK evaluation of the transfer properties of the prototypes in this human study .    2.524757093711897
the dynamics for music reached 32 db , which was identical with the results of the preoperative investigations using hi - fi UNK ( 33 db ) .    2.516503736316926
the low nonlinear distortions of around 0 . 1 % and the frequency range up to 10 khz are reflected in the positive evaluation of sound quality by 84 % of the patients involved .    2.6454899377995065
the study is the basis for realizing a piezoelectric transducer designed for routine clinical implantations .    2.6727627602629735
background : baker et al .    2.4005399801930083
used a co2 laser for UNK for the first time .    3.009014345138886
the UNK co2 laser provides a sophisticated instrument that makes more application alternatives possible in ophthalmology .    1.990176412654938
several investigations prove that monaural acoustic deprivation induces detrimental changes in the auditory pathway .    2.4170245629168168
so far the major interest focused on degenerative processes on the deprived side , while effects on the contralateral untreated side were not taken into consideration .    2.032165012903788
this UNK study investigates effects of early monaural acoustic deprivation on the functional development of the acoustically evoked auditory brainstem response ( abr ) in the mongolian UNK .    2.3859241185661233
young UNK were UNK by a single UNK application of UNK sulfate .    3.464062910590459
the abr development on the contralateral side differed in a late developmental period from that of normally hearing animals .    2.2010493021582778
these changes persisted until adulthood .    2.5314231863792678
between day 55 and day 90 a significant 5 db decrease of the abr thresholds and a significant shortening of the interpeak latency ii - v occured .    2.172678494501828
the results confirm that a complete monaural deprivation during the sensible or critical period leads on the contralateral side to plastic or compensatory changes in the auditory brainstem .    2.087083529980196
there are estimated to be 20 million people blinded by UNK , 80 - 90 % of whom live in UNK areas of developing countries where expert surgical resources are scarce .    2.223460201211234
the majority of all cataract operations are still UNK extractions ( UNK ) .    2.427326915834541
UNK correction using UNK is UNK in developing countries .    2.8858022894681645
this study was undertaken to evaluate the safety of UNK open loop anterior chamber intraocular lenses ( ac iols ) .    2.4135093889244805
dorsal fusion with the internal fixator has become the standard treatment of instabilities and deformities of the thoracolumbar spine .    2.5015029111733753
with our new device , the modular spine fixator ( msf ) , which has been specially designed for short - distance instrumentations , we have increasingly been treating unstable injuries of the thoracolumbar spine by one - level stabilization .    2.3645460048047475
prerequisite is an accurate evaluation of the indication , including ct and mri to assess the involvement of the intervertebral disc and the UNK structures .    3.6090530951035973
the operative technique differs in some details from the procedure in UNK - level instrumentations , especially concerning the application of the pedicle screws .    2.521617519436774
since the beginning of 1993 we also perform anterior autogenic transpedicular bone grafting .    2.2239476041065243
between UNK 1991 and july 1995 , 57 one - level UNK with the msf were performed .    2.394722379455062
of the 57 patients operated on 39 , 27 men and 12 women , with an average age of 41 years , have had a clinical and radiographic follow - up examination so far , on average , 27 months after the accident .    2.7196693411862665
seventeen patients were completely free of pain and 17 patients ( were only ) UNK to weather changes or had minor pain during great physical stress .    2.1893154380456785
five patients had pain even during slight physical stress or at rest .    2.269198754931379
the preoperatively measured cobb angle was 15 . 1 ° on average , after the operation 5 . 2 ° , and at the time of the follow - up examination amounted to 8 . 1 ° .    3.1526829308993065
the patients ' range of motion was normal .    3.0786498674690943
only five minor complications have been seen .    2.793007354314227
no implant fatigue failure has been noted in this series .    2.417524133270008
we derive from these results that , for correct indications , one - level stabilization can be performed successfully and should be firmly established in the operative treatment of unstable fractures of the thoracolumbar spine .    2.767912649794031
between may 1995 and march 1996 we were able to diagnose and remove glomus tumors of the left nasal cavity from three female patients .    2.6644693734480316
ages of the patients were 9 , 36 and 74 years .    3.1379638716721083
all patients suffered from a frequent epistaxis and all were extremely sensitive to the slightest nasal touch .    2.318280996609551
one patient reported breathing difficulties due to nasal congestion .    2.211226529394157
examination revealed a tumor that filled the entire nasal cavity .    2.5243564263266793
the method of choice in treatment of these tumors is surgical removal .    3.3594631053784343
UNK , non - chromaffin paraganglioma , UNK , cavernous hemangioma and nevus cell nevi have to be excluded by histology and immunohistochemical techniques .    2.7264395184336516
from a clinical perspective the bleeding septal UNK ( granuloma UNK sive pyogenicum sive UNK ) has to be considered because it often comes from UNK ' s plexus , has a mushroom - like appearance and bleeds slightly .    2.2347660975364363
background : gynaecological surgery including laparoscopy is frequently associated with ponv .    2.2495242636149753
therefore , choosing an anaesthetic with only little side effects in operations UNK for outpatient surgery is at least as important as applying anaesthetics that enable fast - tracking .    2.14583935305737
the reliability of continuous UNK oximetry in cerebral venous blood and its correlation with intracranial and cerebral perfusion pressures ( pressure - volume curve ) were examined in an experimental porcine study .    2.1035749502410637
in a population - based study of 110 women between 53 and 82 years of age ( mean age 64 . 5 + / - 7 . 9 years ) static posturography data were compared to functional items of gait and balance in common geriatric mobility scales .    2.3857020609060675
posturographic data of double - stance with eyes open and eyes closed ( dseo ; dsec ) did not differ from those of a group of healthy women previously tested for intact nervous system function .    2.0925001453029917
the total neuromuscular score - roughly corresponding to the well - known UNK score - did not correlate to the posturographic measures .    2.281184852274644
dsec correlated with the items " rapid walking " and " single - stance left leg " .    2.504938762719815
age , vision , and neuropsychologic test results correlated with dseo , " rapid walking " , " single - stance right leg " , " single - stance left leg " , and " walking a figure eight " .    2.0910391500923438
multiple linear regression confirmed the impact of age , vision , dseo , and dsec on " rapid walking " with a 34 % variance explanation .    2.1743598764035874
posturographic parameters did predict other selected gait and balance items .    2.2743431604878492
when used in older women living independently in the community , parameters of static posturography reflect to some extent the functional disabilities of gait and balance .    2.1054897777237422
the ocular surface epithelia with the tear film as a unit provide clear vision and comfort and serve as the first line of defense .    2.1271747836574497
it is important to understand how ocular surface health is maintained and how ocular surface failure occurs .    2.125786563450088
furthermore , it is timely to summarize new information concerning action mechanisms and clinical uses of amniotic membrane transplantation for ocular surface reconstruction .    2.065004427488877
when appropriately processed and preserved , amniotic membrane as a native matrix can be used as a graft to restore conjunctival surfaces following removal of lesions such as pterygium , tumor , scar , UNK , and UNK .    2.2083747046857813
it can also be used as a graft to restore corneal surfaces suffering from limbal stem - cell deficiency .    2.3617431384556795
for partial limbal deficiency , amniotic membrane alone is frequently sufficient , while for total limbal deficiency it needs to be combined with limbal stem - cell transplantation with or without corneal transplantation .    2.166132187382617
when used as a graft or patch , amniotic membrane can facilitate healing of persistent corneal ulcers and recurrent corneal erosion and reduce corneal UNK following keratectomy .    1.9999123896546638
reported data indicate that amniotic membrane transplantation facilitates rapid healing with recovery of a normal epithelial phenotype in the epithelium and reduces inflammation , vascularization , and scarring in the stroma .    2.043654921455458
purpose : UNK of mri in radiotherapy of UNK UNK .    3.0567034344617965
according to the recommendations of the german ophthalmological UNK ( UNK ) , prk in myopic patients between - 1 . 0 dpt and - 6 . 0 dpt is a scientific UNK treatment .    2.9857639780512644
the risks of the treatment , however , increase in myopia above - 6 . 0 dpt .    3.3048925335844332
introduction : improved socio - economic conditions have led to an increase of adult height during the last century .    2.850115799379044
if excessive height is regarded as a serious psychological UNK , final height can be reduced by early and high doses treatment with sexual steroids .    2.4087962241330847
this therapy influences pubertal development and growth of healthy adolescents .    2.2896295994677245
for that reason patients should be carefully selected , taking into account the benefits and possible side effects .    2.424828439189999
colour measurements were performed on UNK substances of whitish to slightly yellow UNK ( cocaine samples of different composition ) in order to give an unequivocal optical description of the samples and relate them to control samples .    2.298285979651462
the measurements were carried out with a spectrophotometer ( carl - zeiss - jena UNK , UNK 400 ) using a UNK bulb as light source ( standard UNK UNK ) .    2.3976696252671883
colorimetric classification was made on the basis of the cie - l * a * b * - values .    2.094957187774191
the examination showed that specimens of similar or different chemical composition which could not be distinguished macroscopically revealed characteristic differences in the cie - l * a * b * - measures .    1.9896678209497418
the method gives a first clue for orientation within a few minutes when comparing substances in specimens of different origin .    2.159748571169579
eighty - five patients with grade 2 or grade 3 sprains of the acromioclavicular ( ac ) joint were evaluated clinically and radiographically 32 months after injury .    2.2426485916008336
group i included 34 patients with grade 2 sprains ( tossy ii ) and group ii included 51 patients with grade 3 injuries ( tossy iii ) .    2.2594176992658164
in group i , 15 patients were treated surgically ( group i a ) and 19 patients were treated conservatively ( group i b ) , while in group ii , 41 patients were treated surgically ( group ii a ) and 10 patients were treated conservatively ( group ii b ) .    3.227522358652834
at surgery open reduction and transarticular fixation of the ac joint with kirschner wires was performed .    2.5841336104157406
conservative treatment included the initial use of a sling or a UNK bandage and early performance of range - of - motion exercises .    2.3908711897245234
shoulder function was assessed according to the score devised by constant and murley .    2.657743840555711
in both groups , 97 of 100 possible points ( minimum 72 , maximum 100 ) were obtained after conservative and after surgical treatment .    2.239166030436383
nine of 10 patients ( 90 % ) with grade 3 sprains ( group iib ) had more pronounced displacement and increased mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle after UNK treatment .    2.6968954157821887
after surgery , dislocation and increased horizontal , mobility of the lateral end of the clavicle occurred in 18 ( 44 % ) of 41 patients with grade 3 sprains ( group ii a p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.6606116278687852
however , these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome .    2.4524779389022284
at follow - up there was a significant increase in degenerative changes seen on radio - graphs ( p < 0 . 035 ) in all patients .    2.643298336771197
again these findings did not correlate with the functional outcome .    2.5548681110304705
more degenerative radiological changes were observed in patients who had undergone surgery ( p < 0 . UNK ) .    2.8789877327047018
patients with grade 2 sprains were more frequently restricted in sporting activity after surgery ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.096104696004056
patients with grade 3 sprains who were treated surgically complained of pain more frequently ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and they returned to work later than patients who were treated conservatively after grade 3 sprains .    2.7052989350764487
an additional rehabilitation program guided by a UNK seemed to have no impact on the functional outcome .    2.835535941383359
a total of 56 patients were treated by surgery .    3.1940944990770133
among these patients 11 complications occurred , requiring five additional surgical procedures .    2.1392485628967575
among 29 conservatively treated patients , only in 1 patient did UNK located arthritic changes of the ac joint have to be removed .    2.7777123791667235
macular amyloidosis ( ma ) and lichen amyloidosus ( la ) are the two major variants of the primary cutaneous amyloidoses which present with severe and therapy resistent itching .    2.286818227913236
various therapeutic modalities such as antihistamines , intralesional injection or topical application of corticosteroids , etretinate , uvb irradiation and UNK have been employed with variable success .    2.180169728194139
recently , in a few case reports authors have observed encouraging beneficial clinical effects by using topical UNK UNK ( dmso ) .    2.372575092674248
in our study 10 patients with either ma or la or biphasic amyloidosis were treated with a 50 % solution of dmso in water .    2.474637136890942
9 of them showed marked clinical improvement at the end of 6 - 20 weeks of treatment .    2.6217194003731508
degranulation and depletion of the mast cells by dmso is the most probable explanation for the rapid improvement of itching beginning within the first week of therapy .    2.5933636796162496
remarkable flattening of the lichenoid papules which was obtained within 11 weeks of treatment is interpreted as a result of the improvement of itching and the related scratch effect .    2.693027733619841
histological examination after treatment revealed no disappearance of amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis .    2.2816478540441834
in the follow - up period relapses of itching and papules were observed .    2.458592484914037
therefore further studies are needed to find out the optimal procedure of therapy .    2.6070897011128253
as early as 1974 , UNK advocated the prone position for ventilated patients [ 5 ] .    2.3428500450723098
he suggested that this position might enhance ventilation of the dorsal parts of the lungs , thereby improving oxygenation .    2.5874397932920417
these considerations have been confirmed by several experimental and clinical studies [ 1 , 6 , 13 , 17 ] .    2.6161115625349933
better secretion removal , decreased intrapulmonary shunting , and an increased frc are thought to be responsible for the observed improvement of oxygenation .    2.5363247583477198
however , the prone position never became very popular in the clinical treatment of the adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) .    2.4610393941497666
routine performance of thoracic ct scans in ards patients demonstrated preferential distribution of pathological densities in the dependent lung areas .    2.052885652015614
the prone position therefore could possibly benefit these patients , as shown by two recent studies [ 8 , 11 ] .    2.5902727777911254
the aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position on gas exchange and thoracic ct findings in multiple - trauma patients .    2.298961170314881
seven ventilated intensive care patients with severe ards ( murray score > 2 . 5 [ 9 ] , quotient > 0 . 7 [ 4 ] , mean airway pressure > 18 cm h2o , thoracic ct scan showing dorsal atelectases ) were included in the study .    2.3801323967690102
patients were turned from the supine to the prone position at 12 - h intervals using an air - UNK bed ( UNK , austria ) .    2.257883627553415
redistribution of UNK or atelectatic dependent lung areas was verified by means of repeated thoracic ct scans ( figs .    2.597271745806396
the patients were intermittently turned for 6 . 5 + / - 1 . 1 days .    2.9660553160065852
the course of gas exchange is shown in figs .    2.8532749513186673
initially , improvement of the respiratory quotient could only be achieved during prone positioning , from the 2nd day in the supine position as well .    2.6392226210116085
intrapulmonary shunting showed a similar trend ( figs .    2.371015922568762
no significant changes in cardiovascular parameters could be observed .    2.586955884741338
control thoracic ct scans showed uniform reduction of atelectases in dependent lung areas ( figs .    2.226545438624214
the inspiratory fraction of oxygen could be reduced significantly as of the 2nd day ( fig .    2.3918698003190997
constant levels of positive end - expiratory pressure and tidal volume were associated with decreasing mean and plateau airway pressures ( fig .    2.148768302744315
repeatedly turning the patient to the prone position produced long - lasting improvement of arterial oxygenation , which persists up to the end of the weaning process .    2.5911841023276647
this is in good accordance with other studies [ 1 , 2 , 6 , 8 , 11 , 13 , 17 ] , however , this is the first study to report an observation period of more than 6 days of repeatedly turning the patient .    2.6551992951151075
these positive effects on gas exchange can be attributed to sudden improvement of the ventilation - perfusion ratio within the lung areas that become dependent after turning to the prone position .    2.1943679634222524
due to reduced hydrostatic pressure [ 11 ] and relative hyperventilation [ 7 , 16 ] , previously collapsed alveoli are recruited in the lung areas that become non - dependent after turning to the prone position .    1.8695204917635748
after a gynecological operation under therapy with unfractionated and low molecular weight heparin , a 63 year old patient developed right - sided ascending pelvic thrombosis with multiple pulmonary embolism and infarction pneumonia , septic - toxic circulatory failure , and thrombocytopenia .    2.1134111821165558
heparin - associated thrombocytopenia ( hat ) type ii was diagnosed .    2.280531543572428
because of contraindications against thrombolysis a cava - filter was implanted , heparin therapy was stopped , and anticoagulation with recombinant hirudin was started .    1.9527968169087813
UNK of this , an arterial thrombosis of the a . UNK UNK developed and had to be treated surgically .    3.2897696893257535
from this time on , no further thromboembolic complications were noticed .    2.3277429207050986
overlapping coumarin therapy was begun .    2.5981995264312876
due to ubiquitous coumarin - necrosis , rapid progressive toxic circulatory failure with disseminated intravascular coagulation ( dic ) developed two days after terminating hirudin therapy necessitating high dose catecholamine therapy .    1.8542500694119688
a second course of hirudin resulted in complete restitution of the coumarin - necrosis without the need for re - operation .    2.1618841996362614
subsequent coumarin - therapy , which was gradually increased over two weeks , was without further complications .    2.541390847136887
thus , hirudin appears to be a new and safe alternative to a therapy with the UNK danaparoid in hat type ii with fulminant thromboembolic complications and especially in coumarin - necrosis with critical septic - toxic circulatory failure and dic .    2.3670330876249817
a prospective process - analysis evaluating organizational , medical and medical - technical alterations and real - time - documentation during out - of - hospital resuscitations ( n = 71 ) was performed due to the definitions of the " utstein - style " .    2.5009428314202036
the gaseous radical nitric oxide ( no ) is UNK by conversion of l - arginine to l - UNK by one cytokine inducible form ( inos ) , which becomes active only within hours after the inducing event , and by two UNK expressed forms , endothelial ( UNK ) and neuronal ( nnos ) , which are regulated by the UNK concentration of free ca2 + .    2.3710813736422764
brain nnos is physiologically present in discrete populations of neurons , which are all UNK by glutamate via the UNK n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor , which controls a ca2 + channel .    2.0299091982562674
after its diffusion into the UNK space , no may activate in neurons , which as a rule do not stain for nos , soluble UNK UNK and formation of cgmp as an intracellular messenger .    2.127533014007338
beyond that , no is important as a feedback regulator of glutamatergic excitation .    2.196778439055504
no as a UNK agent enhances disulfide bonding of UNK UNK ( UNK ) groups of the redox modulatory site of the nmda receptor complex and thereby down - regulates its ca2 + channel activity .    2.4554237634900997
histochemically studies have revealed the presence of large number of nos containing neurons in the UNK and UNK UNK of hypothalamic nuclei .    3.562362181874781
numerous studies conform to the view that no participates in the control of many different neurosecretory processes , especially of the UNK - releasing hormone ( crh ) neurosecretory system .    2.589849203243465
the redox - modulatory site of the nmda receptor appears , therefore , as a critical structure in the control of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical ( hpa ) axis .    2.26697672739106
moreover , glucocorticoids augment neuronal UNK by increasing the expression of glutamate receptors and inhibition of glutamate reuptake .    2.1659018463363156
in attempting to explain the many conflicting results obtained in studies with no , it may be worthwhile to consider that the actual redox - environment of distinct loci of the brain may determine the final function of no , acting either as a transmitter or UNK or , in the worst case , causing UNK .    2.1707230731761373
it seems likely that any kind of stress by altering the ratio of reduced vs UNK UNK within the central nervous system influences neuronal UNK , with no working either as an amplifier or as a feedback regulator of neuronal excitation or inhibition , which may alter acutely or chronically , among others , the homeostasis of a given neurosecretory system .    2.043397011584038
purpose : to study early and late findings of macular retinal thickness in patients with hypotony following filtering procedures .    2.4819056366959376
even in the era of coronary stenting , acute coronary artery occlusion continues to represent a significant limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) .    2.1919223652923674
despite application of heparin and aspirin , abrupt vessel closure still occurs in 2 - 8 % , depending on the definition applied .    2.6156265736857733
especially patients receiving ptca for acute coronary syndromes are at high risk for abrupt vessel closure .    2.4462595330682535
the formation of an intracoronary thrombus plays a central role in the pathogenesis of abrupt vessel closure .    2.6491462957996275
dipyridamole induces dilatation of coronary arteries and prevents platelet aggregation by a mechanism that differs from that of aspirin .    2.2223284464667517
the primary purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adjunctive local intracoronary therapy with dipyridamole could reduce the incidence of coronary artery occlusion following ptca .    2.7611728921646397
secondary UNK were defined as myocardial infarction , necessity for bypass grafting , and death .    2.5702989066027326
the intravesical instillation of bcg ( UNK UNK - UNK ) in cases of relapsed superficial bladder cancer is an acknowledged kind of prophylaxis .    2.9422642049633647
it is UNK up to now whether a verification of the immune systems competence is necessary .    2.6161196342580992
the recommendations in this problem are very different .    2.51298954944821
in conclusion to the recent literature we think that a verification of the immune system before bcg UNK in the urinary bladder has not a prognostic value .    2.520039362609481
additionally , the legal UNK of this UNK is doubtful .    2.897175108178812
discoid meniscus is one of the UNK anatomical variations of the meniscus .    3.381680875112596
there is at the moment no consensus on the aetiology of discoid meniscus .    2.56080746124639
according to UNK three types can be differentiated : the complete form , the incomplete form and the UNK wrisberg form .    2.601728174633221
discoid meniscus frequently remains asymptomatic and thus requires no treatment .    2.2207275386318535
partial meniscectomy is recommended for treatment of the stable form , while for the unstable forms total meniscectomy is generally regarded as the treatment of choice , since the instability means that rupture of residual meniscus would be possible .    2.655454084802253
a fourteen years old girl showed the classic signs of acrocephalosyndactyly i : dysostosis UNK with hypertelorism , exophthalmus , UNK , amblyopia and cleft palate as well as UNK of the fingers and toes .    2.54098469688023
the feet showed on both side a 6 cm long horny band .    2.1392580345180545
since the UNK year of life , she had suffered from papulo - pustular acne with many UNK .    2.427721778981753
her menstruation started one year later .    2.7713486133933274
at time of her birth , her father was 54 years old , and her mother 36 years old .    2.2672430604380343
two elder UNK are healthy .    2.6200757215871606
the inheritance of acrocephalosyndactyly i is usually autosomal dominant , but sporadic cases are frequent .    2.093777688027768
objective : cognitive dysfunction is a known problem after operations and may be especially relevant in the elderly .    2.3890086884947346
the aim of this international multicentre study was to investigate short - and long - term cognitive dysfunction in elderly patients and to elucidate the relevance of hypoxaemia and hypotension as causative factors .    2.4348720587351136
autosomal recessive inheritance , intrauterine growth retardation , short stature , microcephaly , distinct facial UNK , UNK retardation , and often UNK eczematous skin lesions distinguish the rare dubowitz syndrome .    2.1205126582328093
here a pair of monozygotic twins with dubowitz syndrome and clear - cut atopic eczema is presented .    2.1850861095053835
humeral shaft fractures can be treated either conservatively or operatively .    3.0192925890855347
plating of the humerus is the established operative method , but recently interest has also been focussed on intramedullary nailing .    2.30121345310496
closed reduction in 55 / 59 cases .    2.48197982724235
one infection ( soft tissue ) ; 2 / 48 pseudarthrosis ( indication for nailing : pseudarthrosis ! ) .    2.006329408372047
no iatrogenic palsy of the radial nerve .    2.9537198533180784
functional postoperative treatment in all 44 cases of humeral fractures after adequate trauma .    2.239112879864464
one poor functional result : periarticular ossification after retrograde nailing , possibly connected with long - term respiratory treatment after trauma .    2.225211057393051
treatment of humeral shaft fractures by intramedullary nailing is favoured in our clinic ( low complication rates , excellent or good functional results , limited approaches , small scars ) .    2.2182275340908544
all other fractures of the humeral shaft can be treated by each of the implants used in our clinic .    3.2859220504884283
pathological fractures are an excellent indication for intramedullary stabilization .    2.4310723884272325
these patients benefit from stable fixation without intense surgical trauma .    2.2880184352262396
pseudarthrosis , according to our limited experience , seems to require plating plus bone grafting .    2.514396444926783
2 - 4 % of vascular injuries need operative UNK .    2.9510543888798706
in polytraumatized patients the rate is even 10 % .    2.5057268819774015
arterial vascular repair should precede venous reconstruction and orthopaedic stabilization due to limb threatening ischemia .    1.989535903705203
penetration or blunt vascular trauma result either in acute blood loss , ischemia or UNK compression .    2.190040924747133
reperfusion syndrom leads to vital threat of patient .    2.3700899862013887
clinical assessment , measurement of limb pressures using a doppler device and use of duplex ultrasonography are reliable UNK in the rapid evaluation .    2.522681294211149
arteriography is rarely indicated and should be UNK for patients with abnormal physical examination .    3.481924854370201
minimizing ischemia ( 6 - 8 h ) is an important factor in UNK limb salvage .    2.9711539900214965
vascular repair include direct anastomosis or lateral suture repair mostly combined with primary shortening of the extremity .    2.2840587077780374
in most cases autogenous vein graft is required .    2.3662059254966668
UNK , arteriovenous fistula and pseudoaneurysms are possible complications .    2.2997478199778887
stabilisation of the fracture has priority over vascular reconstruction .    2.8526685658209145
the initial steps to success are surgical debridement , adequate bony stabilization mostly by external fixation , revascularisation of vascular injury , immediate UNK decompression and early soft - tissue reconstruction .    2.011388188831644
the best results are obtained when a UNK approach is used combining expertise in orthopedic surgery , vascular surgery and plastic surgery .    2.2808389724744043
in secondary prevention , statins are cost - effective and even more cost - effective than other lipid lowering drugs .    2.4448500266870337
statins are especially favorable in patients with previous myocardial infarction compared to those with angina pectoris .    2.8287750687894566
for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease , statins should be administered generously .    2.621979839182104
in primary prevention , statins are effective but not cost - efficient .    2.355300765342912
unfavorable results have to be expected especially in premenopausal women , younger patients , and in those with a low risk factor profile .    3.3113508189860554
for population based primary prevention , only dietary measures can be advocated ; however , apart from a serious lack of compliance their efficiency has not yet been proven .    2.2930390142073778
preventive measures have their own prize ; in general they are considered not to prevent coronary heart disease but retard it .    2.1873872587107552
therefore , such therapeutic interventions can be assumed not to reduce but rather to increase the " direct " medical costs .    2.326738416908749
furthermore , successful prevention of coronary heart disease leads , due to life - prolongation , to an increase in people out of work and in disabled patients due to age and / or disease .    2.644184927688478
therefore , an increase especially of the " indirect " costs for unemployment , pension , nursing homes , etc .    2.454564108248087
background : there are three fields where the the biochemical cardiac markers creatine kinase ( ck ) , its UNK mb ( ck - mb ) , UNK , and troponin can play an important role : ( 1 ) the primary diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) , ( 2 ) identification of patients suffering from unstable angina with minor myocardial damage ( UNK ) and consecutively increased risk for major cardiovascular events , and ( 3 ) assessment of coronary reperfusion after intravenous thrombolysis .    2.519546490711696
mrsa / UNK infections are a major problem in hospitals and although in orthopaedic units the incidence is low awareness of this problem is necessary .    2.427720614226138
once a mrsa strain has been isolated the strict use of the hygiene precautions has to be applied to avoid epidemic spread of the strain .    2.61641329205389
the staff has to use gloves and UNK whilst treating the patient .    2.219286138037829
a UNK hand wash solution has to be used after taking off the gloves and before leaving the isolation room .    2.318842707945848
patient and staff have to be informed about the UNK and the way of infection spread so that infection UNK rules are fulfilled .    3.0386134548386248
antibiotics should only be used in clinically well defined cases and the overall use of antibiotics should be reduced to lower the incidence of mrsa / e isolates .    2.7942004100313818
the problems of an mrsa case and its successful treatment are demonstrated .    2.3650695080339372
a microphone constructed for implantation in the posterior wall of the auditory canal and a piezoelectric transducer serving as the main components of an implantable hearing aid were UNK implanted in five patients during middle ear surgery under local anesthesia .    2.36406794752566
the microphone was positioned beneath the skin of the auditory canal such that it completely covered the microphone membrane .    2.188372117943058
the vibratory element of the transducer was coupled to the malleus in four patients with normal ossicular chains and directly to the stapes in one patient with missing incus .    2.4835615106080438
the microphone and transducer were electrically connected with an external battery - UNK signal amplifier .    2.1965724009065255
speech material and music were presented in the operation room at a sound level of 65 db spl under free - field conditions .    2.0315884629894607
the patients had to estimate the quality of speech , music , and their own voice as well as the effects of bone - conducting noises .    3.1827485136038884
all patients were able to UNK with the system .    3.3996653983307583
an intraoperative talk without vision contact was possible without any problems , as was understanding of UNK ( " freiburger UNK " ) .    2.3805766886827873
perception of music was judged as " clear and UNK with all broadband component . "    2.334853054043011
the estimation was also valid for one patient with a sensorineural hearing loss .    2.7481132522680554
one patient declared the music to be " a little of UNK . "    2.5139159861720963
bone - conducted sound was estimated as normal in two patients , better than without an implant in one patient with sensorineural hearing loss , and " somewhat metallic " in another patient .    2.5764529925079582
hearing the own voice was considered " normal " in two cases " UNK " in one case , and " a little bit UNK " in another case .    3.0750989886810416
an amplification factor that can be technically realized in an implantable hearing aid was necessary for one of the patients with sensorineural hearing loss to perceive music at a pleasant volume .    2.6229424518376465
on the basis of this study , essential requirements for the construction of a fully implantable hearing aid are fulfilled .    2.868257490655564
we report a patient with metachromatic UNK ( mld ) with a first manifestation of homicide .    2.709846388000691
on admission the patient showed a UNK - like syndrom with inappropriate affect , thought disorder and behavioral changes .    2.5359739059949407
magnetic resonance tomography ( mrt ) findings suggested a diagnosis of mld , which was confirmed by a decreased activity of leucocyte UNK a and an excessive urinary UNK excretion .    2.2798960971850057
the cervical UNK myelopathy is the most frequent spinal dysfunction .    3.014614702053781
its spontaneous course is very variable , from progress to stagnation .    2.2520427338580866
this makes prognosis and decision - making difficult for conservative or operative treatment .    2.4392521504787066
the authors attempt to provide some basis for decision - making by observing the individual course of neural dysfunction , consideration of morphometric data and the use of functional scores .    2.1822791134991575
to advise a patient , the outcome of conservative and operative treatment as described in the literature has to be considered , as well as the possible complications .    3.3182243393470503
the advantages and disadvantages of surgery from the anterior and posterior approach are discussed .    2.4550840310963635
operative planning according to the individual condition is suggested .    3.1753984894757243
operative techniques of anterior decompression and fusion are contrasted to UNK .    2.3005084758071406
subject : in a 7 ; 11 year old boy with trichotillomania ( icd - 10 UNK . 3 ) , attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( UNK ) ( icd - 10 UNK . 1 ) , and subclinical minimal cerebral dysfunction , UNK ( UNK ) medication resulted in a remarkable improvement : UNK interruption of trichotillomania with regrowth of hair .    2.8599114403145705
an essential feature of the known procedures for the analysis of the ecg signal is the splitting of the ecg into individual parameters which are subsequently processed in defined decision trees , neuronal networks or statistical procedures to diagnostic information .    2.217399793958034
the correctness of the diagnostic statements thus substantially depends on the suitable selection and the exact determination of the individual criteria .    2.832412294284918
the analysis algorithm and the expert knowledge are closely linked due to the procedure .    2.6209161987262046
this paper presents a new procedure or the evaluation of signals of medical sensor systems by the example of the ecg .    2.410238558710133
unlike the methods used up to now , this procedure is not based on an ever more profound splitting of the ecg signal into individual features .    2.573677591724577
furthermore , analysis algorithm and knowledge base are separated from each other .    2.273167691427998
the consideration underlying the procedure is that two ecgs whose leads show identical or very similar signal patterns indicate identical or at least very similar cardiological diagnoses .    2.029783233446103
as this assumption is the basis of medical experience , it should be possible to compare the signal patterns of the leads of an unknown ecg with those of the leads of the reference ecgs from a database and to draw conclusions for the diagnosis of the unknown ecg .    2.565911217508156
for this purpose , those ecgs are searched in an ecg database whose leads show greatest agreement with the signal pattern of the unknown ecg .    1.9187993953330105
the function of the method was established with the aid of the ecg signal database UNK with 249 ecgs for the diagnostic groups : infarcts and healthy reference persons from a data inventory of 550 ecgs .    2.2332477981524774
it can be seen from the results that the presented procedure which is based on signal pattern recognition is a new approach to deriving diagnostic information from the ecg signal at least for the diagnostic group of myocardial infarcts .    2.4730659902557957
purpose : the technical conditions , the optimized scanning protocols and the facilities of virtual endoscopy ( ve ) are presented in an overview .    2.0852713967875527
during a 4 - week ambulatory UNK rehabilitation program , 262 patients with coronary artery disease ( cad ) , UNK men and 27 women , 53 . 6 + / - 10 . 2 years , performed 30 . 5 + / - 2 , 9 exercise units .    2.5777619434841794
before and after the rehabilitation program exercise , capacity was assessed by bicycle ergometry .    2.6876055489539863
there was a significant ( p < 0 . 001 ) increase in the maximum exercise capacity at the end of the program ( 105 . 3 + / - 32 . 3 vs . 121 . 9 + / - 37 . 3 w ) .    2.6582701096525527
physical work capacity on the 2 . 0 mmol lactate level improved ( p < 0 . 001 ) from 72 . 2 + / - 23 . 5 to 86 . 4 + / - 25 . 8 w , on the 2 . 5 mmol / l level ( p < 0 . 001 ) from 83 . 5 + / - 23 . 2 to 97 . 4 + / - 26 . 4 w , and on the 3 . 0 mmol / l level ( p < 0 . 001 ) from 93 . 1 + / - 23 . 0 to 106 . 6 + / - 26 . 1 w . despite enhanced performance , heart rate remained unaltered on the 2 . 0 , 2 . 5 , and 3 . 0 mmol / l lactate level .    2.6869657513725618
furthermore , UNK performance on predefined heart rate levels was significantly ( p < 0 . 001 ) increased : 85 / min : from 56 . 0 + / - 24 . 1 to 65 . 8 + / - 24 . 5 w ; 90 / min : from 62 . 0 + / - 27 . 3 to 71 . 2 + / - 26 w ; 95 / min : from 67 . 2 + / - 26 . 4 to 77 . 5 + / - 27 . 6 w ; 100 / min : from 71 . 1 + / - 29 . 6 to 80 . 6 + / - 28 . 1 w ; 105 / min : from 69 . 8 + / - 26 . 2 to 81 . 9 + / - 28 . 2 w and 110 / min : from 73 . 6 + / - 28 . 9 to 90 . 4 + / - 29 . 4 w . the results demonstrate that physical performance in patients with cad was improved by our novel ambulatory cardiac rehabilitation program .    2.506421806499239
this improvement included an increase in maximum as well as endurance work capacity ; furthermore , this increase was accompanied by a decrease in resting and exercise heart rates .    2.6883743253433705
the results demonstrate an absolute increase of physical performance , more importantly an increase of physical performance at defined lactate levels in the presence of unchanged heart rates mediated by the rehabilitation program .    2.3766703606133355
thus , this increase was independent of motivational factors in the patients and / or the investigators during the re - exercise test .    2.8675504410541035
on the contrary , our data demonstrate that it is based on an improvement of aerobic endurance capacity associated with a therapeutically beneficial significant decrease of heart rate for a defined workload .    2.6676402244300546
the effects were independent of pharmacological influences ( e . g . , - receptor antagonists ) .    2.6580162413689985
these findings are of clinical importance with respect to reduction of myocardial oxygen consumption in patients with cad .    3.4342498961663552
newborn screening programs for inborn errors of metabolism are well established in industrialized countries .    2.3819406645857533
missed cases may be not only due to errors in specimen collection and laboratory errors but also to failures in adequate follow up .    2.0486856334205097
we report the case of a now 4 - year - old girl whose classical phenylketonuria was diagnostically missed in the course of follow - up procedures of a pathological screening result UNK µmol / l 17 , 6 mg % UNK .    2.2835660304530676
the separation of whole blood into components is the state - of - the - art in transfusion of allogeneic blood .    2.458804633189996
the main reasons are the negative effects of the buffy coat and the need for ffp .    2.6597909501619403
nevertheless , especially in germany whole blood is being rejected more and more even as autologous blood .    2.541577510714474
however , most of the negative effects of the buffy coat do not apply to autologous blood .    2.508512885793808
additionally , these patients usually do not develop coagulation disorders and therefore do not need plasma as a hemostatic component .    2.1691204676952887
on the other hand , separation into components of autologous blood leads to an increase of costs and to logistic problems that restrict autologous blood UNK to a few institutions .    2.2694099935221215
therefore , we have reviewed the literature in order to find a scientific basis for this .    3.132996217022021
we analysed all articles listed by medline during the last 12 years that dealt with the quality of whole blood or red cell concentrates .    2.5904304967222416
in addition , all references were included that contributed relevant information to the topic .    2.105995511580154
a total of 135 original articles , abstracts , reviews , letters or UNK were analysed that referred to standard preparations and storage media .    1.8842515552873844
in 48 papers the in vivo red cell survival was studied .    2.5310832938436807
the following in vitro parameters were also evaluated : ph , potassium load of the units , atp and dpg concentration of the red cells .    2.2068886428605827
whole blood ( UNK in cpda - 1 ) and red cell units ( stabilized in cpda - 1 or additive solutions ) with a different buffy coat or leucocyte content have comparable ph values and red cell 2 , 3 - dpg and atp concentrations at the end of the approved storage time .    2.1663762548356074
the potassium load of a whole blood unit appears to be higher than red cell concentrates , but this is to some extent caused by the higher plasma content of whole blood and is not thought to be a clinically relevant problem for patients receiving only a few units .    2.823932195010184
a number of studies demonstrate that dependent upon the leucocyte content of a red cell unit , leucocyte metabolites and enzymes are released and accumulate during storage .    1.9334938367947017
a detrimental influence on the integrity of the red cell membrane was found in several in vitro studies .    2.946497768478013
nevertheless , a significant improvement in red cell survival by leucocyte reduction was detected by only one group .    2.501208050479655
undoubtedly , non - hemolytic febrile transfusion reactions ( nhftr ) are generally caused by an antibody - antigen interaction due to the transfusion of allogeneic buffy coat .    2.4787277188505845
thus , these reactions are expected to occur in autologous blood transfusion .    2.4811897563425136
however , so far , there are no data about the frequency and severity of these reactions and whether they are more likely to emerge after transfusion of blood units with a particular preparation .    2.643182305252106
blood transfusions can cause septic complications due to bacterial contamination of the transfused units .    2.24896844861877
these fatal but rare complications may be reduced by pre - storage filtration of blood , but there is no indication that buffy coat reduction is effective .    2.39107737478101
three cases with septic complications have been reported after autologous transfusion , in two of which red cell concentrates ( at least one was free of buffy coat ) had been used .    2.6327943627901838
thus , there is no justification for the conclusion that the risk of septic complications is increased by transfusion of whole blood .    2.810745866730247
after all , whole blood and red cell concentrates exhibit only minor differences in relevant in vitro parameters .    2.312981847317546
hence , a higher incidence of adverse effects following the transfusion of autologous whole blood compared to autologous red cell concentrations is unlikely .    2.256066900336644
therefore , the 24 h in vivo recovery is considered to be the most valid criterion to assess the quality of red cell preparations .    2.6724557407416154
physical therapy can support geriatric rehabilitation in contributing to better health status , mobility , and quality of life .    2.358754041791316
however , the central focus of this contribution is not on illness - specific aspects of physical therapy but on power and stamina training .    2.115621910100839
these two training methods are of special importance for geriatric rehabilitation since most patients are admitted due to related problems and these two methods do imply specific risk factors for the rehabilitation process .    2.179169845898911
the spectrum of physical adaptation processes supported by power and stamina training is described and scientifically evaluated .    2.226856617923516
even in higher age groups positive training effects are possible .    2.2545347930721764
adequate usage of these training methods contributes to increased competence and a minimization of risks in daily life .    2.1229891036718356
the arthroscopic extraarticular bankart procedure tries to UNK the open bankart procedure .    2.7906680776707895
the extraarticular location of the implants makes a UNK capsular shift possible , if required .    2.3873156041770143
a total of 257 arthroscopic repairs following traumatic recurrent anterior shoulder dislocation have been carried out between 1992 and 1996 .    2.113298847638054
177 patients were treated only with UNK UNK device .    3.471078157426791
clinical and radiological follow up was possible in 165 patients .    2.83778006309833
postoperative complications : the recurrence rate was 9 , 7 % , allergic reactions representing a foreign body reaction to the synthetic material were seen in 5 cases ( 3 % ) and a frozen shoulder in 6 cases 3 , 6 % ) .    2.7608480070796095
61 % of the patients involved in UNK or contact sports returned to their preoperative sport activities .    3.0571263355756875
contrast - enhanced 3d mr angiography permits comprehensive assessment of the arterial system in the chest , abdomen und lower extremities .    2.55906698115529
the method combines intravenous bolus application of a non - nephrotoxic , paramagnetic , extracellular contrast agent with the acquisition of a fast 3d data set .    2.1963988692561145
high contrast between the vascular lumen and surrounding tissues , inherent three - UNK and the ability to collect image data in the chest and abdomen under apnea conditions all contribute to excellent image quality .    2.4055777256916775
contrast - enhanced 3d mra is being employed in many centers throughout the world for the evaluation of various arterial pathologies .    2.309156962864585
this review provides a technical overview and critically discusses the clinical applications in the chest , abdomen and lower extremities based upon the available literature and several UNK examples .    2.2192846332348277
the indications for magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) on prosthetic heart valve recipients remain critical .    2.2418657679913423
a generalized contraindication for mri is doubtful .    2.5453414089549256
some diagnostic questions such as interests in pathologies of the posterior cranial fossa , spinal abscesses , and internal derangements for the knee , strongly recommend the advantages of mri versus all other radiological diagnostic techniques .    2.150770534183768
mri can directly affect patients with prosthetic valves in three ways by : 1 ) movement or UNK of the prosthesis , 2 ) heating , and 3 ) arrhythmias induced by electric currents , and indirectly by distortion of the image and its subsequent misinterpretation .    2.2472978222914457
present literature that concerns the safety considerations of current values appears to be incomplete .    2.4271129759576167
therefore , a survey of twenty - five valve manufacturers with regard to compatibility , safety or contraindication for mri on their respective prosthetic heart valves was performed in 1998 .    2.5040259031951866
those manufacturers who UNK most of the valves in europe confirmed the safety of mri .    2.658322667599217
however , some gave their UNK based on inadequate data , or assigned all responsibility to the physician .    2.0860732495233743
some companies did not give any assurance for mri safety or failed to respond to our enquiry .    2.0511437145252525
two valve manufacturers UNK against performing mri on certain prostheses .    2.2044750779303697
based on our 1998 questionnaire , the technical issues , the clinical circumstances , the prerequisites and criteria for and the definition of safety standards for mri on prosthetic heart valve recipients are presented in this paper .    2.443897975179853
argyrophilic UNK disease ( agd ) is a frequently occurring degenerative illness of the aging human brain .    2.5127846132672595
it is accompanied by progressive pathological alterations of the UNK which are UNK to an abnormal phosphorylation of the UNK associated tau protein .    3.2483269267688755
histologically , it is possible with the help of suitable staining techniques to identify pathognomonic spindle - shaped cellular inclusions ( argyrophilic UNK ) .    2.3910702068721292
these cellular inclusions display a typical cortical as well as subcortical distribution pattern .    2.696728379244967
the goal of the present study is the retrospective evaluation of the clinical findings from 53 individuals with neuropathologically demonstrable agd - related changes of the brain .    3.014986028264422
nearly one - half of the cases ( 49 % ) was UNK as demented in accordance with dsm iv - criteria .    2.9060777536886095
moreover , the frequency of the dementia increased significantly in relation to the growing severity of the agd - associated pathological cytoskeletal degeneration .    2.485320212690027
these results confirm the assumption that agd can cause degenerative changes ranging from cognitive impairment all the way to dementia .    2.2225272999079104
they also underscore the necessity of further prospective studies pertaining to the clinical aspects of this still UNK disease .    2.570188181582539
the major problems in the treatment of open fractures with high blood loss are hypothermia acidosis and coagulopathy .    2.820481349079751
by improving the standards of polytrauma management and using massive transfusion systems , which should help to avoid those complications , the indication for primary limb salvage under hypovolemic shock conditions is greatly increased .    2.2848190035420473
the following case of an grade 3 open fracture of the femur with severe soft - tissue damage , including vascular lesions , with consecutive massive transfusion , should demonstrate that the cardiac - respiratory system can still be stabilized , even if a surgical solution seems impossible .    2.329126107774916
annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is mostly found in middle aged women in skin areas exposed to UNK .    2.053914899017162
our 17 - year - old female patient had a widespread reddish - brown lesion on the abdomen that met the histological criteria for annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma .    2.140266527312385
however , the clinical findings and the localization were uncommon .    3.023938663690671
uv light was excluded as a trigger .    2.79457196302904
other , still unknown , factors that might change UNK of elastic fibres must be considered .    2.326711317994903
spontaneous resolution suggests a transient influence of such factors .    2.365420273637476
traumatic instability of the sternoclavicular joint is a rare diagnosis .    3.4046454770014685
it is usually treated by different bandaging techniques without the possibility of early functional aftercare .    2.3578337997321177
in the period UNK 1 january 1996 and 31 december 1998 , a total of eight patients with unstable sternoclavicular joints requiring surgical treatment were treated with UNK plates .    2.7314667389027116
the population comprised UNK and one posterior dislocations .    2.549953618628301
a 81 - year - old man presented with massive hemoptysis and dyspnea .    2.439304945187611
results of chest radiography and computer tomography were highly suspicious for a large right - sided tumor of the bronchus with impression of the right main bronchus .    2.4201932178777685
because of clinical worsening the patient was transferred to our department of UNK .    2.977691250580085
the patient died of UNK hemoptysis the next day .    2.366194337183956
at autopsy we found a 2 - cm - diameter tumor of the proximal trachea as the source of massive bleeding and blood aspiration .    2.7654894751494714
histological examination confirmed the tumor to be an epithelioid angiosarcoma of the trachea , which was a primary as no other tumor manifestation was detected .    2.490570320771103
the entity of epithelioid angiosarcoma as a primary tumor of the trachea , to our knowledge , has not yet been reported .    2.7921545638714056
the benefits of epidural analgesia are well known , but it is not well understood which types of urologic surgery benefit most from epidural analgesia .    2.4018724104380933
in this study , the effects and side effects of prolonged epidural analgesia are prospectively examined and analysed on 172 adult patients in three different operation groups .    2.261443005443949
an epidural infusion of local anaesthetic combined with an opioid and adrenaline was given for a period of 5 - 7 days .    2.881803073985358
there was no difference between the groups with respect to the effectiveness of the analgesia and patients ' perception of the treatment .    3.0045038383209466
mobilization differed , as expected , between the groups , however even after the most major surgery ( e . g . cystectomy with bladder substitution ) , mobilization was UNK UNK .    2.269978756024699
retarded return of regular intestinal function after the transperitoneal operation and partly after lumbotomy compared with the extraperitoneal operation depended on which operation was performed and the amount of analgesia given .    2.279677499047612
the side effects such as sedation , nausea and UNK were UNK partly on the opiate and partly on the intervention .    2.6568416592371142
up to 11 % showed slight muscular weakness of the lower limbs as a specific side effect of the local anaesthetic .    2.8910588124370697
complications : one patient died of cerebral UNK due to an initially undetected subdural catheter placement complicated by severe pre - UNK carotid stenosis .    2.5157403351936516
in four patients , the epidural analgesia had to be stopped because of catheter migration .    2.893655811989148
there was no clinical evidence of hematoma , abscess or permanent neurological damage .    2.2121865626081294
epidural analgesia works well in terms of analgesia , mobilization and patient satisfaction , bearing in mind the potential side effects and complications .    2.528941673826847
it can be recommended for lumbotomy and long transperitoneal operations however not for extraperitoneal interventions in the lower abdomen such as radical prostatectomy .    2.2293771484422527
high - resolution computed tomography ( hrct ) provides excellent contrast between osseous structures , air and soft tissue in conjunction with high spatial resolution .    2.39454478578462
therefore , thin - section hrct with bone window setting is the method of choice for the examination of the middle ear structures .    2.5940773871266476
the indications are acute and chronic inflammatory changes , cholesteatoma and tumor , the " postoperative middle ear " , and malformations .    2.464526498813491
in most cases , hrct enables differentiation between inflammatory changes , cholesteatoma , and tumor .    2.1686841225981333
the excellent depiction of subtle osseous details enables the identification of erosions of the ossicles or of the bony walls of the mastoid cells , of osseous defects of the UNK , of the bony UNK , and of the tympanic course of the facial canal .    3.109921792152583
in addition , hrct enables excellent depiction of reconstructions of the ossicles or prosthesis of the ossicles .    2.2864722092271847
although hrct is the first method of choice , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) may provide additional information and lead to a more accurate diagnosis in some cases .    2.942288268930348
this is explained by the excellent soft tissue contrast provided by mri .    2.536860931895924
in addition , mri offers the possibility of using various pulse sequences and the administration of iv contrast material .    2.3983707803617507
therefore , mri may allow the differentiation between inflammatory changes , cholesteatoma , and tumor in those cases in which accurate diagnosis cannot be made by hrct .    2.3153276395207247
the differentiation between a UNK or UNK and other entities such as tumors or cholesteatoma can be established by mri .    2.5845361905598176
furthermore , mri can accurately depict cases of labyrinthitis or of neuritis of the facial nerve or of intracranial disease caused by middle ear processes , while this is not always possible by hrct .    2.0639194394436755
morbidity and mortality after emergency procedures in 105 patients with perforated colonic diverticulitis were evaluated in a retrospective study .    2.4183341442164994
in different stages of diverticulitis ( hinchey classification : i , 8 . 6 % ; ii , 14 . 3 % ; iii , 57 . 1 % ; iv , 20 . 0 % ) mortality was 12 . 4 % .    2.7738774245151583
preoperative sepsis syndrome with UNK and disturbed liver function , cardiac risk factors and obesity were independent prognostic factors in multiple logistic regression .    2.504739163291089
accompanied by immunosuppression the mortality rate remarkably increased to 33 % .    2.4435732524148
the stage of peritonitis showed no influence on the prognosis .    2.9131173222950904
in multivariate analysis , surgical procedure ( primary resection 12 . 4 % , hartmann ' s procedure 61 . 9 % , non - resection procedures 25 . 7 % ) showed influence only on increased general complications .    2.7350675567422766
the role of laparoscopic cholecystectomy on patients with histologically confirmed acute cholecystitis is still controversial .    2.5815794684219493
from january 1992 to december 1996 , 228 cholecystectomies were performed for acute cholecystitis and a total of 104 patients were operated on conventionally and 124 patients underwent laparoscopic surgery .    2.3080471732334917
in a prospective study we compared the conventional with the laparoscopic technique .    2.56053933395673
the results indicated that in 19 patients ( 15 . 3 % ) treated initially with the laparoscopic technique , a switch to laparotomy was required .    2.47641514804642
the operating duration was lower for conventional cholecystectomy ( 75 min versus 95 min ) .    2.1088375913817354
however , surgical and nonsurgical complication rates were similar in both groups .    2.4210202073819813
the period of hospitalization was shorter in laparoscopic operations .    2.767486363305242
according to these results we believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy in patients with acute cholecystitis is a safe and effective procedure .    2.8455632483880597
the patients will benefit from the advantages of laparoscopic surgery without increased morbidity .    2.73540002862384
the sentinel lymph node dissection ( slnd ) is one of the most striking developments in the treatment of melanoma .    3.0232951135441515
in 1992 , the method has been refined , and its use has increased .    2.4899902268790983
introduced as an alternative to elective lymph node dissection ( elnd ) , it has rapidly made its way into clinical practice .    2.646077440269717
slnd allows precise pathologic staging through removal and analysis of a limited number of nodes ( false - negative rate < 2 % ) .    2.1563552582617787
it distinguishes patients with clinically occult nodal disease from those with tumor - free regional basin who would not benefit from radical dissection .    2.2249662136024186
however , the slnd is still an experimental procedure with yet unproven utility .    2.1835711571227705
although children are injured everyday through accidents , road traffic , leisure or sports activities , internal lesions of the knee joint due to the trauma are rare .    2.455633656062229
diagnose and therapy follow rather empirical than analytical patterns .    2.2541500956863483
traumatic internal lesions of the knee where analysed in 76 children up to age 16 .    2.7574575502003476
the pattern of injury changed with increasing age , the trauma remaining the same .    2.5246214567463587
most common where injuries to the anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) .    2.5988112961273777
main cause where sports activities .    2.603624390652214
operative treatment seems to be the appropriate treatment .    3.7005613098580157
osseous avulsions of the UNK and collateral ligaments showed good results after transosseous refixation with a suture .    2.751189753875587
suturing of intraligamentous acl - ruptures as well as patellar ligaments plasty showed unsatisfactory results .    2.4675643495804165
secondary lesions due to instability of the knee where also observed in children .    3.025929814977366
children cannot self estimate the severity of the injury so subjective statements are UNK .    2.511562167016152
trauma , surgery , pain and immobilisation cause a marked malfunction of the UNK - motor system which is effectively treated by physiotherapy .    2.6194180920302443
malignant mixed müllerian tumours ( mmmt ) are tumours of the female genital tract which rarely occur in extragenital sites .    2.06933607658517
we report a case of a 46 - year - old female with mmmt with primary occurrence in the greater omentum .    2.3699371710700032
only 19 cases of primary extragenital manifestation of this tumour are described in the literature .    2.57834263356267
the clinical appearance , diagnosis , therapy , histological evaluation and histogenesis are discussed .    2.4381125414145006
the publication of the UNK statement was aimed at the improvement of the quality of research reports of randomized controlled clinical trials .    3.210937240869102
it contains the most important standards of high quality research .    3.086903201272625
the demand for minimally invasive techniques and more comfort for the patient is becoming higher and higher .    2.828698618035489
in the region of the ankle joint , it is therefore ideal to use the UNK for pathology .    3.428270617937596
indications for ankle joint arthroscopy are : soft tissue impingement , ligament instability , impingement in the UNK , osteochondral lesions , loose bodies , arthrosis , and loose os UNK of the talus .    2.5135487450847167
in the subtalar joint the indications are rupture of the ligaments , loose bodies , and synovitis with soft tissue impingement .    2.495707091066098
a new indication is arthroscopically assisted arthrodesis of the talar and subtalar joint .    2.257387686484265
the reported high incidence of complications , especially in terms of neurovascular lesions , can be avoided by an exact knowledge of anatomy and use of non - invasive distraction of the joint .    3.369029344132638
although alexithymia is found in patients with various somatic disorders , it remains unclear whether it is really related to organic disease - as proposed by the founders of the concept . [ 125 ] .    2.4591595988165147
as the interplay between the experience of emotion and possible adverse effects on health is a fundamental UNK of psychosomatic medicine , alexithymia remains an interesting concept to be further explored , especially concerning ( 1 ) possible pathways linking emotion to physical illness and ( 2 ) the UNK basis of emotional information processing .    2.1751309026559036
compared to the intense international discussion on the subject , in germany there are still many doubts concerning alexithymia : while some clinicians question the validity of the whole concept , psychiatric and psychosomatic researchers seem UNK about alexithymia ' s role in their search for a physiological basis to the link between emotion and physical disease .    2.108664452633374
our review deals with the empirical literature concerning that possible association and tries to UNK in their data with modern , UNK founded insights into emotional information processing within the brain .    2.0769337458789767
in the etiopathology of tension type headache , vascular and autonomic disorders are discussed .    2.1615933524770883
fifteen patients with chronic tension type headache according to the criteria of the ihs were investigated using the tcd - ergometer - test - a method used to evaluate the UNK mechanism of cerebrovascular autoregulation - and the results were compared with the findings in fifteen healthy control subjects .    2.5768479355065663
an immunohistochemical and morphometric study was performed on bone marrow biopsies in 604 patients with chronic UNK leukemia ( cml ) to compare morphological and clinical features and to evaluate effects of interferon ( ifn ) and chemotherapy .    2.448077659182694
following morphometry significant correlations were calculated between number of UNK + megakaryocytes , including their precursors with fiber density .    2.2640171091135755
this finding is in line with the close functional relationship between megakaryopoiesis and fibroblasts regarding the complex pathomechanism of myelofibrosis .    2.0044554135169044
the latter was observed in about 28 % of patients already at diagnosis .    3.0562824307122916
in a similar way , the frequency of cd68 + macrophages was correlated with the amount of UNK + nucleated UNK precursors , UNK an involvement of this cell lineage in iron turnover , hemoglobin synthesis , and degradation of the expelled nuclei from UNK .    2.190738331220863
the ( - d - UNK residue - expressing ) pseudo - UNK cells were detectable in 30 % of pretreatment specimens .    2.4182915074116154
moreover , significant associations were calculable between reduction in erythropoiesis or increase in fibers with clinical features such as hemoglobin level , percentages of myelo - and erythroblasts in the peripheral blood , and spleen size .    1.8843629570214628
based on our morphometric evaluations , a classification into three different histological subgroups : granulocytic , megakaryocytic , and myelofibrotic was carried out .    1.9367358522743732
this simplified staging system was correlated with corresponding sets of hematological data .    2.2209327498403963
sequential biopsies in 173 patients with monotherapy by ifn , hydroxyurea ( hu ) , or UNK ( UNK ) revealed a fibrogenic effect of ifn in contrast to a fiber - reducing property of hu .    2.415455799314807
the dynamics of myelofibrosis and changes of major cell lineages during treatment were readily demonstrable by calculating corresponding indices .    2.054918012138681
thus , in patients with complete hematological remission following ifn administration , regeneration of erythropoiesis was found to be accompanied by an increase in the total number of cd68 + macrophages , including activated subpopulations .    2.590484358233618
histological subgroups showed a transition from a ( UNK ) granulocytic and megakaryocyte pattern to the myelofibrotic subtype in about 40 % of patients .    2.518695994824583
this change was opposed to a numerical reduction in the myelofibrotic subtype which occurred in 17 patients ( 36 % ) , but predominantly in those under hu therapy .    2.643525713788043
in conclusion , the striking heterogeneity of bone marrow features in cml warrants a careful morphological evaluation of UNK biopsies and appropriate means of processing to achieve relevant correlations with clinical data and , thus , allows a more elaborate insight into the dynamics of the disease process .    2.2709528519538744
computer - aided analysis of the results of the intrathecal infusion test using our mathematical UNK leads to simplification of this investigation , and therefore normal pressure hydrocephalus is more easily diagnosed .    2.6124182592953393
simultaneous measurement of resistance and compliance during a single investigation allows the exertion of the patients to be minimized .    2.6140056437243415
in contrast to classic methods it is not necessary that the icp reaches a plateau .    2.52194828374225
our mathematical method UNK with the description of a pressure - dependent slope of the function for the resistance from the static examination models .    2.461653687381808
for that we are able to take the non - UNK of the cerebrospinal fluid resorption into consideration .    3.3508074211436267
primary medullary nailing of femoral fractures is UNK by the risk of central and pulmonary complications in patients with polytrauma , especially in conjunction with UNK or thoracic trauma .    3.4399696144557885
this also applies to unreamed medullary nailing .    2.3463748880898163
primary treatment with external fixation necessitates secondary surgery with an altered procedure , the timing of which is not predictable .    2.521468368754579
plate osteosynthesis with anatomical repositioning of the fragments and rigid fixation is a technically demanding procedure , but can lead to fragment necrosis due to fragment denudation .    2.5081609794956536
in a prospective study conducted from 1 september 1994 to 30 june 1996 on 17 polytraumatized patients ( average iss : 30 points ) , simple femoral stem fractures ( a - 1 to b - 3 of the ao - classification ) were stabilized by elastic plate osteosynthesis using biological technique .    2.043724779966856
while cautiously preserving the periosteal and muscle connections to the bone , a plate is inserted as a bridge without any interfragmentary compression .    2.001261371192524
at least two to four holes are left free in the center of the plate .    2.409157428463487
this allows micro - movements in the fracture gap without the risk of material fatigue .    2.6318248650863545
all of the fractures were immediately stabilized on the day of the accident .    2.70098196069698
ornithine UNK deficiency is an x - linked disorder of the urea - cycle .    2.538422221347416
with a prevalance of 1 : 14000 it is one of the most frequent inborn errors of metabolism .    2.444462490725108
heterozygous females exposed to high protein nutrition or protein UNK , are faced with highly detrimental effects UNK their lives .    2.171415084983617
coumarin necrosis is a rare , but life - threatening complication when administering coumarin in oral anticoagulant therapy .    2.5031439972386025
UNK areas are the breasts , hips , gluteal region , thighs or lower legs .    2.013037242828776
thrombotic tendencies , such as congenital or acquired changes in coagulation , lead to a higher risk of coumarin necrosis .    2.928443824446939
a direct , toxic effect of coumarin on the capillary system may also play a role .    2.267955113904189
although the incidence is only 0 . 01 - 0 . 1 % , lethality lies at 15 % , the knowledge of this rare complication is important in order to begin with a proper treatment UNK .    3.1810213355586834
the therapy of choice is early fibrinolysis .    2.630140914985861
with special emphasis on pediatric aspects , the presently available data on the effectiveness and safety or specific immunotherapy with house dust UNK extracts are reviewed .    2.309329995062599
in addition to antiinflammatory treatment and allergen avoidance , specific immunotherapy offers an approach to the treatment of bronchial asthma in those patients sensitized against house dust mites .    2.339386648785858
controlled studies of specific immunotherapy against house dust mites show decreased symptom - medication scores and positiv effects on some lung function parameters .    1.926769624608511
therapeutic efficacy appears to be better in pediatric patients .    3.2875401636591532
severe side effects seem to be rare , but are more common in patients with chronic airway obstruction , in infants and with UNK - immunotherapy .    3.5506867607102994
from january 1996 UNK february 1997 6 , UNK patients were treated by our group with ptca and 3 , UNK ( 60 . 5 % ) received one or several stents .    2.7868688745366645
an angiographic follow up was achieved in 63 % of the patients with 1 , UNK experiencing restenosis ( 32 . 8 % ) .    3.045491936421697
of those UNK treated with re - ptca 302 were randomly selected for further analysis .    2.2586296627623654
225 patients ( 74 . 4 % ) of this UNK were treated with UNK only .    3.775209700430397
it is not clear whether public health insurance will cover post exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) , whereby the question of costs being covered by private health insurance companies is not taken into consideration here .    2.174730011527339
regulations concerning prevention ( § 20 sgb v ) , precautionary medical services ( § 23 sgb v ) and health examination ( § 25 UNK v ) offer no legal basis for cost coverage .    2.0046893987828414
pep is patient care in the sense of § 27 sgb v . however , this particular treatment has not yet been adapted into public health insurance financial guidelines because the federal committees have not yet made appropriate recommendations .    2.1947049109713874
the principles of the so called " new methods of examination and treatment " legal construct may support cost coverage liability .    2.264157621213362
if a doctor , in the case of an indication according to the german - austrian recommendations , does not prescribe pep , this would probably not be malpractice , because there are still many scientific questions to be answered .    2.6810009827014896
to clarify the functional mechanism of the esmarch device in the treatment of sleep apnea , its effect on muscle activity during sleep was studied UNK with and without the appliance at the inferior head of the lateral pterygoid muscle , the genioglossal muscle , and the UNK muscle in 15 patients with sleep apnea syndrome .    2.707415437880425
during the obstructive apnea the muscles showed significantly lower amplitudes than before the apnea .    2.1192949828774865
no significant decrease in the amplitude was observed during the central apnea , but , after the obstructive and central apnea , significantly higher amplitudes were seen than beforehand .    2.2632515022260944
the amplitudes rose after the placement of the appliance , and the amplitudes of the genioglossal and lateral pterygoid muscles during obstructive apnea increased significantly after the insertion of the appliance .    2.437633502165024
the results suggest that the device can activate the masticatory and tongue muscle activity and indicate that the muscles activated with the appliance can prevent obstruction in the oropharynx .    2.1099031039495837
the esmarch device not only helps avoid obstruction by mandibular UNK , but also affects function by UNK the muscles .    2.476041390434092
the analysis of the UNK UNK disordered UNK into a hospital order institution reveals a lot of very conscious and well organized behavior during the criminal activity .    2.5286158736528996
this must be taken into account in therapy and prognosis .    2.7999764920126986
the prevalence in paediatric obesity is increasing in many UNK and developing countries and growing to a world - wide medical and socio - economic problem .    2.026181046066989
in a recent report of the who the world - wide epidemic of obesity was addressed as a problem of highest priority .    2.2576027122797497
despite advances in the field of orthopedic surgery , necrosis of the femoral head still remains a serious problem .    2.8451146939286778
under normal conditions magnetic resonance tomography ( mrt ) is the gold standard for early diagnosis .    2.7829065977390375
because of magnetic interference , this technique is not applicable in the diagnosis of posttraumatic necrosis with internal fixation , however .    2.673775967596871
this seems to be an ideal indication for ossovenography : contrast medium is injected into the femoral head under x - ray control and the venous flow is documented .    2.6849642483286114
furthermore , it is possible to get histological samples from suspicious areas .    2.488942002761799
in one patient in whom physiological flow was found , there was a corresponding absence of necrosis in the histological sample .    2.5461280040774024
there were no complications during ossovenography .    2.440223719398441
however , the prediction of malignant arrhythmic events cannot be performed with sufficient accuracy .    2.4877019917090677
for a better identification of high risk patients other methods are necessary .    2.758324615786367
in this study the impact of the UNK for the prediction of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was investigated .    3.663193302286182
the results of a retrospective study concerning percutaneous catheter drainage of 62 intra - abdominal abscesses in 60 patients were demonstrated , including the procedure and complications .    2.556459835024515
for the first access a thin needle was used to perform an aspiration biopsy under sonographic control .    2.354217161522506
we placed a UNK or UNK UNK catheter by UNK or trocar technique into the abscesses .    2.484726744422327
the primary success rate of percutaneous drainage was 85 % .    2.6629575270378476
complications occurred in 6 . 4 % of the cases with a mortality of 0 % .    3.682779421589669
this method is an acceptable alternative to surgery for many patients .    2.490073057925613
ultrasound - guided percutaneous catheter drainage is the method of choice for uncomplicated abscesses , especially in the critically ill patient .    2.7189310087759377
acute brain tissue damage or systemic illnesses can lead to local or diffuse brain edema and raised intracranial pressure ( icp ) .    2.3386264515504496
it is obvious that in all brain injuries additional factors ( metabolic disturbances , hypoxia and hypercapnia , circulatory instability ) UNK brain edema and UNK recovery of viable neurons have to be treated immediately and consequently .    2.0858711183957204
medical therapies for further treatment of elevated icp depend not only on their mode of action and side effects but although on the specific illness .    2.449056290551839
the different etiology and pathogenesis of developing brain edema and icp elevation with either more local or generalized extension explain the different success of medical treatment strategies in severe head trauma compared to middle cerebral artery UNK or complete hemispheric infarction .    2.0954809826232133
an algorithm for treatment of postischemic brain edema in acute hemispheric infarction was developed .    2.5363955529690916
however , UNK et al .    2.445156229722535
found that changing circuits ( including UNK and exhalation valve and the attached UNK ) every 24 h rather than every 48 h was independently associated with the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia .    2.1850296448146485
on the basis of these results and recent studies , the current situation in the literature was analyzed in order to make recommendations for exchanging ventilator circuits .    2.8756992284316842
the key function of the uterine cervix to maintain pregnancy is biochemically characterized by an increased synthesis of proteins ( e . g . , collagen ) , proteoglycans , and glycoproteins ( e . g . , fibronectin ) as well as by well - defined interactions between these components of the extracellular matrix .    2.405236618915942
in contrast to the slow phase of the cervical UNK process in late pregnancy , dilatation of the cervix during parturition requires the rapid formation and action of catabolic enzyme systems , leading mainly to collagen degradation and changes in its architecture but also to degradation of other fundamental matrix proteins .    2.049227862879888
it has been suggested that an increased production of tumor necrosis factor - and interleukin - 1 , for example , induces an increased expression of endothelial adhesion molecules with subsequent extravasation of granulocytes in the cervical stroma and that the UNK and degranulation of these cells within the stroma is triggered by an increase in interleukin - 8 concentration .    2.421517920871771
the proteases ( e . g . , matrix metalloproteinase - 8 ) released after degranulation of neutrophilic granulocytes encounter an already UNK ( loss of UNK ) collagenous fiber network .    2.093143901713449
the clinical consequences of this basic research is to develop new concepts in a more causal treatment of cervical pathology during pregnancy and parturition .    2.3034454578528365
objectives : the involvement of cytokines in degeneration and inflammation of human tissue is well established .    2.4235906947193233
interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) is a major agent in the pathophysiology of periarticular bone resorption in rheumatoid arthritis and in osteoporosis .    2.940017688421754
because the use of recombinant cytokines and growth factors is limited due to their short half lives , techniques are needed to get a permanent release of these therapeutic proteins .    2.543839554350438
the rational of this study was to show that retroviral transduction of human osteoblastic cells is possible in vitro using the marker gene lacz and the potentially therapeutic gene encoding for human interleukin - 1 receptor antagonist protein ( il - 1ra ) .    2.227173957657054
different transduction techniques were combined to improve the rate of transduction in vitro .    3.0771455471190468
methods : osteoblastic cells were isolated from human UNK bone and cultured in vitro .    2.2971436973794033
the - galactosidase ( lacz ) gene and the cdna of il - 1ra were introduced into the isolated cells by UNK mediated gene transfer .    2.2106808604406054
lacz activity was determined by UNK staining , il - 1ra was measured quantitatively by elisa .    2.5399192453699206
results : the transfer of retroviral il - 1ra led to il - 1ra expression of UNK to UNK irap / UNK cells / 48h .    2.3718921355722014
by combining different techniques to improve transduction , the x - UNK staining established a rate of transduction of 60 % .    2.415759149628119
conclusion : our results demonstrate that retroviral transduction of human UNK cells is possible in vitro , and leads to high levels of the synthesized UNK product .    2.4342870916317687
the rate of retroviral transduction can be accelerated in vitro .    2.3520549418224577
to provide a brief review of the current state of topical treatment with UNK or acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) for therapy of chronic pain syndromes .    2.9770860311241116
we report a 72 - year - old patient who developed an isolated bilateral hypoglossal nerve paralysis following head trauma with complete recovery after three months .    2.202820503355473
since the ct scan did not show any fractures of the posterior skull base , we discuss a traction nerve injury as a possible mechanism .    2.650347596432106
injuries of the colon and retroperitoneum are rarely observed after blunt abdominal trauma and occur in about 5 - 20 % of the patients .    2.5619343754810964
the majority of complications are due to initial misdiagnoses and a delay in treatment .    2.4362359936575833
lesions of the pancreas and duodenum are the most frequent diagnoses in the retroperitoneal space , while major vascular traumata or urogenital injuries are rare .    2.505691943368901
retroperitoneal hematoma are most likely due to pelvic fractures .    2.6770443475616155
the survival of patients after colon or retroperitoneal injuries depends on the severity of concomitant organ trauma , the time of diagnosis , and a situation - adapted therapeutic strategy .    2.9433135117913625
the treatment of the typical caudal retroperitoneal hematoma following pelvic fractures is conservative in most patients .    2.2735981048045515
early pelvic stabilization , e . g . , with external fixation , is recommended in these patients .    2.7729643697968305
central retroperitoneal hematoma in the supra - or UNK space should be treated surgically , as major vascular injuries are most likely in these patients .    2.392639678175378
the treatment of colon injuries depends on the degree of peritonitis and the severity of concomitant trauma .    2.927114431441251
early diagnosed injuries are suitable for primary repair , while deviation UNK or a hartmann procedure with or without resection should be offered to patients with delayed diagnoses , peritonitis , or severe concomitant diseases .    2.3139615439818604
long - lasting procedures should be abandoned in the emergency situation ; in these severe cases , laparotomy should be aimed towards primary " damage control " and followed by definite surgery after stabilization of the patient .    2.2623240251297534
surgery of the great veins inevitably began with the surgical treatment of injuries , often involving the femoral vein .    2.767857836420345
because of the famous case presented by roux in 1813 , the prevailing opinion until almost the end of the nineteenth century was that ligation of the vein made death inevitable , but that the only way to control severe hemorrhaging from a vein was to UNK the femoral artery .    2.0926457129937175
UNK ' s principle ( UNK ) consisted in the ligation and resection of great veins of the body and limbs in order to prevent sepsis in suppurative processes .    2.8574189903284335
this surgical method was still being used in the first half of the twentieth century in patients with perforated appendicitis or puerperal fever .    3.0555149913323163
in the limb , the congestion induced in the vein had a UNK effect on the healing process .    2.6173892383574375
the surgical treatment of leg and pelvic deep vein thrombosis was initially ( UNK ) aimed at achieving decompression in compartment UNK .    2.6015116835136776
the first thrombectomy was performed in 1937 , but several operations with a successful outcome were reported at the UNK annual meeting of the german society of surgery in the following year .    2.9406811209847294
bilateral glomus jugulare tumors are rare .    2.704004517898113
however , their treatment should preserve not only the function of the facial nerve but also the caudal cranial nerves and the middle ears in order to avoid bilateral hearing losses .    2.5584536266275353
further , venous cerebral drainage has to be ensured in order to avoid cerebral hypertension and hemorrhagic infarction after bilateral jugular UNK .    2.475880743575089
in the case presented bilateral glomus jugulare tumors required super - selective angiography and embolization .    2.0993125975915277
complete tumor removal on both sides was then possible by a transmastoid - transcervical approach without any further functional UNK .    2.1169414477938058
middle ear function was preserved on both sides by temporary ventral translocation of the posterior wall of the auditory meatus .    2.5075360714981993
as the sigmoid sinus and internal jugular vein had been ligated during initial previous surgery , venous drainage was tested one year later by angiography and compression of the remaining internal jugular vein .    2.1697473054278036
a sufficient collateral circulation was found and permitted surgery on the second side .    2.3210584094130082
intoxication is the UNK reaction of the cns to UNK psychoactive substances .    2.706197188761345
intoxication - like conditions may also occur without taking drugs .    2.51376914716665
we then use the term " ecstasy " .    2.700014902611342
intoxication can follow typical or atypical course .    2.389242609671381
the main symptoms are disturbances of consciousness and orientation and additionally changes of mood , affect , drive and initiative , train of thought and self - control .    2.0133218529913774
the diagnosis of intoxication differs from the diagnosis of psychosis because the latter continues its own course , occurs in the absence of psychoactive substances in the organism and always lasts longer than an intoxication .    2.2352528546609483
in a meta - analysis of 69 prospective and retrospective studies , we investigated the value of various surgical techniques in the treatment of lumbar disk herniations .    2.905107802436605
UNK hair loss is the most frequent reason for the topical application of hair - growth - promoting agents .    2.830798139631977
such preparations should arrest or even reverse androgen - induced hair follicle regression as well as prolonging the hair cycles , especially of the shortened anagen phase , and thus protect from increased hair loss .    2.185045225789487
true evidence of drug effects on hair growth is problematic , since UNK , the method UNK applied by the manufacturers , fail to reveal every factor involved in the follicular activity , especially the duration of anagen stage .    2.5918905804728753
for example , an increase in the anagen rate does not always reflect a lengthening of the anagen stage , but may also be due to shortened hair cycles .    2.6612859105592994
accordingly , drug effects on hair growth should be investigated by methods that analyse the cell cycle kinetics .    2.237573302600408
for this approach dna - UNK of the outer root sheath in UNK anagen hairs and of complete anagen hair UNK taken by UNK techniques from scalp biopsies offers a reproducible method for quick and reliable evaluation of hair growth .    2.01023956365139
the calcaneus pseudathrosis is UNK seen in clinical workday and we UNK find any case be reported .    2.0496466113158793
in two UNK the authors present the diagnosis and therapie of a non - union after a calcaneus fracture .    2.669592426203301
the authors point especially at anatomical characteristics and biomechanical reasons and their meaning for aetiology of pseudathrosis after a calcaneus fracture .    1.8532551980988805
a general review of the results and technique of intraarterial chemotherapy in cases of breast cancer is given .    3.5141291702071626
the remission rate for untreated primary tumors is nearly 100 % , for completely treated local relapses approximately 70 % .    2.2502674147983246
the complication rate is quite low using an intraarterial well - tolerated cytostatic agent such as mitoxantrone .    2.0704448257102737
however , thromboembolism of the vertebral artery UNK the internal mammary artery may occur .    2.4316821928190744
the indication for intraarterial chemotherapy should always be set by an interdisciplinary board .    2.416982582190084
in the country city of UNK , germany all cases of varicella - zoster virus infection seen by dermatologists , pediatricians and general UNK were registered over a period of 16 months , from february 1992 until may 1993 .    2.2287245847767556
152 patients were clinically diagnosed with herpes zoster and UNK patients with chickenpox .    2.7066283105809195
the population - based incidence of zoster infections was 22 . 6 per 10 , 000 inhabitants per year , while the incidence of chickenpox was 42 . 4 .    2.6223890660243954
there was a slight predominance of male patients with zoster .    2.506722798469702
zoster was seen in patients of all ages but there was a clear predominance in older patients .    3.070788593992
the peak of the disease occurred in the eighth decade .    3.1293804989957974
in patients with chickenpox , the sex ratio was equal .    2.5342603467933658
the disease typically occurs in children and we observed a predominance of the cases in the first decade .    3.294405591261507
paraneoplastic neurologic syndromes ( pns ) are rare disorders of the nervous system that cannot be ascribed to UNK or to destruction of vital systemic organs by the tumor or its treatment .    2.396744451868384
most frequently , pns occur in association with small - cell lung , breast or ovarian carcinomas .    2.267291644943414
the most frequent pns is lambert - eaton myasthenic syndrome , which at the same time has the highest predictive value concerning an underlying carcinoma .    2.104388982331275
pns have been classified mostly under anatomical aspects but now are increasingly categorized according to specific antibodies .    2.0817651131000074
in certain neurologic syndromes ( sensible and autonomic neuropathy , UNK , limbic encephalitis , UNK - myoclonus syndrome , stiff - man syndrome , neuromyotonia , subacute amaurosis ) specific autoantibodies are highly predictive for a neoplasm .    2.202085256640407
pathogenic relevance of these autoantibodies has been demonstrated only for antibodies against ( 1 ) voltage gated calcium channels ( UNK ) in lambert - eaton myasthenic syndrome , ( 2 ) voltage gated potassium channels ( UNK ) in neuromyotonia , and ( 3 ) UNK in cancer associated retinopathy .    2.645070451105379
the present article deals with the neurological symptoms of pns , associated tumors , and the relevance of specific antibodies for the diagnosis and pathogenesis of pns .    2.943391561102541
ewing ' s sarcoma is a very rare tumor which has , however , attracted much oncological interest since the dramatic improvement of its prognosis under chemotherapy .    2.369603040731655
its histogenesis has been discussed controversially for a long time , including a possible origin in immature UNK , UNK , endothelial and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells .    2.694301215801296
repeated reports have also suggested a possible neuroectodermal genesis .    2.387675962589395
convincing arguments , however , have only been brought forward during recent years , since it was found that ewing ' s sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor share a common chromosome translocation 11 ; 22 .    2.367070176942419
in the meantime this hypothesis has been strengthened by numerous cell biological analyses .    2.1283832295247564
there seems to be no clear border between ewing ' s sarcoma and malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumors with definite neural differentiation .    2.212897372973208
histological differential diagnosis of ewing ' s sarcoma has been improved by immunohistological methods .    2.57707609256773
in most cases , they can be distinguished from lymphoma ( leucocyte common antigen , b and t markers ) and embryonal UNK ( muscle specific actin , desmin ) without problems .    2.0723062213071106
apart from that , it is possible nowadays to obtain antibodies against the mic 2 - protein , which is preferably expressed in ewing sarcoma .    2.55045517166248
the diagnostics of ewing ' s sarcoma and the malignant peripheral neuroectodermal tumor have considerably been enriched by the fact that the specific chromosome translocation t ( 11 ; 22 ) can be proved molecular biologically .    2.2051768431797294
in contrast to the cytogenetic evidence , it is not necessary to establish cell cultures .    2.8377358171320406
contrast enhanced ( ce ) magnetic resonance angiography UNK angiographic depiction of extended vascular territories with high quality and diagnostic value .    1.9923666481269962
a prerequisite is the fast acquisition of a three - dimensional gradient - echo data set during the injection of a bolus of a t1 - shortening contrast agent .    2.2222764542303652
we describe the dependence of the quality of ce - mra on technical parameters of different mr - scanners and consider some fundamental facts and practical guidelines concerning the contrast agent injection .    2.0280180977116604
the present study gives a survey of radiological findings after surgical treatment of laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinomas , whereby the surgical procedures and the localisation of tumours found special consideration .    2.4380670379811784
owing to advances in adjuvant therapy , the outlook for patients with primary malignant bone tumors has improved dramatically in recent decades .    2.614581859216223
this applies both to improved survival and to increased limb salvage rates .    2.2908833465305816
the diagnostic strategies and a staging system for malignant bone tumors are outlined .    2.5998767600318113
technical aspects of the standard limb salvage procedures , such as UNK - UNK resection at the shoulder , internal UNK , proximal and distal femur resection and rotation plasty are presented .    2.713962191893951
the use of soft tissue procedures such as flaps and the use of modular implant systems has reduced the complication rates of limb salvage procedures .    2.5895342132717754
in the future we hope to further improve prognosis and quality of life for such patients by the application of risk - adapted strategies for chemotherapy and surgery .    2.5973026309651153
in 10 - 30 % of cases , locoregional recurrence is accompanied by distant metastasis ; a further 25 % develop distant metastasis within the year after diagnosis of recurrence .    2.3910659931125955
in treatment of recurrent tumor in the thoracic wall , axillary or UNK disease surgery plays a major role .    2.7623937068501694
since - another long - lasting courses occur even in the metastatic situation , recurrence is not an infrequent event , and therapy then needs a multidisciplinary approach .    2.2924416339312175
surgical techniques such as local , myocutaneous or UNK flaps and mesh graft transplantation are used to cover large defects after tumor resection .    2.2570079635427582
additional and innovative modalities are combined in the management of this complex problem : locoregional or systemic chemotherapy , topical application of chemotherapy , certain radiation regimens and in otherwise resistant tumors the experimental use of photodynamic laser therapy ( pdt ) .    2.07233334663098
the most important goal hereby is to restore or at least maintain organ function and quality of life .    2.350994237216475
in acute osteomyelitis of childhood a rapid diagnosis and initiation of antibiotic therapy is necessary in order to prevent late sequelae .    2.615350150452585
thus , diagnostic imaging plays a crucial role .    2.4538444455457773
if acute osteomyelitis is suspected in a child , imaging starts with conventional radiography in order to exclude other differential diagnoses .    2.472956614509852
this is followed by sonography for the purpose of diagnosing a subperiosteal abscess or joint fluid from which the causative organism could be isolated .    2.132277587922181
mri is superior to bone scan in UNK the exact anatomy , which is extremely important in spinal osteomyelitis and preoperatively .    2.8277892149740476
the bone scan can show the whole skeleton in one examination and should be favored if there is no definite localization or in suspected multifocal osteomyelitis .    2.266551957006785
rarely scintigraphy with UNK white blood cells is indicated .    2.5132793140275713
the different imaging modalities are described in detail and an imaging diagnostic workup is outlined .    2.4924813620397788
in spite of all interdisciplinary efforts and functionally oriented operation procedures , there are still unsatisfying results in the treatment of cleft lip and palate ( clp ) patients .    2.485428375021173
in some cases , it is necessary to reposition the complete maxilla .    2.8999188975007524
finally , there are indications for speech improving measures and total UNK .    2.6696679048816927
dental treatment can be brought to a positive end by means of implant - borne UNK work .    2.8119839228111982
in this paper , some of the anatomical and physiologic conditions and surgical procedures are described , which may serve as a basis for a functionally orientated treatment of sequelae after primary clp care .    2.6970311380370156
damage to the respiratory system caused by inhalation of toxic products of UNK and the subsequent development of adult respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) are the main lethal factors in UNK patients .    2.7873359871676047
treatment with exogenous surfactant is one of the therapeutic options .    3.3142470348413275
however , no clinical reports have yet been published about this therapy .    2.350895577020697
we report on two patients with burn injuries of second to third degree affecting 42 % and 48 % respectively of the total body surface plus inhalation injury complicated by ards .    1.8870425469696037
both patients were treated with bovine surfactant ( UNK ) .    3.0596331187439474
the therapeutic effects on oxygenation and pulmonary function were monitored .    2.5185434390519674
intrabronchial application of surfactant by bronchoscopy during exhaustive conventional mechanical ventilation resulted in improved gas exchange with an increase in arterial o2 pressure ( pao2 ) ; inspired o2 concentration ( fio2 ) was lowered and there was an improvement in lung compliance .    2.1181560901193084
both patients survived this critical situation .    2.4924173545871002
we conclude that treatment with exogenous surfactant in UNK victims with ards is a promising therapeutic approach to improve the survival rate of these high - risk patients .    2.4937419355584516
the main aesthetic concern of patients with angle class ii deformities with skeletal deep bite - short face syndrome - is the short lower face .    2.174868944469154
it is the orthodontist ' s task to correct this deformity insofar as possible .    2.045769923066592
depending on the extent , even UNK at the beginning of their training will recognize this .    2.662144665854612
since presurgical orthodontic treatment determines the kind and extent of the surgical procedure , the orthodontist has to plan the treatment in for individual case .    2.4571855933354514
it is the purpose of this article to demonstrate a concept of treatment for patients with class ii deformities , skeletal deep bite , and a short lower face .    2.9000982681321688
the treatment results show that it is necessary to leave or to create a certain curve of UNK , depending on the extent of the deformity , to achieve a satisfactory result in terms of to function , aesthetics , and stability .    2.923587739638728
it can be concluded that it is only possible to reach the preset treatment goals with an exact diagnosis and the knowledge of the necessary preparation in combination with the surgical procedure .    2.973471679815293
adequate psychotherapeutic treatment of transsexual patients during the " real - life - test " is crucial for the outcome after sex reassignement surgery .    2.2723240565808265
necessary modifications are discussed along the concept of " transsexual defense " and the interrelation of identity and disordered gender identity .    2.207438608585075
usually UNK of transsexual patients , who decide over somatic sex reassignement , have to UNK also in psychotherapy in a broad sense .    2.4321628341516472
within the setting of the " administrative - psychotherapeutic split " the psychotherapist leaves the decision over admission to sex reassignement to a therapist specialised in gender identity disorders .    1.9789739832453648
in this setting patients have more time to develop insight and have better chances to explore other options and find individual solutions with regard to irreversible sex reassignement surgery .    2.012710143539752
during recent years in the german federal social welfare system has been subject to several changes due to structural forms .    2.4446842689460078
the hospital sector - as an element of this system - has also been affected .    2.3781006884491838
based on various legislation the financial framework has been reduced which has led to tendencies of economic limitation and UNK .    2.1064304187059983
from this background considerable risk selection and changes in emphasis might result .    2.4195939757758667
cost intensive patients with a high need for treatment are referred as quickly as possible and UNK to outpatient services despite unknown UNK follow - up care .    2.754228604340195
mostly the elderly are affected .    2.9414874373326025
medical rehabilitation can be found in this system at the cut between sgb v and sgb xi .    2.4481010549305395
however , this division raises problems and discussions concerning benefit UNK ( rehabilitation before nursing , priority of home , etc . ) .    1.8442514805079013
right in rehabilitation the most important thing is an overlap of sectors .    2.5994548588477335
various medical , nursing and other social supplies have to be put into a network to achieve an integral treatment of patients that focuses on the individual situation .    2.5234081183347996
in 1995 the ethics commission of the medical university of lübeck was asked to rule on whether a preimplantation diagnostic procedure ( pid ) could be performed on a husband and wife who were both carriers of the cystic fibrosis mutation UNK .    2.018994723058293
the couple had previously given birth to a child with cystic fibrosis and had twice terminated a pregnancy following prenatal screening .    2.0250248790413687
ethically , the performance of a pid was certainly warranted for this couple .    2.3635582973027764
the risk of UNK UNK section 1 and / or 2 section 1 ( " UNK cells shall not be removed for diagnostic purposes " ) of the law for the protection of embryos ( eschg ) was judged to be UNK in written statements from two expert witnesses ( prof . k . v .    2.449184798435339
UNK and prof . h . m . UNK , both UNK ) .    2.8698905544926085
in the view of the ethics commission , only UNK section 2 ( " an ovum shall be UNK only for the purpose of inducing pregnancy " ) of the eschg currently UNK pids .    2.479350868024895
in light of the social and biological arguments in favor of pids , however , the ethics commission questioned whether this section of the eschg is still morally justifiable .    2.5448675281021744
a 38 year old male patient with a coarctation of the aorta was successfully operated using an ascending aorta - abdominal aorta bypass ( UNK ) .    2.3372192141468937
the diagnosis of a severe UNK stenosis had been confirmed by aortography .    2.6989370616372255
after prosthetic repair of coarctation , blood pressure became normotensive and claudicatio intermittens disappeared .    2.180423235305205
iatrogenic colonic perforation is a rare but very dangerous complication of colonoscopy .    2.5652543131188503
we report on eleven UNK recorded patients treated between 1994 and 1998 .    2.2157928838724397
in seven cases the colonoscopy had been done for diagnostic and in four cases for therapeutic reason .    2.3119434272370505
nine women and two men ( age range 56 to 92 years ) were affected .    2.425063172985245
in 77 % the perforation was found in the sigmoid colon .    2.896708099381538
all patients were operated on and five sutures , five resections and one colostomy were performed .    2.215940464019434
no significant differences could be shown in six patients with classical perforation compared with five patients presenting with prolonged abdominal pain .    2.69267149506583
only duration of symptoms was significantly different in the two groups .    2.5807647509398945
three patients ( 85 , 90 and 92 years ) died from late complications .    2.2626253482787004
indications of mr arthrography were analyzed in this prospective study .    2.625450385889506
the aim was to evaluate possible advantages over conventional mri , establish diagnostic criteria and to analyze its meaning further for the therapeutic management of postoperative patients .    2.3895643403826456
nerve fibre - neuroendocrine cell complexes ( nf - nec - c ' s ) are neuroendocrine cells located in the lamina propria of the gastrointestinal tract directly connected with nerve fibres of UNK ' s plexus .    2.088288088513157
we report on a patient with sporadic UNK - UNK syndrome ( zes ) with electron microscopically demonstrated multiple nf - nec - c ' s in non - UNK gastric mucosa .    2.3468641534384784
it is suspected that in zes the UNK may represent a trophic stimulus for the proliferation of nf - nec - c ' s in the gastric mucosa .    2.030364043526587
introduction : the prehospitaly initiated endotracheal intubation and controlled ventilation , is especially in multi - system - trauma cases , recognized to be the " gold standard " .    2.2761617794516167
thus especially in view of the increasing demands being placed upon the quality of prehospital emergency treatment in general , the quality of such prehospital induced ventilation , is becoming of increasing importance .    2.7643069222875583
thereby we must take into consideration the limited UNK , which are afflicted with a high degree of UNK , which we have at our disposal to effectively evaluate the efficiency of emergency ventilation .    2.901107686820475
the purpose of our study within a collective of severely traumatized patients , was to determine the quality of prehospitaly induced ventilation with regards to the adequacy of oxygenation and ventilation and as a result of our findings , to identify areas for procedural optimization .    2.3972266383897414
staging of any tumor , i . e .    2.467280916731257
determination of the extent of the disease , serves to select the patients who might profit from curative surgical intervention or to define those patients with inoperable carcinomas who should be referred for other therapies , such as chemotherapy or irradiation .    2.5837482049901763
furthermore , accurate staging is necessary for assessment of prognosis , for radiation therapy planning , and for differentiation of those with small - cell lung cancer or for follow - up examinations of small - cell lung cancer patients after during and after chemotherapy .    2.555522334087576
the primary radiological staging and diagnostic modalities for assessment of bronchial carcinomas are computed tomography ( ct ) of the thorax including liver and adrenal glands , abdominal sonography , and bone scintigraphy .    2.3533119157479536
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) should be reserved for specific indications , e . g .    2.1647369583283913
infiltration of the chest wall or staging of patients with intolerance / allergy to intravenous contrast medium .    2.9347064004836834
the clinical value of nuclear medicine techniques , such as [ 18f ] 2 - fluoride - 2 - UNK - d - glucose positron emission tomography ( fdg - pet ) for evaluation of lymph nodes and distant metastases , in - 111 octreotide / UNK receptor scans for staging of small - cell lung cancer , and thallium - 201 spect are currently being assessed in numerous studies , although these techniques are already in routine use .    2.4103498327129618
in future these or nuclear medicine techniques , as well as techniques using molecular - based contrast material , especially for mr imaging , currently in experimental status , may yield serious potential for staging purposes .    2.270940399325435
background : we investigated fundus autofluorescence in vivo using a novel scanning laser ophthalmoscope .    2.1858301268407425
myocardial infarctions may be UNK by external triggers .    3.0817542215557365
external triggers include physical activity and emotional stress as well as other infrequent triggers such as war threats or UNK .    2.3049363323476393
changes in the environment also play an important role in the incidence of myocardial infarctions ; circadian , seasonal , and weekly variations have been observed .    2.516475658605902
appropriate preventive measures are indicated in order to protect patients during vulnerable periods .    2.888585828779524
health education should be directed towards patients ' behavior and promptly seeking medical assistance at the onset of symptoms .    2.0994603489486265
for these patients the absence of bone lesions is mandatory .    2.979949166633867
a patient suffering from long - standing pustular psoriasis of the palms was treated for 3 weeks with a mercury - containing drug .    2.3170278873164554
exacerbation into generalized pustular psoriasis developed .    2.4632534331521363
mercury levels in blood and urine were increased .    2.601293638352323
after withdrawal of the mercury preparation , therapy with UNK ( 2 , 3 - UNK - 1 - propane - UNK acid ) , a mercury UNK , was initiated , together with short - term treatment with aromatic UNK and puva .    3.057193316359559
within a few days mercury levels decreased significantly and the skin lesions practically disappeared .    2.5825516020165042
chromosomal analysis from peripheral blood cultures is a routine procedure while the analysis of meiotic chromosomes is labor intensive and mainly used in a scientific setting .    2.190312481140704
of all infertile males , 7 - 9 % show numerical and / or structural chromosomal abnormalities in their peripheral blood lymphocytes .    2.292033631214573
there is an inverse correlation between sperm count and the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities , with 21 % of patients with non - obstructive azoospermia having a chromosomal abnormality , most often klinefelter ' s syndrome .    2.5131682505890933
the rate of patients with chromosomal abnormalities is only 9 % in patients with severe UNK ( less than 5 million / ml ) , and structural abnormalities are found more often in this group .    3.288834878886236
using fluorescence in situ analysis the number of selected chromosomes can be assayed in single sperm cells .    2.311767310288691
there is no consensus on whether infertile men have a higher proportion of aneuploid ( UNK ) sperm cells than fertile men .    2.4055144303642213
taking into account the results from meiotic studies in infertile men , an increased rate of aneuploid sperm cells is likely .    2.1924614906617923
chromosomal analysis should be performed on all infertile men being treated with icsi as the result of this analysis could have important consequences in their reproductive decisions .    2.4201137283547207
background : tufted angioma represents a benign vascular lesion of the skin .    2.600917127523701
the knowledge of this distinctive entity is important in distinction of clinically more aggressive and malignant neoplasms respectively .    2.1440246703454107
limb lengthening in dwarfism has become a standardised procedure with a good prognosis .    2.424198607573959
in most cases external fixation is used .    2.6526515191590208
gain of leg length up to 15 cm and more is possible in the lower leg and the femur and 8 . 5 cm in the humerus .    2.6986568085126437
limb lengthening is useful in many cases of dwarfism due to skeletal dysplasia .    2.4229389637872014
there are a number of risks and possible complications involved and the procedure also requires considerable time .    2.4955783602867156
we report the results of 48 patients with dwarfism operated on in the orthopädische UNK UNK ( orthopaedic hospital for children ) .    2.4078260261740634
process - experiential ( pe ) therapy is a neo - humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client - centered emphasis on a genuine , UNK , empathic relationship and the active , task - focused process - directive style of gestalt therapy .    1.6870379410816876
a research - informed treatment ( grawe 1997 ) , its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory .    1.7968786267542993
it incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks , each of which is characterized by a specific client marker and resolution state , series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution , and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps .    1.6457374477375826
the first part of this review provides an overview of process - experiential therapy , including theoretical foundation , that is , emotion theory , dialectical UNK , and task analytic process orientation , and the basic treatment principles .    2.4840719754506426
malnutrition is a common finding amongst our UNK .    2.8737729889572416
the causes of malnutrition are multifactorial and although they have been extensively studied , they are not entirely understood .    2.410999419015842
both physiological and pathological processes of aging put this population at a higher risk of being UNK .    2.3165737727766387
these may be related to social , financial , psychological and / or physiological changes directly or indirectly associated to growing old .    2.4302886907368486
we report on a 76 - year - old female patient with clinical findings consistent with necrolytic migratory erythema .    2.2879252161200188
plasma UNK levels were slightly elevated , but advanced radiologic techniques revealed no evidence of an underlying pancreatic tumour .    2.225748784465181
the dermatosis responded excellently to oral therapy with dapsone .    2.39330201824516
the possible aetiology and pathogenesis of the " UNK syndrome " are discussed .    3.0483959926478703
complications during cataract surgery such as dropped nucleus or lens fragment dislocation into the vitreous cavity may become sight threatening .    1.9357472060249563
the recommendations regarding possible therapeutic approaches are inconsistent .    2.6341446523813397
several factors like uveitis and / or an increased intraocular pressure play a major role in the decision on the further surgical procedure .    2.6638075027685497
recent publications recommend an early pars plana approach in order to avoid any traction at the peripheral retina during manipulations via a limbal approach .    2.125749829685324
the authors describe the histopathology of the resting cartilage and the growth plate in a case of UNK dysplasia and review the differential diagnosis with UNK dysplasia and UNK type ii .    2.5580578543112633
objective : hypoplastic left heart ( hlh ) is a complex developmental malformation of the left ventricle , aorta , and associated valves .    2.598748879222398
survival beyond neonatal period is the exception in untreated infants .    2.2898294918538626
the prognosis , however , is no longer UNK .    3.58783577345588
forty - one patients demonstrating clinical symptoms for cerebral infarction were investigated by magnetic resonance imaging with diffusion - weighted echo - planar imaging ( dwi ) and t2 - weighted imaging ( t2wi ) .    2.1127431683608715
in 8 patients only dwi showed the cerebral lesions clearly .    2.366382178828158
one patient with positive dwi and t2wi suffered from hsv encephalitis .    2.2021112011142576
dwi is superior to t2wi in assessment of small cortical infarcts and cerebral infarction in patients with preexisting vascular lesions .    2.64874843702987
dwi is not specific , so other causes like cerebral hematoma and encephalitis have to be considered .    2.1837718112678184
juvenile polyposis was first described by cronkhite and canada in 1955 .    2.4237219962904137
this disease is characterized by juvenile intestinal polyps and ectodermal abnormalities .    2.4854675869400213
the etiology of cronkhite - canada syndrome ( ccs ) , however , is still not well understood .    2.5752215536216343
interestingly , among patients with ccs a significant correlation ( 16 . 5 % ) with intestinal carcinomas has been observed .    2.640144611213322
thus , malignant transformation and / or genetic predisposition may be involved in the initiation of the disease .    3.041733064460674
in the following , epidemiology , symptoms , morphology and therapy of ccs are discussed .    2.406637618161577
our examinations are based on studies reported in the literature and on a case report of a female patient who developed a colon carcinoma 2 years after initial diagnosis of ccs .    3.105233170003617
pacemaker erythema is a rare , irreversible side effect of cardiac pacemakers , clinically characterized by UNK teleangiectatic erythema .    2.7328439826386295
histology reveals teleangiectatic vessels in the superficial dermis and a slight perivascular infiltrate .    2.3208461332202375
we report on three patients presenting with pacemaker erythema following either pacemaker or defibrillator implantation .    2.0914236412387437
the pathogenesis of this histopathologically uncharacteristic lesion is unknown .    2.5002543857413726
in contrast to peri - or postoperative pacemaker infections , physical irritation can be considered a possible triggering mechanism .    2.3516738439774656
allergic reactions to the implanted material have been ruled out by negative patch test results .    2.2376814875054776
the present legal requirements for the prescription of controlled drugs remains an UNK to adequate therapy for chronic pain because of an abundance of legal regulations .    2.2108384674670774
the physician prescribing opioids must consider the permitted maximum amount per prescription , the period of time the drug is prescribed for , numerous cross references , and other special regulations , and he still cannot be sure that he does not UNK certain legal requirements .    1.9728678897855905
often these difficulties result in withholding necessary pain treatment !    2.347646910711176
in the authors ' opinion it should be sufficient to write a specific prescription form for controlled drugs in the same way as any other ordinary prescription without UNK the safety of the drug control system .    2.308817797950196
it is important that the use of the narcotic be justified in the sense of § 13 abs .    2.58335140170043
1 of the drug control regulation , as judged by the responsible UNK of the drug , and that any offence be UNK .    2.9232511939030412
the use of triplicate prescriptions guarantees sufficient proof .    2.3736452347811876
legislation is requested that will substitute for the present drug control regulations , which are difficult to handle .    2.7627798353440527
the aim of the study was to investigate the ability to activate the quadriceps femoris muscle voluntarily in patients after severe knee injuries and it ' s influence on muscle function .    2.2227033338011735
33 male patients after acl - rupture with concomitant injuries were investigated with a twitch - UNK - method to determine the maximal UNK contraction force ( UNK ) and the ability to activate the quadriceps muscle voluntarily .    2.827215077343078
the results were compared to a previously investigated group of patients after isolated acl - rupture and to an aged - matched control group .    2.5232620067912963
managed care , i . e . , the integration of health insurance and delivery of care under the direction of one organization , is gaining importance in the usa health market .    2.4543439437023165
the initial effects consisted of a decrease in insurance UNK , a very attractive feature for employers .    2.7632166968949017
managed care promises to contain UNK for health care .    2.383322003321589
given the shrinking public resources in germany , managed care seems attractive for the german health system , too .    2.3442244210326755
in this review the development of managed care , the principal elements , forms of organisation and practical tools are outlined .    2.479987983825123
the regulation of the delivery of care by means of controlling and financial incentives UNK the autonomy of physicians : the physician must act as a " double agent " , caring for the interest for the individual patient and being restricted by the contract with the managed care organisation .    2.206397819044618
cost containment by managed care was achieved by reducing the fees for physicians and hospitals ( and partly by restricting care for patients ) .    2.2251069972082558
only a fraction of this cost reduction was UNK over to the UNK or UNK , and most of the UNK was returned with profit to the UNK of the managed care organisations .    3.9128965939629268
the UNK role of primary care physicians as UNK of the health network led to a reduced demand for specialist services in general and for university hospitals and anesthesiologists in particular .    2.5241026446286807
the paradigm of managed care , i . e . , to guide the patient and the care UNK through the health care system in order to achieve cost - effective and high quality care , seems very attractive .    2.737564716331364
the stress on cost minimization by any means in the daily practice of managed care makes it doubtful if managed care should be an option for the german health system , in particular because there are a number of restrictions on it in german law .    2.355964519190222
background : analysis of the impact of head fractures , intracranial hemorrhages , brain edema , and prognostic risk factors on long - term outcome in children with severe head injury .    2.6994213561819507
background : in the past , the main problem of transscleral cyclophotocoagulation was related to the energy dosage of the individual effect .    2.9352843355647376
since the target tissue is not directly observable , no information about the coagulation process was available to the surgeon .    2.2920240154864167
high inter - and intraindividual variations of the tissue properties often led to under - or overdosage .    2.3731098619026714
UNK is therapeutically UNK , while overdosage causes the so - called " UNK " which may induce severe damage to the eye .    2.632320072975494
in the past , most scientific or routine studies on heart rate variability ( hrv ) were done using commercial holter ecg devices with traditional magnetic UNK .    1.9668210651640037
all methods to calculate parameters of hrv are based on the measurement of time intervals between successive sinus cardiac beats , in practice rr intervals .    2.447134593769585
hence , results of hrv calculation depend on the quality of primary data acquisition .    2.9577170435257325
however , technical standards on accuracy of rr interval acquisition in magnetic tape and digital solid state holter ecg systems do not exist as yet .    2.083063996912177
therefore in a laboratory investigation accuracy of hrv parameter calculation after traditional standard tape with and without real - time analysis and digital solid state data acquisition was compared in three commercial holter ecg systems [ UNK medical ( e ) , oxford medilog excel ( o ) and medset UNK ( m ) ] .    1.9072091786730576
a computer - based ecg simulator was used to UNK a test signal consisting of artificial p - qrs complexes of fixed rate , UNK stabilized " sinus rhythms " .    2.1164388708565784
two channel analog tape and digital 24h recordings of the fixed rate test signal were performed simultaneously .    2.0736924927069955
the influence of recording technology on accuracy of rr interval measurement and consequently on time UNK hrv was shown by comparing five standard 24 - h time domain parameters .    1.9322775691034364
as expected , in the three holter systems the analog tape recordings showed a higher , technically induced , artificial rr variability .    2.420292063018574
the sdnn values ( e : 9 . 38ms vs 2 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ; o : 3 . 89ms vs 0 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ; m : 10 . UNK vs 2 . 89ms ; p = 0 . 001 ) , sdnn - index values ( e : 8 . UNK vs 0 . 90ms ; p < 0 . 001 ; o : 3 . UNK vs 0 . 90ms ; p < 0 . 001 ; m : 7 . UNK vs 1 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 ) and rmssd - values ( e : 10 . UNK vs 2 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ; o : 10 . UNK vs 1 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 ; m : 8 . UNK vs 1 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ) were significantly lower if acquisition was done by digital solid devices in all systems , UNK ( m : 9 . UNK vs 5 . UNK ; p < 0 . 001 ) in the medset system too .    2.2144595693173525
the used method is a possible way to validate commercial holter ecg systems for hrv analysis .    2.3916836649409037
clinical significance of artifical hrv seems to be low .    3.1574696019393196
cases of gallstone ileus ( 108 ) were analyzed retrospectively over 30 years .    2.2494197199162396
even today , when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is done , the incidence of this rare disease remains the same .    2.7651928802616688
history , clinical and x - ray findings are non - specific .    3.1729190395341544
UNK was seen in 17 % of the patients .    3.2797139663156756
since 1992 sonography has UNK an exact diagnosis in 10 of 15 cases .    2.5283250823844177
in the triad of known gallstone , non - specific epigastric pain with assumed small intestinal obstruction , and impossible detection of a stone in the gallbladder , there is strong suspicion of a gallstone ileus .    2.3857448098223433
the evidence is given if the gallstone is seen in the UNK .    2.94391921444491
intraoperatively more than one stone was found in the intestines in 20 % , and UNK fistulas were encountered in 83 % .    3.135626835065318
there has been no significant change in mortality for 30 years .    2.4761061054535256
autologous transplantation in brachial plexus injuries has become significantly more efficacious through increased knowledge of the UNK anatomy of the fascicle structures and the refinement of UNK techniques .    2.5837647133077364
recovery of shoulder and upper arm functions can be achieved with autologous transplantation in the majority of patients under optimized conditions .    2.6523291970010816
however , attempts to restore forearm , hand and finger functions in this way have been disappointing so far .    2.1915824254219327
therapeutic success is primarily governed by early decision making , selection of adequate surgical strategies and intensive and UNK postoperative management .    2.128792599989076
leg venectasia is a common problem .    2.978555610376792
although there are a variety of therapeutic modalities , none of them gives satisfactory results .    2.6124398821672936
the effects of sclerotherapy in the treatment of telangiectasia with a small diameter are poor .    2.782793122786931
UNK and argon laser treatment often result in scarring .    2.34494916256762
we studied the effectiveness of the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser at a wavelength of UNK nm in the treatment of leg venectasia .    2.4658463133148065
after repeated treatments using this laser system , only 30 % of the vessels that looked blue on clinical examination could be removed ; we obtained better UNK of smaller red , UNK vessels with a diameter up to 0 . 4 mm .    2.479664733156637
however , hyperpigmentation frequently developed after treatment .    2.3498231265035017
in post - treatment biopsies , occlusion of the vessels was found .    2.8645486264516236
based on these results , we recommend a combined therapy for leg venectasia .    2.845087408172435
larger diameter vessels should be treated with sclerotherapy , while UNK telangiectasia can be treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser .    2.540230812507136
total hip replacement is often recommended for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients .    2.931166028801574
a less invasive approach with shorter operating time is the replacement of the femoral head only , leaving the acetabular cartilage in situ .    2.5398200574474075
hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using a metallic head prosthesis was not successful in the past , because the majority of patients developed protrusio acetabuli after surgery .    2.520900527887211
in the present study hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an al2o3 - ceramic head was shown to be a useful method for the treatment of femoral neck fractures in elderly patients .    2.5323861453175622
from 1985 to 1990 UNK patients were treated with hemiarthroplasty .    3.121808324168604
the average age at the time of accident and operation was 81 . 7 years .    2.6062343488265567
at the time of follow - up in 1993 only 77 survivors were available for examination .    2.6926815778676203
a standardized score was calculated assessing activity , gait , hip pain , etc . , with the patients obtaining an average score of 58 out of a possible 78 points .    2.562873093935652
only three patients had hip pain , and in four cases the roentgenographic examination revealed protrusio acetabuli .    2.865112493201895
two of these four patients underwent revision surgery for replacement of the cup , leaving the stem in situ .    2.4109632124420384
in view of the small number of approach - related complications , hemiarthroplastic hip replacement using an al2o3 - ceramic head is the recommended surgical treatment for femoral neck fractures in elderly patients .    2.1592450812098876
functional relaxation ( fe ) , a somato - psychotherapeutic method , can reduce asthmatic symptoms .    2.3599044967025082
the efficiency of a 5 minute introduction of elements of functional relaxation ( efe ) is compared with a placebo - relaxation - method not based on the hypothetical mechanisms of fe , and a standardised pharmacological UNK test using salbutamol .    2.3313931959514695
in a controlled prospective randomised single blind setting 18 children and adolescents with acute asthma were treated on three consecutive days with each method .    2.0297359072378933
before and ten minutes after therapy the patients had UNK pulmonary function testing .    2.633090068417224
u - tests showed that the baseline measurements were comparable .    2.760819898626516
the before - after - comparison revealed significant changes for efe and salbutamol , not for the placebo - relaxation .    2.0610948036892687
there were significant differences between the intraindividual differences of the airway resistance and the specific airway resistance between salbutamol and the placebo - relaxation , not between efe and salbutamol or efe and the placebo - relaxation .    2.0648961355632434
fe can be an effective complementary treatment in children or adolescents with asthma .    2.522759848644878
the following three case studies will prove , that the sonographic diagnosis of a fatty liver is often related to a metabolic disease , beginning at the age of 4 to 5 years in conjunction with the morbus wilson .    2.488796711993619
3d ultrasound will find in the next years a wide popularity under the medical imaging applications .    2.126349475805575
the method expands the well - known sonography on the third dimension , therefore it becomes possible to generate spatial 3d views of internal organs .    2.134624101744334
it is further possible to display static ( 3d ) as well as dynamic organs ( UNK , e . g .    2.6957858137379
the clarity of the three - dimensional presentation supports very effectively the navigation .    2.5439310974617833
58 patients following gustilo iiib open tibial fractures , treated by serial debridements , osteosynthesis and microvascular free tissue transfer were investigated after an average of 6 years .    2.1035211545589494
assessment of life satisfaction was done by means of a proven valid and reliable test instrument ( UNK - " UNK zur UNK " ) .    2.74513128674774
further specific questions on treatment satisfaction , aesthetic result , occupation and income were added to this questionnaire .    2.0602367717551417
significant discrepancies of the items recreational activities , income , occupation and partnership , productivity , mobility and pain were evaluated in comparison to available data of healthy west german population .    2.1248231432349325
the calculated global index of life satisfaction and health differed significantly from the established index of west german population .    2.122873001930093
although specific aspects like aesthetic result , donor site morbidity , pain and even function were critically judged , 91 % of the patients were satisfied with the long term result of the treatment .    2.8153832911849737
none of the patients thought that an initial amputation probably might have been a better solution .    2.5475304037652777
the UNK employment rate was 64 % .    2.4885707011544858
limb salvage of gustilo iiib fractures by means of a multidisciplinary treatment protocol is able to afford useful and satisfying long time results .    2.3448428174376494
however , an impairment of quality of life , at least in specific items has to be considered .    2.7658251649074765
the case of a 10 - year - old boy with post - traumatic priapism after perineal trauma is presented .    2.7016170514032023
interdisciplinary treatment using angiography and selective catheter embolization for juvenile high - flow priapism is demonstrated .    2.1670778772704593
the literature and the diagnostic possibilities resulting from color duplex sonography are discussed .    2.61679967950059
only 53 % - 58 % of patients with a subarachnoid haemorrhage ( UNK ) following the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm survive without neurological damage .    2.957622976465319
morbidity and mortality are closely related to the delayed ischaemic neurological deficit due to cerebral vasospasm .    2.480849622571237
the following review gives an account of pathophysiological mechanisms ; the importance of treatment with calcium antagonists , UNK haemodilution , and induced arterial hypertension is discussed in light of the current literature .    2.410170760374346
during the last decade an unusual amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis has been described in association with autoimmune disease in sixteen female patients .    2.401264290465424
the clinical hallmark is a sterile pustular dermatosis preferentially located in intertriginous regions that responds to local or systemic corticosteroids .    2.011215474410495
histologic features are UNK sometimes UNK neutrophilic UNK .    2.3785401423766572
we report an additional patient suffering from this unusual dermatosis .    2.4731765339936214
an overview of the patients described to date and a review of the literature are given in an attempt to delineate this amicrobial intertriginous pustulosis from the known pustular dermatoses .    2.4516736686453178
the area " environment and health " is characterized by interdisciplinary features and , consequently , an intense need for communication .    2.1982579263610114
a comparison of national problem solving strategies concerning electronic network activities within this area led to the development project for a european information and communication platform .    2.1550890147342048
by this electronic platform the international exchange of experiences , coordination of activities , UNK efforts and an optimization of qualification possibilities for environmental health professionals will become easier .    1.8256722783504884
no removal of bony wedge thus avoiding leg shortening .    2.310048998005199
the aim of this study was to analyze the localization and distribution of extracellular matrix in normal and glaucomatous damaged optic discs using immunohistochemical methods .    2.130523298513407
five eyes UNK for corneal UNK without any history of glaucoma and three other eyes with secondary glaucoma were studied .    2.004526934465631
immunohistochemical reactions were performed with antibodies against collagen types i , iii , iv and vi and against laminin , proliferating antigen ki 67 and gfap .    2.0498823913983024
in glaucomatous eyes the characteristic arrangement of collagen fibrils is lacking .    2.229953797620994
septa of the lamina cribrosa appear enlarged .    2.5622278803698237
the immunoreactivity of all examined collagen types is stronger in glaucomatous eyes .    2.1592707435612613
the axon basement membranes show an irregular and interrupted pattern .    2.1319014076367195
the number of proliferating cells with positive gfap staining in glaucomatous UNK plates is distinctly higher .    2.117229550023319
we postulate that fibroblasts and astrocytes in the stroma of glaucomatous lamina cribrosa could be stimulated to increased and uncontrolled proliferation .    1.8765378943251965
associated UNK and raised secretion of extracellular matrix may lead to axon constriction and , secondarily , to neural degeneration .    2.2728935336852243
concomitant pathologies ( labral lesions , intra - / extra - osseous ganglia and stress bone marrow edema ) in adult residual hip dysplasia ( rhd ) might influence the outcome of conservative hip surgery .    2.069536182432857
the aim of our prospective clinical study was to assess the value of preoperative mr arthrography in diagnosing concomitant lesions and in making surgical decisions in rhd .    2.3071031805819855
the first 37 consecutive patients with a minimum follow - up of 18 months have been analysed .    3.33918516372879
all 37 patients presented rhd with the clinical symptomatology of labral lesions and underwent routine preoperative mra .    2.273873380474021
according to clinical , radiological and mr UNK criteria , these 37 patients were subdivided into four therapeutic subgroups : ( 1 ) reorientation of the acetabulum using the UNK triple pelvic osteotomy ( tpo ) ; ( 2 ) intertrochanteric varisation osteotomy ( UNK ) ; ( 3 ) palliative decompression with only symptomatic partial resection of the torn labrum ( pall ) ; ( 4 ) primary total hip replacement ( tep ) .    2.451892191548155
based on the preliminary clinical and radiological outcomes of these four subgroups , the following conclusions can be drawn : labral lesions are considered to be a sign of chronic joint instability .    2.513570694143888
therefore , acetabular UNK should be corrected by UNK osteotomy of the acetabulum ( tpo - subgroup ) even in low grades of rhd if labral lesions are present .    2.137990653305373
" palliative " labral resections without corrective osteotomy ( pall subgroup ) in secondary osteoarthritis due to rhd are definitively obsolete , because they rapidly progress to severe osteoarthritis due to surgically accelerated joint instability .    1.8172021808387464
in rhd with highly osteoarthritic hip joints and concomitant lesions , one should not hesitate to perform primary thr even in young patients .    2.0271840541810886
severe infections of the talus are often associated with complete septic collapse of the talus .    2.914424824699878
in this connection , open fractures with defects or significant comminution have a bad prognosis is as far as reconstruction of the talus is concerned .    2.4389975969661073
in the department of traumatology , UNK , in 1995 three patients ( all male , average age 35 . 3 + / - 10 . 2 years ) were treated with cancellous bone grafting after talectomy performed because of infection and complete septic collapse of the talus .    2.8941617789997838
in two of these cases third - degree open total dislocation of the talus had been sustained .    2.8717832762970663
the third patient came to us after undergoing arthroscopy of the ankle region in another hospital .    2.372673764507016
in each case a UNK infection was the outcome .    2.7156309902395037
following a step - by - step algorithm , in a first step urgent radical debridement with talectomy was done .    2.2853691140921324
to maintain UNK between the tibia and calcaneus on one side and the os UNK on the other , the bony defect was filled with pmma chains and the external fixateur technique was used for immobilization during treatment of the infection .    2.623231868314749
after second - and third - look procedures a free flap was grown for soft tissue coverage within the first 10 days .    2.2716371884109017
after 17 . 6 + / - 3 . 3 days the talus was replaced with a cancellous bone graft , combined with double arthrodesis in two cases , and external fixation for the next 4 - 5 weeks .    2.8182905023853717
in the third patient a triple arthrodesis was done .    2.563359651428054
at follow - up after an average of 12 months ( range 8 - 17 months ) , the bone graft with arthrodesis had been completely integrated in all cases .    3.082935391014825
all patients are free of symptoms in normal life .    2.955916395948842
in the case of severe open fractures of the talus with significant comminution combined with infection and septic bone collapse conservation of the talus is often impossible .    2.4588030606908076
the combination of homologous cancellous bone grafting and arthrodesis after talectomy is therefore a good method of keeping any decrease in the function of the foot to a minimum .    2.3770262477268016
meningitis caused by streptococcus suis was diagnosed in a 63 year old female in austria .    2.6195350408839104
sixteen months after onset she still suffers from ataxia , disturbance of gait and bilateral hearing impairment .    2.0515877592140246
being a farmer , the patient belongs to a recognized high - risk - group , as most other infected people do .    2.641627950306966
to the best of our knowledge , there has been no report of a human infection by streptococcus suis in austria so far .    2.3398909570650086
the results of neurophysiological tests excluded a direct lesion to the cochlea during the acute phase of meningitis , and thus , are in contrast to the UNK - pig - model by kay , who showed suppurative labyrinthitis being the cause of hearing loss .    2.4453763892813445
the present knowledge of streptococcus suis meningitis with respect to neurophysiology , pathogenesis , epidemiology and increasing resistance against antibiotics is discussed .    2.2232815803538757
the introduction of atypical antipsychotics has presented new options for the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenic patients .    2.208407773317875
it is assumed that in the near future , neuroleptic medication will shift from conventional to atypical antipsychotics for an increasing number of patients .    2.315038340891874
the present article addresses guidelines for the conversion from conventional to atypical neuroleptics in inpatient and outpatient settings .    2.220274452477607
numerous epidemiological studies about multiple trauma patients do not include an analysis of patients under the age of 18 .    3.111909458840634
to study this , the data of UNK patients with multiple traumata , treated between 1981 and 1991 at hannover medical school , germany , were retrospectively analyzed .    2.9081133561808126
the patients were divided into four age - related groups : UNK age ( < 6 years ) , school age ( < 13 years ) , teenagers ( < 18 years ) and adults ( l 18 years ) .    2.4942988124141707
children were less often injured as passengers in cars , but more often injured as pedestrians and UNK than adults .    2.1685680486896435
however , children showed a significant higher mortality than adults , with threefold increased risk of death when they injured as passengers in car accidents .    2.345026450403157
in all groups injuries to the head and the legs were most common .    2.9374714694062876
children showed a lower incidence of trauma to the thorax , abdomen , hip and arms than the adult group .    2.2062630239542256
nevertheless , trauma to the thorax , abdomen and head was associated with the highest risk of death in all groups .    2.79462250120588
spinal cord injuries , especially injuries to the neck , also showed a high risk of death .    3.214210472728031
safety improvements for children in cars , UNK usage on UNK and early training in traffic safety for children might decrease the lethality in this group of trauma patients .    2.1987009637739257
during the past 7 years 45 patients have been operated upon using the childs - phillips method .    2.2941233727242385
of those , 37 were subsequently examined for the study - 7 patients had died in the meantime .    2.7154326825046593
none of the deaths occurred as a direct result of UNK small - bowel plication .    2.364026028295149
an early recurrence of intestinal obstruction occurred in 4 . 4 % and a laparotomy was repeated .    3.003075913260297
during the most recent examinations 86 . 5 % of those patients checked had ( virtually ) no complaints - 91 . 9 % based upon the visick classification .    2.544345539874961
a subtotal intestinal obstruction occurred during the period of the study in 8 . 1 % of cases , but could be conservatively treated .    3.531113660079255
up until the most recent examination there were still no instances of a late recurrence .    2.2617617063205
most intestinal obstruction recurrences are due to errors specific to the technique and are early recurrences .    2.3626538511110744
on the basis of our results , we are of the opinion that plication in the presence of existing peritonitis , as well as partial plication , is acceptable .    2.7834878432807253
to prospectively survey skin lesions in a large group of newborns , as no such study has as yet been performed in germany .    2.135879553727185
we present the case of a 35 - year - old patient suffering from UNK psychosis .    2.7312796390274343
after 4 weeks on UNK he developed acute priapism .    2.4662524947613647
possible explanations and pathophysiology are discussed as well as the requirement for sufficient information of the patient .    2.871157595276196
delay of urgent urologic treatment UNK the risk of irreversible UNK .    2.7780283532346104
the patient ' s history should be evaluated with respect to former unphysiological prolonged erections .    2.8547045703363536
the further development of 162 stroke patients ( average age 77 years ) , who were UNK assessed during hospitalization , was evaluated ca .    2.6112083694387094
questionnaires were mailed to patients .    2.5731607892140658
53 % of the patients ( n = 86 ) returned the questionnaire UNK filled in ; 20 % ( n = 32 ) had died ; in the remaining 27 % of cases ( n = 44 ) no information was obtained on further development .    3.0386385126115476
80 % of those patients who responded lived at home despite numerous medical problems .    2.4375034096448807
family members assumed most of the care required .    3.011658988865923
follow - up treatment and pain therapy proved to be particularly problematic .    2.9962571793373938
the barthel index according to data collected was significantly lower compared to figures noted upon release from the hospital .    2.212863485573641
hardly anyone among those patients received follow - up treatment .    3.0293281012798183
74 % of patients complained of pain although the majority has regular contacts with the family doctor .    2.6370299180452306
for those patients who died in the 18 months interval , significantly lower values for the activities of daily living ( adl ) has already been recorded upon hospitalization .    2.364600836407512
they had a less favorable view of their state of health and were less satisfied with life in general .    2.3436330128721954
the routine staging work - up for renal cancer includes a contrast - enhanced UNK spiral ct and a chest radiograph .    2.5261946589259825
if there is doubt regarding the presence and extent of ( UNK ) ivc thrombus , mr imaging should be performed .    2.8323538983710774
dynamic contrast - enhanced mr imaging should be used in place of ct in any patient with severe renal dysfunction , symptomatic polycystic kidney disease , or a history of allergy to UNK contrast media .    2.470096162471671
cavography is no longer needed in the era of ( adaptive array UNK ) spiral ct and mr UNK .    2.503740382346327
patients : we report on four infants with nonketotic UNK , three with a neonatal form and one with the milder infantile form .    2.422564032431899
despite early diagnosis and persistent therapy including dextromethorphan and sodium benzoate , two infants with the neonatal form deteriorated progressively and died at the age of 16 and 50 months , respectively , only one survived severely retarded with seizures , UNK and spastic UNK .    2.3745759095815657
the serum concentrations of glycine decreased following sodium benzoate treatment but cerebrospinal fluid / serum glycine ratio remained elevated with no improvement in clinical outcome .    1.8699405993861
the patient with the infantile form has been treated for over three years with dextromethorphan , and is now a severely retarded child without seizure activity and continuous psychomotor development .    2.1953647741854923
immunosuppression - related candida infections may be most successfully treated using biological response modifiers and recombinant cytokines to enhance expression of host pro - inflammatory and antimicrobial mediators , notably tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf - ) , interleukin 1 ( il - 1 ) , and gamma - interferon ( gamma - ifn ) .    2.087287867718356
UNK , preclinical studies to date have found that the UNK of such UNK does not compromise , and actually may improve , the efficacy of synthetic antifungals .    2.724280050777834
such combination therapies should continue to be evaluated in animal models of candida infection which otherwise progress to lethal shock or chronic disseminated disease despite aggressive use of existing antifungal agents .    1.9861857463963077
bilateral neck exploration is the standard procedure in primary hyperparathyroidism .    2.9296503624650976
using a bilateral approach , preoperative localization studies are not mandatory .    2.332846956869409
a localized single gland disease is the basis for a minimally invasive procedure .    2.8970137162378573
therefore preoperative localization techniques play an important role in planning ( minimally invasive ) first time exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism .    2.13709265587572
the combination of 99 UNK - UNK scintigraphy with ultrasound allows correct localization of the parathyroid adenoma in 86 % of all single gland diseases .    2.6840029382052237
multiple gland disease could be predicted in isolated cases only .    2.3290499935777116
computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging could not improve the results .    2.653803849456001
surgery for persistent or recurrent hyperparathyroidism should only be performed after positive localization studies .    2.4883829222932397
prehospital thrombolysis is often recommended for patients in whom a major time gain of > 90 min compared to in - hospital therapy is expected .    2.292473669166928
it has been repeatedly shown by metropolitan rescue services that very early presentation after onset of symptoms in a high percentage of patients offers an additional chance for optimizing thrombolytic therapy .    2.189661498444736
more than half of all patients presenting with an acute myocardial infarction to the ems may be treated within 90 min after symptom onset , enabling preservation of major myocardial areas at risk .    2.544816482759168
thus , prehospital thrombolysis in metropolitan areas offers a chance to take advantage of an ideal time window , without additional risk .    2.1296048852601586
moreover , technical and diagnostic preconditions are easily fulfilled .    2.2770039439487393
low resection and intersphincteric extirpation of rectal cancer in the distal third of the rectum has become an accepted sphincter - saving method .    2.481772837487015
from december 1990 to december 1994 , 42 patients ( 17 women and 25 men ) with a mean age of 67 . 2 years had a low resection or extirpation of the rectum at our institution .    2.5903837193577113
we had a lethality rate of 2 . 5 % and a anastomotic insufficiency rate of 14 % .    2.9785627517136812
" notox histological UNK " is a formaldehyde substitute for the fixation of tissues prior to histological investigation .    2.30039804744412
intraoperative samples and necropsy tissue were tested .    2.469830388688187
notox was substituted for formaldehyde in the fixation step , otherwise the same manufacturer - specified protocols were used for all UNK .    2.110583181475786
conventional histological and accepted immunohistological investigations , especially for tumour diagnosis , were used .    2.3820991118712906
in all tests , results with notox - fixated tissue were similar to those with tissue fixed with formaldehyde regarding both staining and diagnosis .    2.058040332216218
notox is a useful substitute for formaldehyde .    2.8248434056033354
in addition to mainly cellular reactions detectable by routine histological or enzyme histochemical techniques , immunohistochemical parameters and their forensic value are especially discussed .    1.8288687470449296
a dynamic helical ct scan following initial ultrasound provides reliable radiological staging for kidney traumas and immediate diagnosis of most abdominal injuries .    1.9238033222583202
it also proves useful for pediatric traumas .    2.4023738454291252
using mainly ct data we apply a classification system proposed by the american association for surgery of trauma ( grade i - v ) .    2.1792085958072387
the diagnostic steps and subsequent management are demonstrated by flow - chart .    2.2476467392024033
most renal traumas may be treated conservatively but persistent bleeding or persistent urinary extravasation may necessitate surgical intervention .    2.1536737144638276
in cases of exploration of the kidney , the use of fibrin adhesive , alloplastic mesh capsule and UNK stents enables the reconstruction of the kidney .    2.581343446511604
with worldwide over UNK applications , vascular closure devices have been established as an essential tool of invasive cardiology .    2.3775736859209227
this overview compares today ' s four commercially available closure devices , vasoseal ( vs ) , angio - sealtm ( as ) , UNK , inc . ( pc ) and UNK ( du ) for their usefulness after coronary interventions .    2.268218488529443
the published data regarding deployment success rates for vs , as , pc and du are in the range of 88 % , 91 % , 90 % and 98 % up to 100 % , respectively .    2.24745506628245
times to hemostasis were 5 - 13 ' , 2 - 4 ' , 11 - 19 ' and 4 - 14 ' , accompanied by times to mobilization of 6 - 9h , 6 - UNK , 4 - UNK and 2 - UNK .    2.7070373353439527
minor complications were described in 8 % , 5 . 9 % , 5 . 3 % and 2 . 1 % , major complications in 5 . 3 % , 1 . 3 % , 4 % and 2 . 6 % .    4.012396169879087
although none of the closure devices has been shown to reduce major local complications as compared to manual compression , all UNK devices have documented a significant reduction in time to hemostasis .    2.5478586223395463
the increased patient comfort is essentially related to the ability of sheath removal immediately after ptca .    2.546387246178135
vascular closure devices reduce the burden of medical staff and decrease hospital costs by earlier discharge .    2.1247919640836086
polyhydramnios occurs in 0 . 2 to 1 . 6 % of pregnancies .    3.5397305729324127
it may be due to a number of congenital anomalies , an abnormal karyotype , maternal diabetes , rh - disease or intrauterine infections potentially requiring non - invasive or invasive measures .    2.3860696528055403
however , the most common indication for prenatal intervention due to polyhydramnios is the twin - twin - transfusion syndrom ( ttts ) .    2.164249353678692
treatment of polyhydramnios may focus on correction of the causative lesion , or symptomatic relief through drainage of amniotic fluid .    2.275330241496028
maternal administration of UNK inhibitors represents a further , non - invasive therapeutic option .    2.8037641729527993
indomethacin , UNK , or UNK reduce the fetal urine output thus decreasing amniotic fluid volume over time without the risks associated with invasive procedures .    2.4827189076066443
however , potentially serious ductal constriction as well as a delay in the onset of amniotic fluid reduction have limited its application .    2.53023453841073
percutaneous amniotic fluid drainage may provide immediate reduction of intrauterine pressure , but is associated with a complication rate of 1 to 1 . 5 % .    2.8373786288400535
the hemodynamic characteristics of UNK pregnancies complicated by ttts have led to the development of endoscopic laser coagulation of placental vascular anastomoses as a definitive treatment .    2.2323464034950677
treatment is only required in a small UNK of pregnancies with polyhydramnios .    2.5901372719942115
mild cases can be managed UNK .    3.0836446728065536
intrauterine pressure increases with an excessive increase in amniotic fluid volume ( UNK > 400 mm or UNK > 150 mm ) leads to the elevation of intrauterine pressure .    2.1741173158692546
complications such as preterm premature rupture of membranes and preterm labor may lead to premature delivery .    2.4960204504293264
the main goal of prenatal treatment of polyhydramnios is thus the improvement of fetal outcome through prolongation of gestation and / or the UNK of maternal symptoms .    2.6462563141622457
with the recent developments in computer technology and the improvements in modern neuroimaging , frame - based stereotactic guidance for open microsurgical procedures has been increasingly replaced by neuronavigation , also called UNK stereotaxy .    1.8992295267891708
it allows transfer of individual patient ' s images onto the operative field to assist the neurosurgeon intraoperatively in defining the tumor margins or identifying functionally important brain areas .    2.149677550024348
the different localization techniques employed are articulated position - sensing arms , infrared or ultrasound systems working with the principle of satellite navigation and robotic systems integrated with the operating microscope .    1.8948945547537304
in 200 operations performed with different systems ( arm - based , robotic and infrared ) the method proved to be helpful , enabling fewer invasive procedures to be performed .    2.111195122570833
with a mean deviation of 2 . 87 + / - 1 . 9 mm for intraoperative localization , the accuracy was only slightly worse than in frame - based stereotaxy with deviations below 2 mm .    2.549709551326133
neuronavigation was most helpful for operations on deeply seated lesions , skull - base tumors and lesions in brain areas with high functionality .    2.010203077838005
the major disadvantage is the use of preoperative data for navigation , leading to UNK when anatomical structures are altered during the operation by resection of tumors or shift of intracranial soft tissue .    2.4403389963857096
intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) might be a solution for this problem .    2.4047833211198015
therefore , neuronavigation is definitely a method with growing importance in operative routine , and it will also spread into other surgical specialties .    2.0745514269419725
severe pain of mucositis induced by cytostatic conditioning therapy in bone marrow transplantation ( bmt ) patients generally requires continuous parenteral opioid treatment .    2.047699169337794
the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of continuous morphine in mucositis pain and the side - effects in bmt patients .    2.401221280347098
particular emphasis was placed on the question of whether reaction times , which are usually measured to estimate opioid effects upon vigilance , are influenced by pain - induced cognitive impairments in pain patients .    2.2664155665698837
methods while in hospital , 10 bmt patients were examined daily with the aid of a mucositis scale , subjective visual analog scales ( vas ) for pain and mood parameters , a german version of the UNK pain questionnaire ( mpq ) , and a mental performance task battery , and the morphine given was documented .    2.5190155764257276
mental performance tests were simple auditory reaction time and choice reaction time .    2.357295764467179
seven patients also performed a sternberg memory search test in which they had to use ' yes ' and ' no ' response keys to UNK visually presented test letters to a previously UNK set of letters .    1.8795125719088102
practice and baseline data were collected within the first week before bmt .    2.9197924102937516
results the intensity and duration of mucositis differed from patient to patient , resulting in different pain intensities and mpq scores .    2.310102547604388
prolongation of the choice reaction time averaged over the period of mucositis treatment correlated significantly with residual pain intensity ( spearman rs = 0 . 88 , p < 0 . 01 ) but not with morphine dose ( rs = 0 . 35 , p = 0 . 33 ) .    2.456688264047372
for the sternberg memory search test greater correlation coefficients resulted between reaction time and morphine dose ( rs = 0 . 86 , p = 0 . UNK ) than between reaction time and residual pain intensity ( rs = 0 . 61 , p = 0 . 15 ) .    2.3084391487433047
conclusions it is concluded that both pain and morphine can impair cognitive performance , but that these mental stressors seem to differ according to qualitative criteria .    2.102688146447225
whereas pain might slow reaction time by UNK a patient ' s attention , particularly in low mental demand tasks , morphine could interfere with more specific cognitive processes , such as short - term memory operations , that are required in more complex tasks .    2.3780986909506
the case of a 63 - year - old man with a widespread retroperitoneal tumor and two tumor nodules in the left testis is described .    2.444750379381757
histopathological and UNK examination of tissue from the retroperitoneal tumor led to a diagnosis of UNK neoplasia .    2.8735068029776007
the patient died in acute cardiac failure , five weeks after initial presentation .    2.2698423605495206
autopsy revealed another tumor nodule in the right atrium .    2.668192287870686
macroscopically , the bone marrow appeared normal .    3.098073024026281
the tumor cells were reactive for UNK , vimentin and UNK esterase , but were unreactive with a broad spectrum of antibodies against UNK and lymphocytic antigens and antibodies against tryptase and c - kit ( UNK ) , characteristic markers for mast cells .    2.340852815293115
however , the bone marrow exhibited the typical picture of mastocytosis .    2.6565235994453698
a diagnosis of bone marrow mastocytosis with an associated secondary UNK mast cell sarcoma was established .    2.292107709646913
the cause of death was heart failure due to arrhythmia caused by an exophytic UNK tumor nodule .    2.487618974824869
thrombembolic events as paraneoplastic complications in malignant disease account for severe morbidity and mortality in these patients .    2.383159125337663
in some cases disturbance in hemostasis is the first manifestation of a neoplastic process .    2.739040741721289
we report the cases of two patients with cerebral and extracerebral vessel occlusions , in whom epithelial tumors of low malignant potential ( borderline - tumors ) of UNK and peritoneum were diagnosed later on .    2.392410292751512
in one case the removal of the tumor stopped the coagulation problems .    2.8366482353671665
the second patient died a few days after the first symptoms with devastating multiple vessel occlusion .    2.693362001677132
in stroke of unknown aetiology a paraneoplastic process should be kept in mind .    2.2148087025325904
the diagnosis is more probable with recurrent thrombembolism in different body regions and when UNK therapie was ineffective .    1.9707407433114834
UNK coagulation studies and a tumor search program is recommended in these cases .    2.6270917637062965
brain - stem gliomas occur mainly in childhood and are localized in the UNK , pons and UNK UNK .    2.994409988181241
diagnosis is a domain of mri , requiring t2 , t1 and km .    2.2732053104607908
ct shows hemorrhage and calcification well .    2.493212970733313
the criteria are the primary site , size , tumor growth , brain - stem enlargement , delineation , intralesional structure , exophytic components and enhancement .    2.094639466195988
secondary criteria are herniation , hydrocephalus and UNK seeding .    2.294221772094477
in ct glioma are hypodense , in mri UNK in t2 and UNK in t1 .    2.3380220521499466
enhancement is seen in 25 - 60 % and does not allow differentiation of tumor vs nontumor or UNK .    2.4301108979869652
factors influencing poor outcome are high grade , a short history , cranial nerve involvement , severe brain - stem enlargement , pontine site , diffuse growth and UNK .    2.0417820330081544
the 5 - year - survival rate is 30 % ( after radiation : focal tumors 85 % , diffuse 20 % ) .    2.370557102057503
most frequent are symptoms of brain pressure , cerebellum , cranial nerves and pyramidal tract .    2.1414743198384785
there is no agreement on whether biopsy is necessary or not .    2.2408461705402742
a diagnosis of tumor is highly suggestive if classical mri findings fit the clinical history .    2.211014434775293
radiobiological and physical examinations suggest clinical advantages of heavy ion irradiation .    2.2122464710503182
we report the result of 23 women and 22 men ( median age 48 years ) with skull base tumors irradiated with carbon ion beams at the gesellschaft für UNK ( UNK ) , darmstadt , from december 1997 until september 1999 .    2.2757858176233015
the study included patients with chordomas ( 17 ) , chondrosarcomas ( 10 ) and other skull base tumors ( table 1 ) .    2.125805103808182
it is the first time that the intensity - controlled UNK - technique and the application of positron - emission tomography ( pet ) for quality assurance was used .    2.6228633033500843
all patients had computed tomography for three - dimensional - treatment planning ( figure 1 ) .    2.4204071371257996
patients with chordomas and chondrosarcomas underwent fractionated carbon ion irradiation in 20 consecutive days ( median total dose 60 gye ) .    1.9735008396270448
other UNK were treated with carbon ion boost of 15 to 18 gye delivered to the UNK tumor after fractionated UNK radiotherapy ( median total dose 63 gye ) .    2.3704945698280193
mean follow - up was 9 months .    3.1651535683509153
irradiation was well tolerated by all patients .    2.8955645027519026
partial tumor remission was seen in 7 patients ( 15 , 5 % ) ( figure 2 ) .    3.1786826260409886
one - year local control rate was 94 % .    2.5550573320309553
one patient ( 2 , 2 % ) deceased .    3.505868165277145
no severe toxicity and no local recurrence within the treated volume were observed .    2.3417410660796216
clinical effectiveness and technical feasibility of this modality could clearly be demonstrated in our study .    2.7680022772573
to evaluate the clinical relevance of the different beam modalities studies with larger patient numbers are necessary .    2.553905040298385
to continue our project a new heavy ion UNK exclusively for clinical use is UNK to be constructed in heidelberg .    2.192592983601293
indirect trauma to the shoulder and knee joint often results in injuries to the ligaments and the capsule , and more rarely in fractures .    2.3991323233211905
anterior shoulder dislocation is common .    2.8976511276224466
over the last few years arthroscopic repair of the torn labrum has become established as the therapy of choice .    2.527486279332497
isolated ruptures of the collateral ligaments of the knee can be treated functionally .    3.295959317664423
a torn anterior cruciate ligament of the knee joint can be compensated by the quadriceps muscle if this is adequately prepared by special exercises .    2.5707798231455956
chronic or combined instabilities should be treated surgically by UNK grafting techniques .    2.589887297419544
menisceal injuries are treated arthroscopically .    2.8559521334656504
objective : comparison of low back pain ( lbp ) patients with and without fibromyalgia syndrome ( fms ) with regard to affective distress .    2.5018773211658543
methods : patients with lbp who had been admitted to various clinics in germany were examined upon admission .    2.20014456489559
comparisons were done by dividing the patients into groups with and without signs of fms .    2.5190049666618957
additionally , both groups were compared after being matched according to sex , age , and pain severity .    2.5085998085640147
results : 15 out of 135 lbp patients met the american college of rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia .    1.9627435972854486
patients with fms showed remarkably higher levels of pain severity and affective distress .    2.236939697325119
after controlling for different levels of pain severity , these pronounced differences disappeared .    2.340087086974083
methods : cases of invasive hi - infections were reported in a national active surveillance program .    2.2214078682902056
the case definition required the typical clinical picture and a hi positive culture from a physiologically sterile site ( or throat swab or tracheal UNK in case of epiglottitis or pneumonia ) in children up to 10 years .    2.189566718552091
all initial reports were validated with a questionnaire that additionally questioned the vaccination status , type of vaccine , therapy , outcome of the disease and characteristics of the bacteria .    2.613838167139968
the relation between the type of UNK vaccine used on the risk of infection was analysed in a case control study with controls selected at random from a population based sampling frame .    2.4574999534378685
results : 310 confirmed cases of invasive hi infections were reported during the observation period , 199 of these with meningitis , 56 with epiglottitis .    2.095278788603085
the number of cases declined from 71 in the last six months of 1992 , 120 in 1993 , and 65 in 1994 to 54 cases in 1995 .    2.2937651640520373
in 1995 the incidence in up to 5 year old children was 1 . 1 / 100 000 for all infection sites and 0 . 7 / 100 000 for meningitis .    2.723077828199644
the reduced rates were mainly due to a decrease in the number of UNK cases , whereas the number of cases in vaccinated children UNK between 22 and 36 per year .    3.117116468653087
most of these were observed in incompletely vaccinated children , who according to the german recommendations could already have received at least one further vaccination at the time of the infection .    2.7166824034939103
the type of vaccine ( UNK , UNK - d or UNK ) was not significantly associated with the risk of infection in vaccinated children .    4.0652645633656395
10 % of the bacteria produced UNK .    4.003176484304539
in accordance with the german recommendations third generation UNK were used in almost all cases of meningitis .    2.8102558217641054
one third of these , however , received additional antibiotics .    3.4424540389132914
conclusions : the present incidence of systemic hi infections in germany is low .    2.606892718945262
a further decrease , however , would be possible with " on time " completion of the vaccination schedule according to the german recommendations in all children .    2.6350148545861782
for more than a century peritoneal adhesions are being recognized as frequent sequelae following abdominal surgery .    2.2959335040303026
the global increase of life expectancy and surgical procedures are leading to rising incidences of adhesion - related complications and subsequent socio - economic implications .    2.265193433281719
as of today , there is no safe and efficient prophylaxis available .    2.7945575133395124
scientific efforts should be aimed at a liquid substance for single intraperitoneal application which significantly reduces postoperative adhesions at reasonable cost without adverse effects on blood coagulation and wound healing .    1.8814901700295779
even today the name of f . d . von recklinghausen is often mentioned in connection with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism .    2.2430757645322443
he was one of the first physicians and scientists to render outstanding services to the classification of structural changes of bones , and in many aspects his work remains valid today .    2.5640861652854614
he succeeded through precise and comparative studies in making the disease and symptoms of primary hyperparathyroidism known and thus distinguishing it from other known structural bone diseases .    2.1576191839179093
he also described the phenomenon of " bone remodeling " which has become relevant today again .    2.1503605797983214
although his written macroscopic and microscopic observations include UNK precise UNK which make it difficult to study them today , they are still of interest in order to follow his basic ideas .    2.207577642410951
this article does not constitute a comprehensive biography , but it contains a description of f . d . von recklinghausen ' s important work on bone pathology against the background of the main stages of his life .    2.1065138782521684
soft - tissue sarcomas ( sts ) of the extremities are characterized by a high rate of local recurrences .    3.4273281068861166
limb salvage approaches using multimodality therapy protocols have replaced amputation .    2.185923431209157
in order to evaluate isolated UNK limb perfusion ( ilp ) in a multimodality therapy concept , we reviewed our patients treated using this method .    2.17312289492274
between january 1982 and december 1995 , 25 UNK , using cisplatin , melphalan and adriamycin , were performed in 22 patients with sts .    2.3220546219004126
forty percent were treated for local recurrences ; histology was dominated by malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( mfh ) and synovial sarcoma .    1.9791379999382923
in all , 68 % of the sts were classified as uicc stage iib or iiia / b .    2.7052177010971845
most of the cases ( 14 ) underwent wide or radical resection , 4 patients received intraoperative radiotherapy , and 5 were treated with external beam radiation .    2.743635855152427
complications were recorded in 32 % of the cases .    3.1666345249082406
with a median follow - up of 45 months ( range 1 - 143 ) , the 5 - year overall survival rate was 81 % .    3.101579350266181
the median recurrence - free time was 19 months and the 5 - year disease - free survival rate 34 % .    2.4993776001519032
there were 13 local failures , and distant metastases developed in 36 % of the patients .    2.384165817539471
concerning high - grade sarcomas ( uicc stage iib , iiia / b ) , we found local recurrences in 75 % of all cases .    3.1056465638319057
five of 11 patients with local failures underwent perfusion after they refused amputation , and 7 incompletely resected sts received ilp without reoperation .    2.0026532481589765
all of these demonstrated local recurrence .    2.7886936425613347
this rate of local recurrence proved to be different from patients with tumor - free resection margins ( p = 0 . 0001 , log - rank test ) .    2.672859457329942
the amputation rate after isolated limb perfusion was 27 % ( mean 11 months after treatment ) .    2.382504455197068
long - term results of ilp showed a considerable local recurrence rate and a low disease - free survival .    2.582902612150302
perfusion in patients without tumor - free resection margins does not prevent local recurrence .    2.6032241263245863
we conclude that ilp with cisplatin , melphalan and adriamycin should be considered carefully and is not an additional treatment strategy of first choice .    2.3833799540575606
we report about two healthy children with pseudomembranous colitis caused by clostridium difficile without an underlying illness or a former history of antibiotic treatment .    1.8350968673613057
huntington ' s disease ( hd ) may cause considerable diagnostic problems because of the highly variable clinical features , especially at the beginning of the illness .    2.7805235255587295
we report the case of a 21 - year - old woman with definite hd whose main symptoms were psychopathological changes that were misinterpreted as schizophrenia for 7 years .    1.9904138439131667
one reason for this misdiagnosis was the unusual , very early onset and the remarkable earlier age of onset of hd compared with that of other affected relatives .    2.030084758846992
the phenomenon of earlier onset within one affected family is well documented in the literature in cases with the UNK transmitted mutated gene .    2.79546283033845
diagnostic landmarks were consideration of the initially mild disturbances of movement and the once again repeated detailed examination of the family history .    2.5706988874585877
icd - 10 is to be implemented for morbidity coding in germany soon .    2.6443437342745146
for everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by dimdi : icd - 10 meta files , icd conversion tables , icd - 10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms .    1.690150182009667
all files are available free of charge via the internet .    2.015289513538005
because of poorly UNK UNK soft tissues , total UNK claviculectomy in cases of UNK with cortical destruction is always marginal .    2.4678370378001304
due to different muscular compensation in the patients examined , literature UNK on the biomechanical consequences of claviculectomy for the shoulder girdle .    2.3806922195294677
thrombolytic therapy of pulmonary embolism with recombinant tissue - type plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) has proved to be an established method ; but intra - and postoperatively , there is a high risk of bleeding complications .    3.0386123478176796
a 50 - year old female with familiar UNK and suspected deep venous thrombosis was undergoing osteosynthesis of a femoral fracture .    2.280370723473227
intraoperatively , UNK suddenly dropped , paco2 rose , and circulatory arrest occurred .    2.1552472901066415
cpr was started immediately with closed - chest cardiac compression and intravenous application of catecholamines .    2.2989724102143567
while continuing cpr , surgery was stopped , the wound was sealed UNK , and the patient was transferred to the icu .    2.8231214824679736
because of suspected massive pulmonary embolism , thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa in a total dosage of 100 mg was begun .    2.344792810398429
2 . 25 hours after the onset of UNK arrest , and 1 . 5 hours after the beginning of thrombolysis , the patient ' s hemodynamic patterns under high - dosage catecholamines were satisfactory .    2.845710206084464
the bleeding after thrombolysis and coagulopathy required massive blood transfusions .    2.187192317139305
the situation was also complicated by lesions of the liver , spleen and small intestines , which required surgical intervention , and acute renal failure , which had to be treated with transient hemofiltration .    2.656095636283875
twenty - eight days after receiving cpr , the patient was discharged from the icu .    2.655188620986081
a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism was established by clinical signs , capnometry , blood gas analysis , and electrocardiography .    2.6655497472724243
due to the requirements of the emergency situation ( ongoing cpr ) , further diagnostic tools were not used .    2.599333412957636
the patient survived without any neurological deficiency , despite the extended 135 - min use of cpr , and despite massive bleeding due to surgical trauma , and to performing cpr in the presence of UNK .    2.3740335602166245
with the increasing use of cross - sectional echocardiography in patients with overt or suspected pulmonary thromboembolism in the emergency rooms , more and more right atrial thrombi are detected .    2.5458421568381033
these are so - called " UNK " from the venous system on their way to the pulmonary arteries and they are a severe presentation of thromboembolic disease .    2.5122421327825575
they appear as an imminent pulmonary embolism and usually UNK with an already massive embolism .    2.496404122147963
in patients were a right atrial thrombus is associated with a patent foramen ovale , paradoxical arterial embolism has been observed .    2.381636423729729
right sided heart thrombi have a high mortality rate and need immediate treatment .    2.4585726064338536
in our hospital we have seen 14 patients with right atrial thrombi and pulmonary embolism in a period of 6 years .    2.7786495386845758
three patients had cardiac arrest with a massive pulmonary embolism , seven patients presented with a UNK embolism .    2.8408648378496864
all patients were treated immediately after echocardiographic diagnosis without pulmonary angiography .    2.376717145514338
in about half of the cases transesophageal echocardiography was done additionally for diagnosis and monitoring .    2.882830777567728
therapeutic options were thrombectomy , fibrinolysis or anticoagulants .    2.314893407633475
we treated one of our patients with thrombectomy , eleven patients with fibrinolysis and two patients with anticoagulants .    2.626211540124645
the era of modern anaesthesia in germany began on january UNK , 1847 .    2.310765503589571
this day , professor in ordinary johann ferdinand heyfelder UNK a patient with sulphuric ether in the clinic of surgery and ophthalmology of the university of erlangen .    2.471822655477262
by march 17th , 1847 , heyfelder had performed 121 surgical procedures under ether .    2.1101561499071804
the operations in majority were teeth - extractions , and a few more complex operations such as the treatment of a UNK or of lip cancer or the resection of the shoulder joint .    3.0499995882292255
heyfelder described in detail 108 of these inhalations in a little book entitled the experiments with sulphuric ether .    2.101633364589746
this UNK published in march , 1847 , represents one of the first complete UNK on sulphuric ether in the german literature .    2.594724917229747
in a special chapter he analyzed the development of various physiological and psychological parameters during UNK .    2.53055422235333
heyfelder also examined blood and urine of some UNK patients and reported that he did not find any important or specific alterations .    2.132715118268298
in 1847 , heyfelder was probably the first to apply salt - ether in man .    2.2394638600858356
after 4 administrations he concluded that salt ether acted more quickly but shorter than sulphuric ether .    1.9421772895693326
advantageous were its application without problems and ease of induction .    2.37672701902517
disadvantageous were its high UNK , its price and the difficulty of getting it in a pure form .    2.1815357348863835
from december , 1847 , on heyfelder started to use chloroform .    2.3064164346703615
he was now able to perform more major operations , for example the total resection of the hip - joint .    2.817161489266266
in his book the experiments with sulphuric ether , salt ether , and chloroform he describes a great number of anaesthetic administrations using these 3 agents .    1.9072160292786817
in his summary heyfelder concluded , that chloroform was UNK superior to sulphuric ether mainly because it was a quicker acting and longer lasting agent and leads to deeper UNK .    1.9386371371864755
moreover its application was much easier for it needed no special apparatus .    2.1069835622737525
however , because of its great anaesthetic potency , heyfelder particularly demanded great caution in the application of chloroform .    2.41835026972516
UNK he expected an assistant for UNK , whose only duty was to UNK the inhalations and the patient - a UNK of the modern specialized anaesthesiologist .    3.024794996696785
background : to evaluate the publication rate of abstracts presented during the german anaesthesia UNK ( UNK ) in medline - listed journals in comparison to the publication rate of abstracts presented during the meeting of the european society of anaesthesiologists ( UNK ) .    2.2988384705607805
the uniform development of the human embryo , as described by classic human embryology , has been confirmed by UNK studies .    2.9464237536368625
in particular , the embryonic brain is suitable for transvaginal ultrasound examination , because the large " cystic " cavities of the brain can easily be imaged .    2.3393144571062665
sonoembryology not only describes normal embryonic anatomy and normal relations and proportions of organs , but also the development of structural abnormalities .    2.6265849695429218
based on normal sonoembryology and on recent experiences with early cns anomalies , we recognize some sonographic signs of an early cns anomaly : ( 1 ) apparent UNK of the brain or the head ; ( 2 ) altered appearance of the cerebral ventricles with UNK of the brain compartments , where the amount of fluid is either greater or less than normal ; ( 3 ) in the early fetal period , choroid UNK that are too small to fill the ventricle from the medial to the lateral wall ; ( 4 ) irregular contour of the spine / back ; ( 5 ) extra - cns anomalies .    2.4275968381586166
in the following survey , normal sonoembryology of the cns is described , and cns anomalies of the early pregnancy are discussed .    2.454545275784489
telomerase is an enzyme that UNK UNK repeats , the specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that provide genomic stability and compensate for the physiologic process of UNK shortening .    2.0561786148107757
it has been implicated in cellular senescence , UNK , and carcinogenesis .    3.1247667472583665
over 85 % of human tumours , and 95 % of non - melanocytic skin cancers , show telomerase activity , in contrast to the corresponding normal tissues .    2.642174683159641
this suggests that telomerase activity may play an important role in carcinogenesis .    2.415621241266932
recent evidence shows that telomerase is active not only in embryonal and germ line tissues , but also in some normal tissues .    2.2805667689323936
in the skin , this activity has been UNK to the stem - cell - bearing epidermal basal cell layer , possibly reflecting the presence of telomerase - competent stem cells .    2.617228583806974
these findings require a reconsideration of our interpretation of telomerase activity in tumours of the skin and other tissues .    2.406105433123581
as a causal relationship linking telomerase activity and cancer has yet not been demonstrated , some caution is warranted .    1.9888858879851485
the established criteria of auditory brainstem responses ( abr ) such as UNK latency , UNK - v interpeak latency and UNK differences of latency or amplitude have been found to be sensitive for detecting tumors of the cerebellopontine angle if a response is present .    2.3527916922404253
however , the abr can be absent in cases of acoustic neuromas because of desynchronization , even though pure - one audiometry indicates that responses should be present .    2.137382631986771
this retrospective study compared the abr and pure - tone thresholds in UNK cases with cerebellopontine angle tumors and a control group of 181 cases with sensory hearing losses in order to quantify threshold discrepancies .    2.481036161655232
the average deficit of the objective abr threshold ( UNK ) to the subjective pure - tone threshold for those frequencies between 1 - 6 khz was 3 . 6 db for the control group ( abr and pure tone thresholds very close ) and 31 . 2 db for the tumor group ( abr threshold much higher than the pure - tone threshold ) .    2.40308184614044
abr thresholds 30 db higher than the high - frequency pure tone thresholds were found in 40 . 6 % of the tumor group and in none of the control group .    3.5073097118168555
thus , deficits of the abr threshold > 30 db can be considered to be an additional criterion for detecting UNK disease and increases abr sensitivity for tumor detection even if responses are absent .    2.276226765191339
the association of nevus flammeus with mongolian spot , nevus fuscoceruleus , nevus UNK and , with variable frequency , with nevus UNK has been termed phacomatosis pigmentovascularis , a genodermatosis first described by ota and co - workers .    2.0628086027061516
four different combinations have been specified .    2.653367234613286
most cases are reported from the UNK literature .    3.2232976922669954
phacomatosis pigmentovascularis may constitute an exclusively cutaneous disorder , but overlapping with other syndromes like UNK - UNK syndrome or UNK - weber syndrome is also possible .    2.3752586684489114
we report a 30 - year - old woman with nevus flammeus on the back and right arm associated with nevus fuscoceruleus on the back .    2.293602639694689
orif management of unstable trochanteric fractures of type a3 of the UNK classification is difficult because of lateral dislocation of the proximal fractured segments , particularly when only the sliding hip - screw is used for fixation .    2.6019248101283594
a connectable UNK - press plate was recently developed in order to prevent this type of dislocation .    2.6952331775414735
we review the results with this fixation technique in 22 elderly patients with an average age of 76 years who presented with highly unstable trochanteric fracture of the a3 type .    2.570916622818227
three patients died of diseases unrelated to the trauma or operation before the fractures had healed .    2.298871819354705
the other 19 were followed prospectively until fracture healing had occurred .    2.1993917707945476
complaints , leg shortening and changes in the ccd angle were recorded .    2.7602295474374623
furthermore , the mobility score was determined .    2.527652368965457
although the patients were able to bear full weight after the operation , no lateral dislocation of fragments was observed .    2.767172023235344
only 1 patient had a varus dislocation of 5 ° until the fracture had consolidated .    2.545971349641607
no pseudarthrosis , osteitis or rotational malalignment was noted .    2.239602745852041
five of the surviving patients had a lower mobility score after fracture healing as compared to the status before the fracture was sustained .    2.5672151931059974
on the basis of this review , we recommend the use of this new connectable UNK plate with sliding hip screws because it provides UNK fixation of highly unstable fractures of type a3 .    2.6375528753082933
superficial leptomeningeal hemosiderosis is a rare disease of the central nervous system .    3.0486446745526794
chronic bleeding into the subarachnoid space causes deposition of UNK in glial cells and subsequent damage to adjacent brain tissue .    2.1920553468768196
there is a characteristic predilection for the cerebellum and eighth cranial nerve .    2.3768596097749515
accordingly , among a variety of symptoms , cerebellar ataxia and sensorineural hearing loss progressing to total deafness commonly occur .    2.398703961452328
to date , the hearing loss has been believed to be purely neural .    2.249277084892246
we present a case of superficial hemosiderosis in a patient with total deafness who was successfully provided with a cochlear implant .    2.574638692931924
audiometry demonstrated total bilateral cochlear hearing losses but with preserved function of the eighth cranial nerve .    2.2406694470616726
these findings make us conclude that in contrast to current opinion , superficial hemosiderosis can initially damage the cochlea alone .    2.2330721256483317
thus , patients with total deafness due to this disorder may benefit from cochlear implantation .    2.660277307158325
all patients require careful UNK assessment , including UNK stimulation .    2.4566757711046754
intracardiac masses remain a challenge for imaging diagnosis .    2.6002878587100904
features and limitations of these two imaging techniques are illustrated and briefly analyzed .    2.7335024384839914
for the first time , the present study assessed the achievable predictive value of early self - experienced neuropsychological deficits for the UNK development of schizophrenia .    2.6286287826682666
after an average follow - up period of about 8 years , more than half of the re - examined sample had developed a schizophrenic disorder according to dsm - iii - r .    2.581707968758915
the outcome of schizophrenia versus no schizophrenia was predicted correctly in 77 % of cases by the presence or absence of self - experienced disturbances of perception , thought , speech or action .    2.3225855771262256
a 3 - bp deletion in the UNK gene causes early onset , generalized torsion dystonia ( td ) , and mutations in the UNK UNK i and the tyrosine hydroxylase genes result in UNK - responsive dystonia ( UNK ) .    2.7946976794138427
a UNK change in the d2 dopamine receptor in one large family ( UNK ) has recently been implicated in myoclonus - dystonia .    2.5874873364337594
furthermore , seven other loci for dystonia genes have been mapped to chromosomal regions , including a locus for a mixed dystonia phenotype ( UNK ) , one form of focal dystonia ( UNK ) , three types of paroxysmal dystonia ( UNK - 10 ) , x - linked dystonia - parkinsonism ( UNK ) , and rapid - onset dystonia - parkinsonism ( UNK ) .    2.5933039311373567
no positive linkage results have yet been obtained for autosomal recessive td ( UNK ) and several other families of different types of dominantly inherited td ( UNK ) .    2.3619186110698704
in addition , hereditary secondary dystonia may occur as part of familial diseases of the basal ganglia , metabolic and storage disorders , and various x - linked and other familial neurodegenerative syndromes affecting the basal ganglia .    2.2011919122049526
it may be anticipated that the traditional clinical and etiological classifications of dystonia will increasingly be replaced by a genetic one and that the identification of more dystonia genes may lead to a better understanding of these largely UNK disorders .    2.2965128919995332
in this study we investigated whether , in conjunction with neuroleptics , a psychoeducational and cognitively oriented treatment for schizophrenic outpatients and their key - persons can improve the course of schizophrenic illness within a 2 - year follow - up .    2.2180803990779503
this prospective randomized study covered a total of 191 schizophrenic patients ( according to dsm - iii - r ) and comprised a psychoeducational training and cognitive psychotherapy for patients and counseling for their key persons in various combinations .    2.258430806938387
patients were examined before , immediately after and 2 years after the end of the intervention .    3.018906949443319
patients in the treatment groups reduced their overall psychopathology and their attention deficit .    2.802652647431857
for patients receiving all three treatment conditions , there was a relevant preventive effect with regard to the UNK rate appearing during the second year of the follow - up .    2.6679615474422107
we conclude that in the mid - term , a combination of psychoeducational and cognitively oriented therapy for patients and their UNK can improve the course of schizophrenic illness .    2.8965640664818575
background : cigarette smoking is common during pregnancy and can UNK the developing fetus to UNK UNK , but relatively little information is available on fetal uptake of such compounds .    2.402448646129187
it was the aim of the present study to analyze the first urine of newborns of mothers who did or did not smoke for metabolites of the tobacco - specific UNK 4 - ( UNK ) - 1 - ( 3 - UNK ) - 1 - UNK ( UNK ) as well as nicotine and UNK .    3.026463334505611
recently there has been an increase in the prevalent hiv infected population in germany because of UNK in progression to aids and death while the number of newly infected patients remains constant . this increases the potential value of both current and new approaches to disease prevention .    2.2967745773018313
post exposure prophylaxis ( pep ) , defined as treatment of a person who has been exposed to an hiv infected person by a route through which transmission is possible , is one possible way to decrease the number of new cases .    2.3825660455167315
economic evaluation can help to answer the question whether pep should be provided to different exposed populations or whether the resources that would be used for pep should be used for other hiv prevention or treatment interventions . the value of pep depends both on the costs and effectiveness of the intervention .    2.3845587727390356
in this paper , we use examples from the literature to demonstrate the cost effectiveness of pep in different population subgroups , including those occupationally exposed , those exposed through unprotected sex , and those exposed through iv drug use .    2.0861530409377034
the cost - effectiveness of pep is also compared to literature estimates of the cost - effectiveness of other prevention activities .    2.3028801459911157
the aim of this study was to access the importance of the laparoscopic colorectal resection .    2.3166083188384783
of 131 patients 80 were operated on laparoscopically .    2.67854795180561
the conversion rate was 14 % ( 13 / 93 ) .    2.4052017411659516
a total of 47 patients suffered from cancer .    2.838209222562779
curative resection was performed in 41 patients ( 87 % ) .    3.007372557665476
for comparison , 48 patients who underwent open resection were used .    2.7510586322891135
the complication rate was lower after laparoscopy and no reoperation was performed .    2.213899626472479
patients recovered quicker and their first oral food intake and bowel movement were earlier .    2.0814239047324525
hospital stay was shorter ( 15 . 3 vs . 8 . 1 days ) , and pain at rest and in motion was significantly reduced .    3.1918910020112765
equal numbers of mesenteric lymph nodes were retrieved ; adequate margins of resection could be obtained and the length of resected bowel did not differ .    2.279796405908538
no port metastases were observed .    2.7288228949505804
reduced morbidity , reduced hospital stay , reduced abdominal pain , quicker UNK , and reduced overall health care costs are strong arguments in favor of laparoscopic colectomy .    2.5334111011692313
in the field of traumatology , compartment syndromes of the lower extremity are often seen after fractures and direct injuries , or after ischaemia .    2.3613359541744745
other causes include over - exertion and non - traumatic causes such as acute UNK , drug - induced myositis and eosinophilic myositis .    2.483474696320477
this paper describes the clinical and mr course of a compartment syndrome following an ankle UNK .    2.665935075608732
each patient has the right of a dedicated pain therapy according to the state of the art .    2.925107972590607
however an efficient pain therapy is not possible without knowing the cause of pain .    2.9293592842591796
in most posttraumatic pain situations peripheral nociceptors are activated and normal afferences are conducted via an intact nociceptive system .    1.8609552924021673
in contrast , neuropathic pain pain is caused by lesions of the nervous system itself .    2.7424251049259407
mechanisms of central sensibilization and involvement of the sympathetic nervous system may lead to chronification of such pain conditions .    2.4342125540061055
apart from classic non - opioid analgesics , co - analgesics and opioids have an important status in chronic pain management as well .    2.229278793110464
prescription of these substances has to follow strictly defined standards of pain therapy .    2.4069685878187865
blockades with local anaesthetics as mono - therapy of chronic pain are obsolete .    2.587805560754374
in posttraumatic pain , however , a certain number of adjuvant blockades or infiltrations of UNK may be helpful .    2.7650934798585243
the UNK place of sympathetic blockades are in diagnosis and therapy of sympathetic maintained pain ( smp ) .    2.243260004697677
effects of 94 different psychosocial and psychotherapeutic interventions on well - being in the elderly were meta - analyzed .    2.3142362435285464
psychological well - being was improved and self - rated depression decreased for about half a standard deviation .    2.557851674229248
the mean effect size for other - rated depression reached d = 1 . 15 .    2.3809427811303707
whereas age of participants did not correlate with change in self - rated well - being or depression , other - rated depression improved less in older samples .    2.130503166226035
high effect sizes derived from control - enhancing interventions and behavior therapy .    2.1551480257570153
sub - analyses showed that individual setting produced higher improvement than group setting .    2.118435958658498
higher " therapeutic " qualifications and interventions in nursing homes were associated with higher effect - sizes too .    2.073315812662927
implications for planning UNK in old age are discussed .    2.6544692426277097
the prognosis of laryngeal carcinoma worsens dramatically with the discovery of primary or secondary lymph node metastases .    2.5043857749607064
thus consistent prophylaxis and therapy of metastases is indispensable .    2.817303173249581
the standard therapy of manifest cervical lymph node metastases is surgery , if possible using the approach of conservative neck dissection .    2.4698146432623216
in cases of a lymph node stage n3 , i . e .    2.5297413556347577
fixated metastases with a diameter greater than 6 cm , individually adapted therapy in necessary because of the extremely poor prognosis .    2.477132617693833
objective : the german ophthalmologic society is rising to the challenges of the information age by offering comprehensive information resources online .    1.9248123209947035
human recombinant interleukin 2 ( il - 2 ) , alone or in combination with other cytokines , is currently under investigation for the immunotherapy of metastatic tumours .    2.471159696572003
objective responses of 20 % - 35 % have been reported in patients with disseminated melanoma and renal cell carcinoma who received high - dose intravenous il - 2 in combination with interferon - ( ifn ) .    3.1410947231707094
however , treatment with il - 2 is complicated by a syndrome of life - threatening adverse reactions such as disseminated vascular leakage , fluid retention , severe hypotension , and ( reversible ) multiple organ dysfunction ( mods ) .    2.385035999055035
a systemic inflammatory reaction ( sirs ) / sepsis sepsis - like haemodynamic pattern has been described in patients after il - 2 bolus application alone .    2.504006038446732
our purpose was to study the haemodynamic changes in patients treated with high - dose il - 2 administered as a constant infusion and in combination with ifn .    2.8878050963865345
the histopathologic diagnosis of odontogenic cysts is based mainly on the morphological nature of the epithelial lining of cysts and their origin .    2.3362888076745882
we used the international histologic classification set up by the world health organisation in 1992 .    2.223975897022491
the aim of this study was to investigate the differentiation of various types of cyst using an immunohistochemical technique rather than by conventional morphological assessment .    2.0767067509478054
about five per cent of the children with congenital diaphragmatic hernia are asymptomatic during parturition and are diagnosed beyond the neonatal period .    2.1465825419029034
we report about particularities of " late - UNK " with congenital diaphragmatic hernias namely funnel chest and a fatal outcome of an associated acute gastric volvulus .    2.053506372892935
the retrospective results of carbon prostheses for knee ligament reconstruction in 120 patients , as established by questionnaire , are reported at 10 + / - 2 years follow - up .    2.412288908655746
eighty patients could also be reviewed clinically .    2.526754204359716
some 60 % of the patients showed good subjective function at reduced activity level .    2.81163212682334
complications were seen in 72 . 5 % of the patients with rupture of the carbon prosthesis and in 68 % of those with synovitis .    3.3822752259439692
x - ray showed osteoarthritis in up to 59 % of the patients .    2.854867978697761
carbon prostheses for collateral ligament reconstruction ( 85 % medial , 5 . 8 % lateral ) were successful in 75 % of cases .    2.666135674310102
activity and time seem to be less responsible for failure of the carbon prostheses than the features of growing in .    2.504507061970794
destruction of the knee joint over time is due to reactive synovitis and catabolic enzyme reaction and correlates with joint effusion and pain .    2.5001129909237614
if these problems appear , ( arthroscopic ) resection of the UNK is indicated to interrupt the UNK UNK .    2.905676584104924
background : with UNK to very early screening it has become necessary to apply laboratory techniques more sensitive and more precise than the formerly used UNK - test to guarantee correct detection of UNK .    2.1335427501230457
three quantitative methods were compared .    2.6623244948213194
the UNK medical school played an important role in the development of radiological examinations and signs of the temporal bone with conventional x - rays .    2.897279502556085
famous UNK include e . g . UNK ( 1893 - 1969 ) and l . UNK ( 1910 - 1986 ) .    2.470644382231214
nowadays conventional x - rays and tomography have lost their important role in diagnostic radiology of the temporal bone , but the basic principles established in those early years of radiology are still used now .    2.3287356212657686
this statement is correct not only for conventional x - rays , but particularly for " poly " - tomography in comparison with ct .    2.309864700881616
the success of interventional catheter based therapy of coronary artery disease is still limited by a high rate of chronic restenosis .    2.715962742908086
using alternative mechanical techniques , there is increasing evidence that restenosis can be prevented in certain subsets of patients by optimized balloon angioplasty , UNK and stenting as well as by the combined approach of primary tissue removal with adjunctive stent implantation .    2.436832606228369
this article summarizes the mechanical techniques of restenosis prevention or reduction that have been documented in controlled trials .    2.22671054591522
additional pharmacologic interventions and possibly genetic and / or radiotherapeutic approaches will be highly important for future reduction of restenosis .    2.3319986221636615
161 UNK of the frontal skull base carried out from 1979 to 1994 at the ent - department fulda were evaluated in a retrospective study in regard to etiology , operative techniques and results .    2.6982253413962702
duraplasty of the UNK was indicated in 70 cases of UNK trauma , 47 cases after paranasal sinus surgery , 36 cases of tumors and 8 malformations .    2.616479206490877
after an average follow - up time of 6 years the patients were interviewed for postoperative liquorrhea , UNK treated with antibiotics and meningitis .    2.8833292916679856
as an objective measure to verify the tight closure of the treated csf - leaks a UNK test was performed in 50 , 9 % 6 to 8 weeks after the operation .    2.7495108694260257
duraplasty was successfull in more than 96 % .    2.720987904501739
the approach and technique to perform a duraplasty have to be UNK individually considering size , location and etiology of the dural defect .    2.4749385180460397
in the majority of dural defects in the area of the frontal skull base reconstruction can be carried out now a days via an endonasal approach .    2.5523244830432286
by use of allogenic tissue , a mucosal flap from the surrounding area to cover the graft and fibrin clue good results were obtained .    2.258055485171788
the UNK is a characteristic and pathognomonic sign of chronic gout .    3.1596066522082245
before effective drugs were available for the treatment of hyperuricaemia about 50 - 60 % of patients with gout developed clinically and radiologically apparent urate crystal deposits .    2.831983827333775
clinical cutaneous manifestations of chronic gout are now rarely observed .    2.453560829222298
however , the presence of degenerative tissues , as in idiopathic osteoarthritis of the fingers , may predispose to the deposition of urate crystals .    2.3383858881055763
we report on a patient with secondary - probably diuretic - induced - hyperuricaemia and gout UNK in UNK ' s nodes .    2.376264546266969
hiv - 1 - associated encephalopathy ( hive ) remains an important manifestation of advanced hiv infection despite recent progress in antiretroviral therapy .    2.2356074355258313
this is in part due to particular pharmacological and virological characteristics of the central nervous system ( cns ) .    2.3072882619688926
hive is characterized by a " subcortical " dementia with psychomotor slowing as well as memory and concentration deficits .    2.820892700410127
pathogenetically , an enhanced viral replication in immunocompetent cns cells is believed to be a requirement .    2.409494568987101
this leads to neurotoxic effects directly elicited by viral products as well as indirectly by the immune response to virus infection .    2.323054375434169
hiv - 1 myelopathy ( hivm ) is the other cns manifestion of late hiv infection .    2.30543565695598
the present consensus paper recommends diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in hive and hivm and outlines the current research .    2.128494944424397
background : prognostic data heart failure rely on epidemiological studies or large clinical trials .    2.070546540357961
these data are not to transfer easily on everyday practice .    2.369147184802863
forty - nine patients ( mean age , 54 years ) admitted for displaced ankle fractures were observed retrospectively to determine by clinical examination and measurement of plantar pressure distribution whether successful surgical treatment of ankle fractures had led to gait symmetry .    2.3479557452511144
the mean follow - up was 36 months ( range , 19 - 54 months ) .    2.5555295571229757
the deviation in gait was quantified using peak pressure .    2.213675457676885
using a clinical score , most of the patients had satisfactory results .    3.3042676623097678
the plantar pressure distribution showed significant load UNK of patients with satisfactory results and those with non - satisfactory results .    2.786808670795825
dynamic gait analysis allows quantification of gait UNK and clinically non - visible gait disorder .    2.0893628506022432
comparison of radiation exposure applied by different types of ct scanners for the investigation of the chest and abdomen .    2.755077896695583
determination of radiation exposure applied by multi - phase spiral ct . estimation of the dose in air in the system axis of the scanner , the ct dose index ( ctdi ) and the effective dose for electron beam tomography ( ebt ) and two conventional ct scanners ( sequence , seq ; spiral , sct ) .    2.1439228076914745
for ebt , dose in system axis for investigation of the abdomen was above 50 UNK .    2.2207028501916497
investigation of the abdomen with the ebt should only be performed for certain indications .    2.78845110919201
with spiral ct , effective dose is much lower than with ebt .    2.460997384591088
bone fracture , soft - tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock are frequent complications in trauma patients , and these patients are known to be immunocompromised .    2.917582731445401
nonetheless , it is difficult to differentiate the effect of soft - tissue trauma plus hemorrhage from that of bone fracture and hemorrhage on host immune function in the clinical setting .    2.9781013671348173
to determine this experimentally , closed bone fracture ( right lower leg ) and / or soft - tissue trauma ( 2 . 5 cm midline laparotomy ) were induced prior to hemorrhagic shock ( mean arterial bp of 35 + / - 5 mm hg for 90 min ) in male UNK / hen mice .    2.3481642568944703
all animals were killed at 72 h after initiation of the experiment and the spleens were collected UNK .    2.1789763989113196
more significant depression of UNK il - 2 and il - 3 release occurred with the combined insult than after bony injury or tissue trauma alone with hemorrhage .    2.2398046276795673
the present study suggests that different traumatic insults , i . e . bone fracture as well as soft - tissue trauma in conjunction with hemorrhagic shock , produce comparable depression of host immune function .    2.416238345037143
moreover , combination of closed bone fracture and soft - tissue trauma prior to hemorrhagic shock leads to even more compromised immunity .    2.2324572959626323
this indicates that different mechanisms of immune depression may be involved following soft - tissue trauma or bony injury coupled with hemorrhage .    2.1454246944234914
the markedly depressed immune function following bony injury , soft - tissue trauma and hemorrhagic shock may contribute to the increased susceptibility of severely injured patients to sepsis and the ensuing multiple organ failure in the clinical situation .    2.4105651020047314
in the management of acute major vessel occlusion , the use of fibrinolytic agents such as recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) , urokinase or streptokinase is widely accepted .    2.385195716847498
today , the spectrum of indications for thrombolytic drugs comprises acute myocardial infarction , lung embolism , ischaemic stroke , deep vein thrombosis and acute arterial occlusions of the lower limbs .    2.4642751552213142
in view of the histopathological and clinical features of retinal vessel occlusion , fibrinolysis aimed at early restoration of blood flow appears to be a promising therapeutic approach .    2.55515721972705
basically , it is of some concern that the systemic administration of fibrinolytic agents is associated with a haemorrhagic risk .    2.911113297380787
since this includes cerebral haemorrhage or gastrointestinal bleeding , the choice of an appropriate intravenous thrombolytic therapy in a non - life threatening situation such as central retinal artery occlusion ( crao ) or central retinal vein occlusion ( UNK ) should be based on UNK the risk of adverse events .    2.754042334329079
furthermore , the fibrinolytic treatment of choice should be able to produce rapid and complete restoration of retinal capillary and arterial or venous blood flow and maintain patency long enough for retinal salvage to take place .    2.094605138907738
in this article , we review several studies of fibrinolytic therapy in patients with retinal vessel occlusion to determine whether this treatment is likely to improve major clinical outcomes .    2.604695731908549
moreover , we review the large scale trials of fibrinolysis in myocardial infarction and acute ischaemic stroke to evaluate safety and efficacy of various thrombolytic regimens .    2.2179766374515526
furthermore , we report on our results of fibrinolytic therapy with low dose rt - pa in patients with retinal artery occlusion and ischaemic central retinal vein occlusion .    2.8587226745768226
in light of the fact that the occurrence of bleeding complications constitutes a dose dependent problem , we conclude that the use of low dose regimens should be the ideal approach to fibrinolysis in retinal vessel occlusion .    2.636026835384546
although the results of our pilot studies must be interpreted with caution , we believe that the administration of low - dose rt - pa ( 50 mg ) in a UNK manner ( = simultaneous administration of rt - pa and intravenous heparin ) constitutes a reasonable treatment option in patients with central retinal artery occlusion ( crao ) or ischaemic retinal vein occlusion ( rvo ) , recent onset of symptoms ( crao < = 12 h , rvo < = 11 d ) and severe visual loss ( < = 20 / 50 ) .    2.3555560417989594
because of these limitations and the numerous contraindications of fibrinolytic therapy , only a limited number of patients will be suitable for this treatment .    2.6285896934705733
in view of the poor visual and ocular prognosis in severe retinal vessel occlusion , controlled clinical trials are needed to determine the benefit of thrombolysis in the management of this disease .    2.6887422565613788
this study was designed to determine the relationship between the electroencephalogram ( eeg ) and clinical signs of depth of anaesthesia during induction of anaesthesia by slow infusion of propofol ( 18 mg / kg - h ) .    2.5940087452650453
the object of this study was to evaluate currently published data regarding extragenital neoplasia induced by hrt .    2.3150619597857287
objective : this study was designed to investigate the differences between tiva with propofol / remifentanil ( p / r ) and balanced anaesthesia with sevoflurane / fentanyl ( s / f ) in gynaecological laparoscopic surgery .    2.199691251198401
emphasis was put on haemodynamic reaction , recovery profile , postoperative side effects and patient satisfaction .    2.385578388970543
confluent and UNK papillomatosis ( crp ) is a rare dermatosis of unknown aetiology .    2.704534093458486
recent electron microscopic studies suggest that crp is a disorder of UNK .    2.5135379356137277
in our case we could not confirm the previously reported ultrastructural findings .    2.452286992731928
crp is generally resistant to therapy .    2.631054061454761
we treated a 19 - year - old patient with typical crp with oral minocycline .    2.4259361597996065
within a few weeks the eruption resolved completely .    2.5020626189923094
a mild relapse 7 months later responded promptly to a repeated course of minocycline .    2.0559746367650744
twelve months after UNK of therapy there is no evidence of recurrence .    3.0700342922091615
in crp minocycline should be preferred to systemic retinoid therapy because of its minor side effects .    2.3694285355672755
wound instillation seems to be an easy and preferable way to achieve postoperative analgesia in pediatric hernioplasty .    2.5460722651107788
this prospective , randomized and double - blinded pilot - study was initiated to gain preliminary information in order to define the appropriate concentration of local anaesthetic for efficient UNK analgesia .    2.4006210487674418
the recommended infusion time for i . v .    2.3830386597806794
prostaglandin e 1 ( pge1 ) therapy is 2 or 3 h , depending on the dose .    2.53926687995216
the aim of the present multicentre study was to investigate , for the first time , whether the dose of 60 µg pge1 is effective and well tolerated with shorter infusion times .    2.5901959957669667
a total of 118 patients with intermittent claudication and a pain - free walking distance between 50 and 200 m ( 3 km / h , 12 % ) were randomized to receive an i . v .    2.2486945236063574
infusion of 3 ampoules UNK ( 60 µg pge1 ) administered for either 1 or 2 h , once a day for 4 weeks .    2.226569138630614
primary variables were pain - free walking distance as well as safety , determined by the frequency of adverse events and the course of blood pressure .    3.4675638786304415
the efficacy was comparable in the two groups .    2.5251269429996275
in the 1 - h infusion group , the pain - free walking distance increased from 87 to 135 m , and in the 2 - h group from 88 to 147 m , while the absolute walking distance increased from 124 to 200 m and from 147 to UNK m , respectively .    2.200152131057057
the differences between the two groups were not significant , although an analysis of subgroups with initial pain - free walking distances of less than 80 m indicated a significant difference in favour of the 2 - h pge1 infusion ( increase in walking distance 58 m as compared with 22 m ) .    2.29659640760841
course of blood pressure and frequency of adverse events were comparable in the two groups .    2.7400223701085245
altogether , in intermittent claudication both the 1 - h and the 2 - h pge1 infusion show comparably good results in terms of efficacy and safety .    2.5003796733891277
patients with an initial pain - free walking distance of less than 80 m seem to reveal a major benefit after a 2 - h pge1 infusion .    2.415165262472197
the problem in the treatment of deep hyalin cartilage defects is due to the minimal regeneration potential of this specific tissue .    2.9315212272318725
several attempts were made to solve this difficulties experimentally and clinically .    2.3275461144045533
the proliferative potential of autogenous perichondrium / periost is well - known for decades .    2.3598800164842744
gender identity change in UNK patients is rare .    2.9295099781334866
we report on the transsexual development of a patient with male UNK .    2.9126742273928015
the case report emphasizes the importance of a thorough differential diagnosis .    2.7047443685048327
fractionated irradiation with x - rays or UNK is an important therapeutic option in the palliative treatment of kaposi ' s sarcoma .    2.7441349971448314
we report on three hiv patients demonstrating bullous cutaneous eruptions in the irradiation field .    2.0345487912625204
three UNK men ( age 45 - 60 y ) stage of disease cdc UNK , were treated with fractionated soft x - rays with the scheme conventionally used by us ( total dose 30 gy , single doses 3 gy ) .    2.2211952034310363
immediately to three days after completion of treatment large blisters appeared within the irradiation field , resolving after 2 - 4 weeks , leaving postinflammatory hyperpigmentation .    2.173048578259226
controlled prospective studies applying different fractionation schemes will be necessary to better elucidate this issue .    2.2328420036545564
due to the decreased trauma in anterior as well as posterior surgical approaches to the spine , microsurgical techniques have been used more frequently in recent years .    3.039618996272662
this article describes two new microsurgical techniques to approach the anterior lumbar spine for interbody fusion as part of a posterior - anterior stabilization concept in various diseases like spondylolisthesis , degenerative instability ; failed back surgery syndrome , fractures etc .    1.839485245418695
the lumbar segments l 2 - 5 are approached through a blunt muscle - splitting retroperitoneal technique .    2.1387674107226142
the antero - lateral circumference of the motion segment is exposed with a frame - type retractor which is anchored in the adjacent vertebral bodies with anchoring screws .    1.9310718164715772
the lumbosacral junction is exposed via a mini - laparotomy using a special soft tissue UNK .    2.0950901198915006
preliminary experience with 83 patients treated between 1995 and 1996 show that peri - and postoperative morbidity is low .    2.4835633705819276
clinical as well as radiological results are comparable to the standard techniques .    3.22397274380616
spectrum as well as rate of complications so far do not differ from those described in the literature for non - microsurgical approaches .    3.0308538437195462
the posterior cruciate ligament ( pcl ) is the strongest ligament of the human knee joint .    3.042396792888107
its origin is at the lateral wall of the medial femoral condyle and the insertion is located in the posterior part of the intercondylar area .    3.268594082901087
the posterior cruciate ligament consists of multiple small fiber bundles .    2.4908789962122633
from a functional point of view , one can differentiate fiber bundles with an anterior origin and fiber bundles with a posterior origin at the femur .    2.157468440902736
the anterior fibers insert in the anterolateral part of the tibial insertion zone .    2.6737865897751836
these fibers become tense when the knee is flexed .    2.130398543948329
the posterior fibers insert in the posteromedial part of the tibial insertion and become tense when the knee is extended .    2.30519476500908
the main part of the posterior cruciate ligament consists of type i collagen positive dense connective tissue .    2.8413103269637006
the longitudinal fibrils of type i collagen are divided into small bundles by thin type iii collagen positive fibrils .    2.087201946691558
in the center of the middle third region , the structure of the tissue varies from the typical structure of a ligament .    2.519976875850983
in this region , the structure of the tissue UNK fibrocartilage .    2.7594491721843446
oval - shaped cells surrounded by a metachromatic extracellular matrix lie between the longitudinal collagen fibrils .    2.111299755635083
the femoral origin and the tibial insertion have the structure of chondral UNK UNK .    2.4885366379813316
the blood supply of the pcl arises from the middle geniculate artery .    2.603400365041295
the ligament is covered by a synovial fold where the terminal branches of the middle and the inferior geniculate artery form a UNK network .    2.2279477709124302
from the synovial sheath , the blood vessels penetrate the ligament in a transverse direction and anastomose with a longitudinally orientated intraligamentous network .    1.963260917631761
the distribution of blood vessels within the pcl is not homogeneous .    2.565466979931231
we detected three avascular areas within the ligament : both fibrocartilaginous UNK of the pcl are devoid of blood vessels .    2.427752875539453
atrial reentrant tachycardias ( art ) are a potentially life - threatening complication in survivors of congenital heart disease surgery .    2.4300652151157736
from july 1993 to december 1997 , temporary transesophageal pacing was used to UNK 29 tachycardia episodes in 19 patients .    2.326476923235083
at the time of the first tachycardia episode , patients ' ages were 1 month to 26 years ( mean 9 . 8 yrs ) .    2.4444073254431173
time from operation to onset of first tachycardia episode ranged from 1 day to 19 years .    2.2931035482512407
onset was within the first 2 weeks postoperatively in 6 patients and occurred later in 13 patients ( 1 to 19 years after operation ) .    2.7371434044763783
postoperative pacemaker implantation had been performed in 2 pts ; 17 of 19 pts were receiving antiarrhythmic medication .    2.241029685759328
after UNK a UNK transesophageal catheter , atrial and ventricular signals were recorded and atrial stimulation performed .    2.1786437735598927
atrial cycle length of tachycardia ranged from 160 - 380 ms with 1 : 1 to 4 : 1 av conduction .    2.171997762182497
temporary transesophageal pacing was performed following an algorithm starting with 4 UNK ( 20 ms below atrial cycle length of tachycardia ) .    1.9711888864036784
tachycardia terminated in 27 of 29 cases ( 93 % ) without complications .    2.367872085878631
in 3 cases , conversion was achieved by pacing after amiodarone 5 mg / kg i . v .    2.3944176758953746
after tachycardia conversion , sinus - or pacemaker rhythm was present in 20 cases .    2.285927530197354
in 9 cases atrial fibrillation was recorded ; spontaneous conversion to sinus rhythm occurred after a maximum of 3 min ( 7 cases ) or persisted and required direct current cardioversion ( 2 cases ) .    2.1675519283550035
in conclusion , transesophageal atrial pacing is an effective , relatively noninvasive method for conversion of atrial reentrant tachycardias after operation for congenital heart disease .    2.076753142386005
after UNK the components and theory of neuroticism ( n ) as well as of psychosomatic complaints and their relationships to personality dimensions and to psychosomatic diseases , comparisons are performed between patients suffering from fibromyalgia syndrome ( fms ) or related pain diseases with healthy subjects scoring high on personality dimensions related to neuroticism .    2.034474529023155
fms and pain patients score high on depression , anxiety , and experience of stress although questionnaire scores on depression are higher in subjects not exhibiting somatic features of the disease .    2.0826038446125534
high subjective pain sensitivity and low thresholds for pain perception are also common features in high n subjects and fms patients .    1.9564640356371468
a common feature , however , is the lack of UNK in the two groups , since UNK are in particular characterized by a low capacity to shift their behavior from one state to the other ( UNK - sleeping , working - UNK ) , to re - adapt to baseline levels after endocrinological or physiological stress responses , or to adjust to conditions of shift work .    2.6693348258884955
this is reflected by UNK disturbances in fms patients and could also explain their UNK of pain perception , because they are incapable of correcting conditioned pain - producing muscle tension .    1.9977255794581665
purpose : to document our experience with spiral UNK - ct of the pancreas based on a combination of pharmacologic intestinal paralysis and water distension of the stomach and duodenum with specific reference to tumor detection rate , differentiation of malignant versus benign tumors and assessment of tumor resectability in a prospective study on UNK consecutive patients .    2.3850755689040146
since the publication of a case of syphilis transmission by blood transfusion in UNK the discussion about transfusion - associated bacterial infection is ongoing .    2.5973244743141564
for some time , virus infections through blood and blood products have been highlighted .    2.2738886424958458
however , in the last years the attention required has been drawn to the problem of transmission of bacteria .    2.6904008958406616
in this publication the present situation concerning the contamination rates through blood components and the frequency of transfusion - associated microbial infections is outlined .    2.085748446817622
the bacteria involved are discussed .    2.601901170468755
furthermore , the state of the art for prevention and diagnosis as well as the methods for inactivation of bacteria are assessed .    2.5460480320918117
while working to develop a distal locking device , we analyzed distal nail position with reference to nail deformation and a radiographic - morphometric investigation .    2.1656157603468142
the amount and the direction of implant deformation in UNK UNK UNK unreamed tibial nails ( synthes ) were analyzed .    2.564156236340346
measurement of implant deformation ( 3 translations , 3 angles ) in the center of the distal transverse locking hole was performed with a 3d magnetic motion UNK system before and after nail insertion .    2.4745550816957724
the results showed lateral translations of - 4 . 5 + / - 3 . 5 mm ( mean and standard deviation , range 14 . 3 mm ) and dorsal translations of - 7 . 8 + / - 5 . 8 mm ( mean and standard deviation , range 19 . 2 mm ) .    2.6470554982314445
rotational deformations around the longitudinal axis of the nail were 0 . 3 + / - 0 . 7 ° ( mean and standard deviation , range 2 . 4 ° ) .    2.7560829807410383
the results showed , that a simple aiming arm , mounted on the proximal nail end , alone or even in combination with a large working channel ( e . g .    2.161843390394628
10 mm in diameter ) , was not adequate to the aiming process .    2.7017469876240847
a radiographic - morphometric analysis was subsequently performed in 40 tibiae after experimental ( n = 20 ) or clinical ( n = 20 ) implantation of nails 8 mm and 9 mm in diameter .    2.289060261978383
these data were the basis for the development of an aiming technique that UNK the relatively constant distance between the distal nail hole and the anterior aspect of the tibia .    2.782838004898738
the goal of the interdisciplinary longitudinal study of aging ( ilse ) is to assess healthy and satisfying aging in middle adulthood and later life .    1.944310439285469
the data for this study were collected between late 1993 and early 1996 as part of the first measurement point of the ilse .    2.7138700702586096
five - hundred and one participants from the leipzig region were compared with 500 participants from the heidelberg area on four specific dimensions : personality , cognitive functioning , subjective well - being , and health .    2.042699723544981
age differences were obtained for neuroticism , UNK , openness , and UNK .    3.080461647880883
differences were also obtained in cognitive functioning and health .    2.4770492178595775
regional differences between eastern and western germany were obtained in the personality dimensions neuroticism , openness and UNK , as well as in subjective well - being .    2.542537098829628
the results are discussed with respect to functional abilities and levels of satisfaction in midlife , as well as with respect to regional differences that might be due to prior political system differences in the east and west .    2.636185695861288
modern obstetrics must try to maintain high safety standards for both mother and child and , at the same time , UNK the general desire of women for natural birth .    2.319288623903846
standards of safety are based on early recognition of high risks , allowing early intervention to prevent serious complications .    2.3962609842126046
a considerable number of diagnostic and therapeutic measures recommended on a prophylactic basis and therefore widely used are responsible for the medical - technical image associated with modern obstetrics .    2.40744683149728
the benefits of most of these prophylactically recommended activities are unproven or low relative to the unavoidable side effects and the costs associated with widespread application .    2.2690976111494368
in a population of healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancies , the prevalence of perinatal mortality or morbidity is so low that even with meta - analysis of several studies the numbers remain too small to show significant differences for these rare events .    2.1167584122157717
in high - risk cases the routine application of fetal heart rate monitoring throughout labor and delivery is undisputed and leads to a significant drop in UNK and mortality of the baby .    2.738558341579095
with careful selection of pregnant women a combination of electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and UNK during certain segments of the first stage of labor provides adequate surveillance .    2.366790362661763
we report the history of a 38 year old patient who began to develop mental deterioration at the age of 26 .    2.8679359955641206
after a time of 7 years neurological signs like writing dystonia occured .    2.4210458220171196
UNK - UNK - desease ( hsd ) was diagnosed at the age of 36 in vivo with the clinical presentation of severe dystonia , rigidity , dementia , and typical signal loss in the globus - pallidus the reticular part of the substantia nigra , and the nucleus ruber in the t - 2 weighted mri .    2.4320720765751327
the " eye - of - the - UNK " - sign , a bilateral UNK in the rostral globus pallidus , was not observed in follow - up examinations .    2.870609005534123
hsd is a rare autosomal - recessive or sporadic disease of unknown etiology .    2.664432365032778
in one third of the patients a dementing process is the first clinical sign of the disorder , and is a rare differential diagnosis of early onset dementia .    3.658219170435837
in 33 patients with chronic venous incompetence ( cvi ) caused by primary UNK or postthrombotic syndrome stage i - iii ( according to widmer ) the therapeutic benefit of 6 months of medically supervised physical exercise training was documented .    2.353325011749353
mobility in the upper ankle joint was improved UNK as venous drainage function .    2.5865723547776365
clinical benefit was achieved in the reduction of ulcer size ; 7 of 10 ulcers completely healed .    2.5214988164750736
medically supervised physical exercise training and optimized compression therapy are basic therapeutic approaches in conservative treatment in chronic venous insufficiency .    2.2500079397697417
costs are covered by the patient ' s health insurance company in germany , as long as the exercise training is medically supervised .    2.7485726243743294
epileptic seizures may alter autonomic functions .    2.4953270403957744
this is especially the case with complex focal seizures ( of temporal lobe origin ) and UNK mal .    2.4517147433472166
most frequently , such seizures cause ictal tachycardia , sometimes tachypnea , probably caused by the propagation of epileptic discharges to autonomic cerebral structures .    2.04878274376588
ictal bradycardia and asystole are rare phenomena .    2.4172635235078426
however , they may be life threatening .    2.957450081047854
their differentiation from primary cardiac arrest is possible by the use of ictal eeg and ecg registration .    2.571682881754162
postictal serum prolactin measurement does not differentiate syncope from seizure .    2.1571095528593687
however , a postictal increase of creatine kinase is only measured after epileptic seizures and not after syncope .    1.9641818853900637
there is growing evidence that ictal asystole is a cofactor in sudden unexplained death in epileptic patients .    1.9129476647531423
a minimal documentation system ( UNK ) has been developed for self - assessment of pain and other symptoms by the patients on palliative care units .    3.106458017635911
to decrease the administrative burden and thereby increase the acceptance of the system an electronic database was developed to facilitate data entry and documentation .    2.2209493200497006
background : hearing loss can be found in more than 50 % of children with down syndrome .    2.7844960674628645
chronic or recurrent middle - ear effusions are considered the most frequent etiology with an incidence of 60 % .    2.696874157872265
microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a rare UNK cutaneous neoplasm characterised by slow but locally aggressive growth .    2.470100379446927
its histogenesis and nomenclature are still a subject of controversy .    2.5333993938969925
under - recognition and the tumour ' s bland cytologic features lead to frequent misdiagnoses .    2.0068917608929557
in addition , subclinical tumour invasion explains the high incidence of local recurrence .    2.404336768575068
thus , the tumour makes great demands on the planning of its surgical removal .    2.3570072177555765
on the basis of this case , differential diagnoses , histogenesis and micrographic surgery as the treatment of choice are discussed .    2.6939913973777987
in old age , UNK processes also simultaneously effect the opportunity and necessity to shape one ' s life .    2.2708571507044386
societal orientation UNK , and the UNK of earlier times disappear .    3.8958461986472357
UNK and option appear as an increasing UNK challenge to coping with life .    2.237937051585912
these ambiguities characterize modern old age .    2.4213874591241478
or in other words : the UNK of old age has begun .    3.2860513369712923
posttraumatic cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) is associated with a poor outcome .    2.866703132953043
when evaluating the literature according to the utstein method , there were only 2 survivors ( 0 . 18 % ) out of 1 , 135 cpr attempts after trauma ( table 1 ) .    2.553455823107916
differences in the study populations and levels of prehospital trauma care led us to analyse the results of a physician - staffed prehospital trauma care system in cologne .    2.7473448547365034
from january 1987 to december 1990 , a total of 49 , UNK emergency calls were registered using a standardised protocol .    2.477673873328218
among 9 , UNK trauma - related calls , UNK patients were found to be pulseless on arrival of the emergency team , UNK of these were pronounced dead .    2.725879275968296
cpr was initiated in the remaining 224 patients , who comprise the study population ( defined as 100 % ) .    2.612609854684926
all patients who were admitted to a hospital were followed using a second protocol .    2.713347796255662
cpr in the field was successful in 68 ( 30 . 4 % ) patients , who were then admitted to a hospital ; 42 of these died within the first 24 h . four patients ( 1 . 8 % ) could be discharged from hospital alive and were still living 1 year later , 1 with a lasting neurological deficit ( fig .    2.7962876906750065
in 156 ( 69 . 6 % ) cases resuscitative attempts were unsuccessful in the field .    2.6999254346220107
even in a physician - staffed prehospital trauma care system , the chance of surviving a post - traumatic cardiac arrest is minimal .    2.322115325742361
survival has to be regarded as an individual fate ; the overall results are UNK .    2.9210944871132574
even though this study analyses the largest population of posttraumatic cpr ever published , prognostic factors could not be identified due to the few survivors .    2.473558971516112
nevertheless , the result does not justify general omission of cpr after trauma as : ( 1 ) prognostic factors for survival have not been identified thus far ; and ( 2 ) no significant additional costs arise from posttraumatic cpr .    2.2592186377153087
functional voiding disturbances can be due to failure of the UNK or to UNK sphincter function during micturition .    3.400921676201883
therapeutical options are directed either to strengthening the contraction up to an adequate magnitude or to lowering the voiding resistance or can be aimed at influencing both .    1.9758308591777753
in a brief survey mechanical , UNK , UNK , and surgical measures as well as drug treatment are critically examined .    3.3191633480610063
conservative methods should always be attempted before surgical procedures are performed .    2.6663748049747316
depending on the degree of severity and the etiology of the disease , a combined therapy can be useful .    3.655086422665034
in the case of resistance to therapy , intermittent UNK is to be preferred to permanent deviation via an indwelling catheter .    2.4527734068332894
during long - term therapy of hyperuricaemia with allopurinol ( 300 mg / d ) two patients developed generalized granuloma annulare .    2.5110326663919302
the diagnoses were confirmed by histology ; concomitant diseases , especially diabetes mellitus , were not detectable .    2.3336025410722216
following discontinuation of allopurinol therapy , cutaneous granulomas healed without relapse .    2.1767059768567427
hyperuricaemia could be controlled by low - purine diet and medication avoiding allopurinol .    2.269725993536265
the clinical history of our two patients suggested a causal connection between allopurinol therapy and generalized granuloma annulare .    2.142766685928357
for this reason we rate the development of this disease in both cases as a rare but significant side effect of allopurinol .    3.1116945161666076
this should give rise to critical assessment of concomitant drug therapy during development of generalized granuloma annulare .    2.0816457243785886
background : aim of the present prospective longitudinal study was the statistical foundation and thus further replication of recent findings of UNK [ 13 ] , who postulated a significant importance of specific , within the psychological pain research long neglected pain coping strategies as risk factors concerning pain chronification : UNK to " UNK it out " on the cognitive level and endurance strategies on the behavioural level .    1.9330341778236673
intraarticular bleeding and muscle bleeding occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma in hemophilia a or b .    2.398362347368249
the most common sites for hemarthrosis are the knees joints , elbows and UNK joints .    2.2332000896067257
resorption of intraarticular blood induces reactive hemophilic synovitis .    2.314186614407406
hyperplasia of the synovium can be followed by recurrent bleedings .    2.7779708725612866
these early reactions can change to a chronic synovitis and cause cartilage damage , finally resulting in a complete destruction of the joint .    2.451869153011447
since 1981 158 adults and 61 children with a hemophilia a or b were treated at the center for hemophilic disorders frankfurt in an interdisciplinary approach .    2.1166543776289486
consequent prophylactic treatment with factor substitution can prevent the incidence of severe hemarthrosis .    2.6721063969135685
minor joint bleedings are treated by adequate factor substitution , temporarily non - weight bearing of the extremity , application of ice - UNK and physical therapy .    2.4120330876121825
more severe joint hemorrhages should be aspirated in order to reduce the acute synovitis .    2.8921599060696384
this is followed by a consequent physical therapy ( joint and soft tissue techniques ) and anti - inflammatory drugs .    2.3893956806224548
the goal is a sufficient muscular balance of the joint , the improvement of the coordination , and the proprioception .    3.262181076280223
the chronic synovitis is less painful and poorly responses to conservative interventions .    2.199689831686205
local ice application , UNK and local anti - inflammatory treatment support the physical therapy .    2.7626303695705583
soft heel shock UNK , elastic and semi - rigid bandages prevent recurrent bleeding episodes by shock absorption and decrease of synovial impingement .    1.8609079502682953
synovectomy is indicated in cases of chronic persistent synovitis .    3.306434168766661
UNK ( UNK ) , which is an alternative in certain cases , has been performed with great success in 12 cases in our hospital .    3.3570311219132876
in advanced arthropathy joint mobilization should be the emphasis of the physical therapy .    2.5825036682370466
bandages , crutches and UNK shoe devices improve the walking capacity .    2.119285512669598
over an 18 - month period findings of stress x - ray of the ankle and medical records of 112 cases were analyzed retrospectively as to indications , results and therapeutic consequences .    2.3011299865960377
the analysis showed that critical setting of indications can reduce the frequency of stress x - ray of the ankle and thus lower the total costs .    2.69327386003118
the introduction of guidelines could be advantageous at medical training institutions .    2.2168705155964568
a 72 - year - old patient received 0 . 1 mg morphine by the intrathecal route and UNK . 5 mg midazolam as adjuvant therapy .    2.8745305688811023
continuous administration of > 6 mg UNK to UNK the supposed effect of the morphine had no effect .    2.854212497507034
the patient ' s condition was not normalized until a single dose of 0 . 3 mg UNK was administered .    2.7853625943318354
for the time being , especially in the case of elderly patients , we recommend that strict indications are adhered to when intrathecal administration of morphine is considered and that less than 0 . 1 mg morphine is given .    2.734750431151195
respiration should be monitored for quite some time .    2.5889678687867526
in contrast to the often debated nyha classification , the determination of peak oxygen uptake ( peak vo2 ) by cardiopulmonary exercise testing allows an objective assessment of the exercise capacity of patients with congestive heart failure ( chf ) .    2.398438086179966
however , cardiopulmonary exercise testing is a time consuming and costly diagnostic tool , which requires sophisticated equipment and specially trained personell .    2.147139213731697
exercise capacity can also be determined by the 6 minute walk test .    3.0504455256558285
this test simply measures the distance covered by strong walking on a UNK level within 6 minutes .    2.208254765940173
the 6 minute walk test is a submaximal exercise test , which is associated with much smaller UNK in heart rate , blood pressure and plasma catecholamines than cardiopulmonary exercise testing .    2.606486505406763
it is characterized by a very small intraindividual variance .    2.63170428180189
furthermore , it can be easily performed and , due to low logistic and personal requirements , it is very cost effective .    2.8934885284184046
the results of the 6 minute walk test - as well as of cardiopulmonary exercise testing - are influenced by UNK exercise - limiting disorders , such as pulmonary diseases .    2.569863254344481
independent from the etiology of chf , the results of the 6 minute walk test are closely related to peak vo2 .    2.782711310700266
in serial exercise testing the distance covered within 6 minutes allow to predict the individual peak vo2 .    2.245565559003338
like peak vo2 the 6 minute walk test has been shown to be a predictor of morbidity and mortality in chf , with its predictive value being independent from left ventricular ejection fraction and other potential prognostic parameters .    2.324556874362358
in chf patients a walking distance < 300 m is associated with a one - year - mortality of up to 50 % , whereas the one - year - mortality in patients reaching a walking distance > 450 m amounts to only a few percent .    3.089024858787459
in addition , the hospitalization rate of patients reaching a walking distance of < 300 m is several fold higher than in those with a walking distance > = 450 m . like cardiopulmonary exercise testing , the 6 minute walk test allows to control the efficiency of specific treatments and to monitor the natural course of the disease .    2.116607191116302
the 6 minute walk test is , thus , a cost effective alternative to cardiopulmonary exercise testing in chf patients .    2.5290775692791025
however , neither the 6 minute walk test alone nor the results of cardiopulmonary exercise testing alone are sufficient for selecting patients , e . g . , for cardiac transplantation , as each individual case requires a synopsis of all relevant facts and parameters .    2.2490968691038833
for over a year , a 16 - year old white girl developed an UNK pruritic symmetrical reticular , papulo - UNK eruption on the trunk , UNK and pubic region .    2.3765847816100916
histologically a superficial perivascular UNK and lichenoid inflammatory pattern with prominent pigmentary incontinence in older lesions was observed .    2.0487886868282863
topical corticosteroids and systemic antihistamines had no effect .    2.423924423110218
systemic corticosteroids and UNK ( dadps ) produced improvement but could not prevent recurrences .    2.466303344151053
healing occurred only after 4 weeks of systemic - minocycline .    2.5787980398647243
following parenteral administration , clonidine has analgesic effects at both cerebral and spinal levels .    2.0581074806129043
patient - controlled analgesia ( pca ) makes it possible to determine equipotent dosages of analgesics by relating analgesic consumption per time to the levels of analgesia obtained in comparable patient populations .    2.0612675240331315
therefore , we studied the UNK ratios of clonidine and piritramide and the incidence of undesired side effects in the treatment of postoperative pain in patients undergoing maxillo - facial surgery .    2.803867545966737
the effects of glycerol are discussed in detail .    2.7595810504957266
glycerol can lead to a transition of crystalline lipid structures within the horny layer lipids into liquid crystalline states .    2.2840423775469136
especially if applied in oil / water - emulsions it improves , the hydration of the horny layers better than urea .    1.9409836235016864
in addition , if facilitates the UNK of desmosomes within the superior layers of the horny layer enhancing desquamation .    2.3990917810572245
furthermore , by using glycerol , the mechanical properties of the skin can be influenced ; long term used leads to increased elasticity .    2.4378039845168566
the roughness of the horny layer is reduced , which can be explained by the UNK and / or the UNK effect .    3.785110675279664
glycerol used in o / w - emulsions also UNK against the influence of UNK or noxious lipophilic agents .    2.5153629546502088
finally , glycerol can lead - similarly to urea - to an improvement in active agent penetration , as has been proven for UNK .    2.1965027731609355
background : an 18 - year - old woman presented with UNK symptoms - right sided lid retraction and exophthalmus .    2.4240483378468216
she complained of diplopia on lateral UNK .    2.384127606489566
laboratory investigations confirmed grave ' s disease with UNK and UNK receptor antibodies .    3.421012438016646
atrial tachyarrhythmias significantly reduce quality of life in a surprisingly large number of patients .    2.990095033862828
the safe and effective treatment of atrial tachyarrhythmias is being intensively studied .    2.89083654377198
internal electrical cardioversion of atrial fibrillation has been shown to be an effective non - pharmacological treatment option .    2.956666333735261
cardioversion therapy has been applied in the absence of a clear understanding of the mechanisms governing the process .    2.9988298245712817
recent measurements of atrial transmembrane potentials using sophisticated optical mapping techniques reveal that internal cardioversion shocks cause changes in repolarization time that favor annihilation of wave UNK .    1.7641564480564043
thus , mechanisms of atrial cardioversion appear to be similar to ventricular defibrillation .    2.5181473729578476
further studies are needed to determine whether cardioversion mechanisms differ for chronic atrial fibrillation compared to acute atrial fibrillation .    2.1910007602407147
UNK non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma is the most common tumor of bone and bone marrow , typically diagnosed by symptoms such as monoclonal paraproteinemia , proteinuria , anemia and hypercalcemia .    2.3824698806877582
in its progress , deposits of amyloids in almost all organs can be observed .    2.43170441771236
however , UNK which are diagnosed by macroglossia of primarily unknown etiology are rare .    2.256030503026587
this case report presents a 61 - year - old woman who suffered from a persistent swelling of the tongue with painful ulcerations .    2.723262770528331
a biopsy led to the diagnosis of primary systemic amyloidosis of the light - chain type , which subsequently proved to be a plasmacytoma with UNK light - chains stage ii after UNK and salmon .    2.453961870227793
in the course of the disease the patient developed further deposits of amyloids in the whole gastro - enteric system .    2.409491162346218
macroglossia as a primary manifestation of plasmacytoma is rarely described in medical literature .    2.3734408297762886
however , reports on deposits of amyloid in the tongue in advanced stages of disease are well known .    2.3497418221729647
aim : improved detection of pulmonary - venous pathologies by imaging the pulmonary veins without arterial overlay .    2.0981686153893357
for the histological verification of suspicious non - palpable small breast tumors , the three - dimensional breast biopsy applied as cylindrical extirpation using the abbi system is the optimal solution at present .    2.1399272324212846
because of the possibility of performing mammography during the operation , errors of localization can be corrected and incorrect incisions avoided .    2.379284579324581
taking the three UNK leading symptoms into consideration - suspicious microcalcification , focal shadow and structural irregularity - it can be stated that the digital mammography of the abbi system is more sensitive than the conventional one for detecting microcalcification , but focal shadow and structural irregularity are detected less well by digital technique .    1.8688606614711503
these structures should be preoperatively marked by using sonography .    2.350714507678702
after the complete removal of suspicious microcalcification checked by digital mammography during the operation , residual tumor might be found in a second excision when histologically invasive or intraductal tumor UNK reach the excision margin ( r1 resection ) .    2.1569315305828947
thirteen invasive and 8 intraductal carcinomas were found in 80 cases of cylindrical extirpation using the abbi system .    2.2476194385151316
in 7 procedures carried out to exclude an in - breast recurrence , 3 intraductal carcinomas and 1 invasive carcinoma were observed .    2.181505741195691
in 8 of 12 invasive carcinomas and in 1 of 5 intraductal carcinomas , breast - conserving therapy was indicated .    2.271823803390925
two cases of invasive carcinoma fulfilled the criteria applied ( minimal tumor - free margin > 2 mm , no extensive intraductal component ) to use the abbi cylinder as lumpectomy without a second excision to follow .    2.0994160733467377
in a UNK multicenter study we followed - up 30 fractures of the neck of the femur in children aged 11 years ( 1 . 5 - 15 years ) for 4 . 8 years ( 0 . 5 - 20 . 0 years ) .    3.0984583552857625
it is the aim of this study to analyse factors possibly related to outcome , like age at injury , type of fracture , interval between injury and treatment , method of stabilization and postoperative interval until full weight bearing .    2.1420639124800838
at follow - up subjective parameters ( pain , weather UNK ) , clinical parameters ( range of motion , claudication , leg length discrepancies ) and radiological parameters ( hip series ) were investigated and medical charts and UNK were reviewed using a standardized protocol .    2.5077101742180186
29 of 30 children ( 96 . 7 % ) have sustained displaced fractures .    2.600238609208715
26 femoral neck fractures ( type i : 1 , type ii : 8 , type iii : 17 ) were stabilized by internal fixation using screws and / or pins .    2.6495127434476964
following non - operative treatment one child suffered a coxa vara and another child suffered a avascular femoral head necrosis in combination with coxa vara and leg length shortening of 4 cm .    2.3095665827851133
following operative treatment 9 of 26 children ( 34 . 6 % ) UNK a avascular femoral head necrosis and 3 children ( 11 . 5 % ) suffered a coxa vara .    2.6655895652572634
in 6 of 26 children ( 23 % ) we observed leg length discrepancies > 2 cm .    2.441660535026872
we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow - up result differencies between the groups of children who have sustained type ii or type iii fractures , or between the groups of children aged < 10 years when compared to children aged > 10 years , or between the group of children who were operated on within 6 hours after the accident when compared to the group of children operated > 6 hours after the accident .    2.459044724267966
we observed no significant follow - up result differences between the groups of children who had different intervals between operation and full weight bearing .    2.4553984057213434
operative fracture management remains the treatment of choice in the majority of displaced femoral neck fractures in children .    2.9868045549961235
however , in our limited study we were not able to demonstrate any significant follow - up result differences between the group of children treated by immediate open reduction and internal fixation ( interval injury - operation < 6 hours ) when compared to children who had been operated > 6 hours after the injury .    2.433922449551436
evidence based standards for structure quality in out - patient management of chronic pain states do not exist .    2.447064166584127
therefore we tried to evaluate if german standards for outpatient management of chronic pain states which are based on opinions of experts for pain management influence the outcome quality of independent physicians for treatment of chronic low back pain .    2.451538314708277
objective : the aim of this study was to compare low dose dopamine and dopexamine with respect to of liver - venous oxygen saturation , oxygen delivery and - demand , liver function tests and cardiocirculatory effects in the reperfusion period during a UNK operation with occlusion of the liver UNK .    2.317273530180985
facial trauma is frequent and mainly caused by motor vehicle accidents .    2.3550828808440563
due to this main etiologic factor , trauma to the facial skeleton is often associated with serious injuries , commonly involving the brain , chest or abdomen .    2.1765961272614778
as a consequence , the initial clinical management of these patients includes control of hemorrhage and immediate assessment of life - threatening injuries , including the maintenance of the airways .    2.772838023829913
patients presenting with facial trauma are initially evaluated with a systematic clinical examination because many fractures can be accurately diagnosed by inspection and palpation alone .    2.0597624785425848
in these cases plain film radiographs serve only for confirmation and documentation of the diagnosis .    2.4551937622137983
in many other cases accompanying and extensive soft tissue swelling may clinically obscure fractures .    2.0466890144653536
a complete and accurate evaluation of these patients requires additional radiological imaging methods .    2.6045406714722725
a series of plain films may be generally sufficient but in most of the cases they can be regarded as initial screening methods for more thorough diagnosis with computed tomography ( ct ) .    2.624038787233969
in trauma patients ct is the imaging method of choice because it shows more fracture lines and displaced fragments than any other imaging modality .    2.3119017872141128
ct UNK soft tissue and bony structures and can localize and even characterize foreign bodies .    2.2916329383617926
a complete and accurate characterization of the fracture type and potentially associated complications is mandatory for the appropriate treatment and can only be achieved by careful radiological ( ct ) evaluation .    2.6404332018298593
on the basis of the claims data of the statutory health insurance funds , surgery rates and small - area variations within the catchment area of the aok magdeburg were examined for the year 1997 .    2.2389245514913205
substantial variation can be constantly seen .    2.4742785852190297
the UNK quotient at the 30 most frequent UNK groups ranged from 2 to 5 .    2.2061112704793464
generally , the extent of the variation was larger with elective procedures than with acute .    2.432558703232247
correlation analyses do not show clear associations with hospital bed supply and physician density in primary sectors .    1.9949731698657878
the extent of the small - area variation requires further research to evaluate possible determinants of surgery rates .    2.4636437637312105
criteria for hospital admission and indications for surgery should be made explicit .    2.7890024932283843
between 1984 and 1994 the legally required task force " advisory committee to the german federal health office in matters of approval and review of existing UNK b3 - psychiatry , neurology , anesthesiology " analyzed and evaluated the cns - active compounds that until then had only possessed a fictitious registration .    1.7817662146705278
the evaluation was related to efficacy and safety within the indications claimed by the UNK .    2.5376455451340556
reviews and monographies had to be established for 445 basic compounds .    2.7829913234292927
one hundred positive and 30 negative monographies were published .    2.2681569825609276
" negative " indicates that none of the claimed indications could be accepted by the committee .    2.4065041189052803
it is UNK that the federal health UNK did not notice a considerable part of these negative evaluations until the present date .    2.0779379670911786
the process of the " UNK " was stopped abruptly by the 5th UNK of the german drug law in august 1994 , - a very doubtful political decision with respect to drug safety in this country .    2.75112049945064
background : we attempted to illustrate connections between selected metabolic parameters and the inflammation course in patients after cataract operations .    2.2366521455648103
without a more detailed knowledge of etiology and pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis final conclusions regarding an association between physical trauma and the onset or course of multiple sclerosis cannot be drawn .    2.3036148465449164
only a few prospective studies which are appropriately designed to prove a putative correlation have been published .    2.3525325817802694
a critical review of these studies and some case reports , in the light of the current pathophysiological concepts of multiple sclerosis , does not indicate a causal relationship between physical trauma and onset of multiple sclerosis or exacerbations .    2.6278290310505725
we report on unusual presentation forms of pneumocystis carinii infection of the lung in two patients with aids .    2.705124240752815
a 36 - years - old woman presented a UNK in the lung middle lobe and bullous changes in the apical portion of the right upper lobe on the chest x - ray .    2.8413597537529918
the biopsy of these lesions was not diagnostic and the patient was operated on .    3.1766384786494952
the surgical specimen of the removed lung segment showed a cavitary lesion with a border of granulation tissue with giant cells , focal recent and older hemorrhages , rests of fibrinous UNK and dystrophic calcifications .    1.7724752258482952
in the surrounding tissue there were pneumocystis carinii in the alveolar spaces and also in the alveolar walls , this tissue invasion through the organisms being most probably the cause of the cavitary change .    2.122837070821569
a UNK virus infection was also found .    2.77489351790849
in aortic atresia , coronary perfusion normally occurs through retrograde blood flow in the ascending aorta .    2.392285043320424
we report on two patients with antegrade flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia .    2.1308551537897222
in one patient with hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( aortic atresia , severe mitral stenosis ) , an intact interatrial septum / premature closure of the foramen ovale was found .    2.2162771310812417
while no other way of left atrial or ventricular decompression was found , echocardiography , angiography and the post - mortem examination showed left ventricular to coronary sinusoids as the sole pathway for systemic oxygenation .    2.0147464667457533
in a second patient with complex congenital heart disease , including aortic atresia , antegrade flow in the ascending aorta was through a left coronary fistula with shunt flow originating from the pulmonary UNK .    2.307728454509139
this report describes systemic perfusion depending on retrograde coronary flow due to coronary - UNK ( sinusoids ) and coronary arterio - venous fistulas leading to the phenomenon of antegrade blood flow in the ascending aorta despite aortic atresia .    2.085421129062473
the introduction of biosensor technology for near bedside measurement of plasma lactate concentrations has been a promising step for critical care UNK .    2.135650176433685
however , methodological drawbacks and relevant inaccuracy have been reported .    2.183020382975794
with the advent of a new biosensor ( UNK diagnostics ) and a revised UNK biomedical device , accuracy was expected to be improved .    2.4787232417704184
the goal of the present investigation was to evaluate the accuracy of both methods .    3.1761418152659706
the combined histological and microcomputed analysis of human iliac crest biopsies leads to major advances in our understanding of three - dimensional bone architecture .    2.212215597746997
microcomputed tomography avoids the time - consuming reconstruction and artifacts of serial sections .    2.2762446568559245
furthermore , its high resolution allows the recording of structural differences as low as 10 mm .    2.1583572551895767
thus , three - dimensional analysis in combination with histological evaluation of cellular dynamics facilitates earlier and easier recording of changes of cancellous bone .    2.3262358689664966
the aneurysmal bone cyst represents a tumorlike lesion , which does not occur frequently .    2.431631328342046
every site of the skeleton may be involved .    3.087424176337871
although it can be observed at any age , it distinctly UNK from 10 to 20 years of age .    2.636846349895516
distinction of aneurysmatic bone cysts from certain benign or malignant bone tumours requires subtle imaging techniques and an experienced bone tumour pathologist .    2.057196232278302
since the lesion shows a heterogeneous biological behaviour and typically occurs in the growing skeleton , a wide range of surgical procedures must be provided concerning tumour resection and defect reconstruction .    2.3341212668098947
in the current retrospective study results of 41 surgically treated aneurysmal bone cysts , thereof 5 latent , 31 active , and 5 aggressive lesions , were investigated .    2.1802367310003454
while morbidity due to the therapeutic measures was comparatively low even in extended lesions and demanding reconstructions , a recurrence rate of 19 . 5 % had to be observed in our series .    2.880152437316781
taking into consideration the biological activity of the lesion , analysis of the recurrences revealed inappropriate surgical margins had been chosen at the primary operation in all of these patients .    2.549488075475065
since the risk of a local relapse is linked both to aggressiveness of the primary lesion and to surgical UNK , therapy of aneurysmal bone cyst requires preoperative staging and stage - dependent surgical procedures .    2.3002021859706314
the UNK syndrome ( remitting UNK symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema ) is a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis in the elderly with a good prognosis .    2.6658802329147777
it usually presents as an acute , symmetric UNK with edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet .    2.2719750711353073
anti - inflammatory treatment with corticosteroids leads to prompt improvement .    2.457053302914726
a thrombosis of the axillary vein was suspected .    2.955540152928998
within a few days he developed a pitting edema of the dorsum of the other hand .    2.5706102163888147
movement of both shoulders and wrists was painful .    2.47503027324118
low - dose corticosteroid therapy resulted in a rapid improvement of the edema and the inflammatory symptoms .    2.9640861794467956
the objective of this study was to determine the usefulness , safety and acceptance of a new technique of percutaneous implantation of port - catheter - systems ( UNK ) for locoregional intraarterial chemotherapy of the liver .    2.6175451798128675
from october 1994 to july 1996 , 128 patients ( 30 women , 98 men ) participated in an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation program ( phase ii ) .    2.0056586683675866
our objectives were to demonstrate risk - factor modification and increased work - load capacity resulting directly from the rehabilitation in terms of primary results and long - term effects , 6 months ( n = 59 ) and 12 months ( n = 30 ) after termination of the program .    2.704608970400411
we observed how many of the patients were able to be occupationally re - integrated after completion of phase ii rehabilitation .    2.7927088612960933
here , we present the so - called " UNK retractor " , which can be fixed on to the operating table .    3.0222675514241413
it allows an optimal transference of the traction force on to the border of the wound , both in upper and lower abdominal interventions .    2.140963236073473
in this way , as shown by our recent experience , we gain an optimal view of the UNK area and into the small pelvis .    2.695633543633193
the disaster management in germany is UNK in the constitution .    3.441614489094157
according to the german constitution the UNK of the interior of the federal states UNK the disaster management by UNK it to the city and county administrations .    2.429119073430142
these elaborate and update a special disaster management UNK , which allows a prompt flow of information to and from the administration and the person in charge of operations and guarantees a smooth collaboration on which the success of the operation depends .    2.1930348581180357
the american - european consensus conference recently recommended the following criteria for diagnosis of ards : ( 1 ) acute onset ; ( 2 ) pao2 / fio2 < = 200 mmhg regardless of peep level ; ( 3 ) bilateral infiltrates seen on frontal chest radiograph ; ( 4 ) UNK < = 18 mmhg when measured or no clinical evidence of left atrial hypertension .    2.039144375903781
pathophysiologically , ards is characterized by pulmonary edema owing to injury of the capillary - alveolar membranes and increased pulmonary artery pressure .    2.393319583135053
it is further distinguished by severe hypoxemia unresponsive to the usual methods of support for respiratory failure .    2.019367989043513
hypoxemia is caused by intrapulmonary right - to - left shunting due to to persistent perfusion of non - ventilated alveoli .    2.572534949670892
another characteristic feature in ards is the low UNK compliance .    2.4544572193189573
latest studies suggest that the incidence of the syndrome is in the range of 3 - 10 cases / 100 , 000 inhabitants / year .    3.061378067157108
mortality rates are a major concern : old and new reports continue to report mortality rates of 50 - 60 % .    2.3471298439550368
thoracic organ transplantation has evolved as standard therapy in end - stage cardiac and pulmonary failure .    2.4050877715099066
meanwhile more than 50 . 000 heart , 2500 heart - lung and 10 . 000 lung transplantations have been performed worldwide .    2.3284466794906598
improvements in patient selection as well as in the postoperative management have led to 1 - year survival rates of 70 - 90 % .    3.2920339529774845
long - term results are still influenced by the development of graft vessels disease , bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome and malignancies .    2.726544376924309
furthermore , indications and results of different UNK will be presented and new developments discussed .    2.8445906098910925
the paper focuses on the cultural history of brain death in germany in the second half of the 20th century .    2.80760057478668
it analyzes scientific and public UNK on the relevance of brain death and the importance of medical innovations in intensive care medicine .    2.817491141637589
the paper examines how the public reacted when heart transplantation led to an urgent need for a new definition of death .    2.2769170497493176
it will be shown how the concept of brain death was accepted by the public , introduced into clinical routine , and implemented through medical and legal UNK .    2.4392324487906403
finally , it will be analyzed why the public consensus on brain death was definitely questioned in the last ten years .    2.331907598535251
an understanding of the use of the concept of brain death by scientists , UNK , UNK , and the public during the last three decades may help to shed light on the social role of science in modern and late - modern societies .    3.004012942120583
background : in the course of graves ' disease ( gd ) the UNK muscles become fibrotic after an acute inflammatory stage .    2.4611025093466368
differentiation of these two stages is important for therapy .    3.22025019280966
injuries of the joints of the pelvis and of the acetabulum are still a problem even today .    3.1886356654936656
when the joints of the pelvis are damaged the risk of complicated pelvic injuries , that is to say pelvic injuries with damage to the soft tissues in and around the pelvis , is increased threefold .    2.4897479647981946
the lethality , the overall gravity of the injuries , the probability of haemorrhagic complications and the proportion of associated pelvic injuries are also increased .    2.376543334981681
even when anatomical reconstruction of the lower limb girdle is achieved , long - term secondary conditions such as pain and genitourinary and neurological UNK frequently persist .    2.6493377056369454
complicated pelvic injuries , i . e . pelvic injury with concomitant damage to organs and soft tissues in the pelvis and pelvic injuries with ipsilateral femoral fracture ( floating hip ) are special cases .    2.1612786545150033
haemodynamic stabilization of the patient and the treatment of organic lesions must be the first priorities in the interdisciplinary therapy .    3.120761880522566
even when these priorities are correctly observed , the lethality is almost three times as high as in the case of pelvic injuries not involving soft - tissue damage .    2.2804859091653205
acetabular fractures are a particular challenge even compared with other joint fractures .    2.346743912537207
operative treatment with anatomical joint reconstruction and stable internal fixation has been shown to have the best results .    2.657686573069939
in addition to the type of fracture and the personal experience of the surgeon concerned , such fracture - specific factors as the presence of further fractures of the posterior wall , comminuted fractures , joint depression fractures and intra - articular fragments increasingly play a part .    2.5296048851185566
the primary cartilaginous damage caused by the accident seems to have a considerable influence on the long - term result following acetabular fractures .    3.052270736236278
two - dimensional conventional x - rays and computer tomographic imaging systems contribute to the diagnosis and surgical planning of patients with orofacial malformations .    3.0383245501325824
the ability to UNK ct scans into three - dimensional osseous and soft tissue surface images has a significant impact on the diagnosis and management of orofacial malformations .    2.753929576184872
cephalometric evaluation with UNK provides precise insight into both the skeletal structures and the soft parts , enabling the radiologist to assess the relationship among the different parts in a given subject , at any given time and in relation to the normal .    2.188102342089201
the purpose of this study was to check the precision of the dräger vaporizer model 19 . 3 when filled with three different preparations of isoflurane .    2.112669441168397
background : since there is no epidemiologic assessment of the frequency of pain caused by tumor in germany , tumor - pain - prevalence is estimated indirectly on the basis of mortality and median survival .    2.855955274284032
knowing that about 50 % of all patients having metastases or incurable locoregional recurrence suffer from pain every day , the product of median survival times mortality was calculated to achieve the number of patients ' days with tumor - caused pain per year ( 82 . 710 . UNK days in germany 1995 ) .    2.1793213030195013
by division with UNK ( days ) , it is calculated that 226 . UNK patients require tumor pain related treatment at one day in germany .    2.4553196291282435
another calculation based on UNK ' s publications that 60 - 90 % of patients suffering from advanced cancer are having pain and based on an estimated tumor prevalence 1989 / 90 revealed a tumor pain prevalence of 221 . UNK .    2.5170579410528116
laser catheters which run UNK on a guide wire were developed for UNK of luminal gain by excimer laser angioplasty ( elca ) .    2.1665182023049443
we investigated the safety and efficacy of elca with these new catheters plus ptca in patients with UNK or occlusions in coronary stents .    2.66819415263198
the age of standardized instrumented scoliosis correction and stabilization began with UNK instrumentation ( hi ) .    2.2242866973095476
with hi , satisfactory long - term correction of the frontal plane averaged approximately 50 % , but without UNK UNK capabilities . the distraction of the concavity leads to reduction of the sagittal contour of the spine ( flat back ) , which is biomechanically disadvantageous .    2.730387572023825
the newer UNK attached implant systems avoid this disadvantage .    2.1935032689807255
the first prototypes of these systems were UNK - ( UNK ) and UNK - UNK instrumentation .    3.5147245647902836
ideal indications for posterior instrumented curve correction are structural idiopathic double major curves and flexible single curves .    1.9363249755011547
however , even with these newer UNK systems derotation is low , because derotation is , without any doubt , related to anterior release and thus decoupling of the segments by means of disc resection .    2.1902201682885902
UNK syndromes as causes of diseases underlying chronic UNK and keratoconjunctivitis that are refractory to treatment are often difficult to recognize .    2.1114916787099824
the surgical correction of a tandem stenosis of the carotid artery is sometimes difficult , especially if the second stenosis is near or above the skull base .    2.489831399154102
however , the potential advantages of these endovascular techniques warrant continued evaluation .    2.352157545624147
the application of these techniques in carotid artery tandem stenoses presents specific problems and dangers .    2.3926664967893485
we discuss the case of a 78 - year - old man with severe carotid stenoses on both sides and an additional symptomatic tandem stenosis above the skull base on the right side .    2.4691601166020427
after the surgical correction of the left carotid artery using standard endarterectomy , we performed endarterectomy on the right side in combination with an open stent implantation .    3.009459650562176
the periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis are also known as koenen tumors .    2.198282521531293
UNK UNK UNK koenen was born on march 10 , 1893 , in UNK and died in bois - le - UNK may 29 , UNK .    2.2372464397120746
from 1910 to UNK he studied medicine at the university of amsterdam .    2.4665506743370536
then he worked as a physician at the " UNK " asylum in UNK and from UNK in the " UNK " asylum in UNK .    3.2896438042697316
in UNK he published his publication concerning a family with tuberous sclerosis in which UNK of periungual fibromas are shown .    2.077563574082935
his thesis in 1933 at the university in UNK was UNK " UNK in children .    2.496801884784829
its importance in UNK and social regard , by reason of an investigation in some UNK in UNK - UNK " .    3.291939992619105
later he was UNK director of a state mental institution .    2.3114847976192334
the periungual fibromas in tuberous sclerosis were first described by UNK UNK in munich in UNK .    2.6234136875969445
parallel with the increasing number of coronary stent implantation procedures , new or more elaborate coronary stents were introduced into clinical use almost every month in 1996 .    2.2587953893614934
we have studied the architecture , surface - morphology , and shape - conversion of 16 different coronary stent systems .    1.97982830761125
the objective of our study was to detect possible specific design and surface features which might influence the healing process , UNK restenosis , and stent thrombosis .    2.1660782259669116
using electron microscopy we found UNK surfaces on 5 stents .    2.203746534560975
all other coronary stents revealed individually varying and partly sharp - UNK surface irregularities .    2.071507920129133
video - based morphometry showed covering between 8 . 3 % and 26 . 4 % .    2.8001085454775456
in some stent systems balloon dilation lead to over - expansion of the stent UNK .    2.17416833999519
this over - expansion mounted up to 20 % of the balloon diameter and the stents revealed a rather UNK than homogenous expansion pattern .    2.371076559109242
this phenomenon was also found after UNK stent implantation in 20 autopsied hearts .    2.4418177453524854
unilateral hearing loss ( hl ) caused by an acoustic neuroma ( an ) is regarded to be neural ( " non - cochlear " ) .    2.2710495224739673
by using otoacoustic emissions it is possible to prove concurrent sensory ( cochlear ) hl .    2.2621890166294785
we prefer distortion - product otoacoustic emissions ( dpoae ) because these are more frequency - specific and stable .    2.1077906882481385
from april 1994 to may 1996 , we examined preoperatively 24 patients with radiologically proven an .    2.5044098857924704
pure - tone audiometry , dp - grams , brainstem - evoked response audiometry ( bera ) and vestibular studies were performed in all cases , while special auditory tests ( UNK , UNK ) and short increment sensitivity indices were also performed in 12 cases .    2.4387486967403498
bera was pathological in 23 cases and latencies were borderline in one case .    2.3693287491830453
after comparing UNK and dp - grams we found 13 patients with sensory hl , 4 patients with combined sensorineural hl and 7 patients with neural hl .    2.1732355804431407
there was a strong correlation between the results of dpoae and the results of special auditory test ( = 0 . 63 ) whereas there was no correlation between tumor size and cochlear function .    3.048187814256136
the result showed that the typical hl caused by an was a combined sensorineural loss .    2.640645150981489
dpoae were not suited for the detection of an but were able to give exact information about any remaining cochlear function .    2.54053698545692
the monoclonal dominant malignant t cells in mycosis UNK ( mf ) carry identical tcr rearrangements .    2.019749480845398
their detection is a useful diagnostic tool .    2.907271356335753
thus , in routine diagnosis we investigated the occurrence of monoclonal t cells in skin biopsy samples of mf - patients by tcr - pcr , followed by temperature gradient gel electrophoresis ( UNK ) .    2.35497791803313
in 188 out of 208 mf patients , at least one skin sample with sufficient dna quality for pcr analysis was obtained .    2.0930633975812314
applying a consensus pcr for the tcr genes vi and j 1 / 2 , we detected monoclonal t cells in 122 cases ( 65 % ) .    2.11420858909336
in the remaining 66 cases , we performed two multiplex - UNK , covering rearrangements of the other tcr genes .    2.6851372534036484
here we found in 11 cases ( 6 % ) predominant clonal rearrangements of vii - iv and j 1 / 2 and in 2 ( 1 % ) those of vi - iv and j p1 / 2 .    2.4434011349581306
in 53 of the patients ( 28 % ) the applied methods revealed no monoclonal t cells .    2.9113253978169626
this may be due to a low cell number , oligoclonal nature , chromosomal UNK or remaining of tcr in germline configuration .    2.2326444914301464
despite significant improvements in early detection of hearing losses in children , a relatively long interval still exists from initial concern by families to definite audiological identification .    2.090381956815498
the aim of our retrospective cross - sectional study was to identify parental factors contributing to the delay of early detection .    2.5932722395689645
the parents of 70 hearing - impaired children were interviewed .    2.332602697917692
all children were fitted with hearing aids in our clinical and had no additional physical or cognitive disabilities .    2.259942995471442
at an average age of 19 . 5 months , parents or family doctors noticed first signs of a possible hearing impairment .    2.694299785312575
on average it then took an additional 7 . 2 months until hearing impairment was diagnosed by an expert and the necessary first steps taken for rehabilitation ( fitting of hearing aids ) .    2.0667330098912786
significantly , total hearing loss or profound hearing impairments were detected earlier than mild or moderate hearing impairments .    1.969389439605054
in addition to hearing loss , parental education correlated significantly with an earlier start of rehabilitation .    2.265438525050672
statistical analysis revealed that children with hearing - impaired close relatives as well as first - born children tended to be diagnosed later .    2.5967768297842584
to further improve secondary prevention of hearing loss , the competence of specific parental groups should be taken into consideration .    2.28815600647662
after the incidental puncture of a UNK of the UNK trunk during a subclavian vein catheterization , a symptomatic av - fistula UNK .    2.829924350635671
the diagnosis was confirmed by angiography .    2.7969074219065218
using a microcatheter system the fistula was occluded with UNK .    2.3973837777976468
this prospective study was designed to compare quality of life , life satisfaction , and subjective ratings of health before and at variable time intervals after heart transplantation ( htx ) .    2.2446050561197994
175 patients were included between february 1994 and december 1997 .    2.776446071931604
every six months before and 1 , 5 , 3 , 6 , and 12 months after htx , they received the following standardized and validated questionnaires : german sf 36 , heart failure and specific transplant symptom list , global quality of life assessment , munich life quality dimension list , expected / experienced life changes after htx , good UNK of the german language , and a minimum age of 18 years .    2.5362190555808892
during data evaluation , median ( UNK ) , mean ( m ) , and standard deviation ( sd ) were created from individual parameters .    3.028004352731098
quality of life was rated as very poor by 84 % of patients with congestive heart failure .    2.73108203387022
before htx 80 % were very UNK about their health status and 87 % about physical performance .    2.131724039661125
six weeks after htx , this parameter improved significantly and 76 % were very satisfied about their health status and 50 % about physical performance .    2.1226699999534935
while somatic changes expected before htx corresponded well with experienced ones , psychological improvements were smaller than expected , but one year after htx they were significant ( before : m = 3 . 66 ; sd = 0 . 9 ; range ( r ) = 3 . 78 vs 12 months postop : m = 4 . 61 ; sd = 0 . 6 ; r = 2 . 67 ; p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.097410457980169
quality of life correlated before htx best with subjectively rated health ( r = 0 . 61 , p < 0 . 01 ) and 6 months after with satisfaction about health status ( r = 0 . 76 , p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.3241178477245925
only in 25 % were expected improvements fulfilled regarding sexual activity / satisfaction , professional situation , and recreational activities .    2.064638466068253
90 % of UNK patients reported physical UNK , most by effects of immunsuppression , but were coping well .    2.627396596459557
the study shows that already 6 weeks after successful htx all quality of life parameters improved significantly .    2.6500008002919895
despite some UNK expectations and complaints , the postoperative life situation of htx patients appeared significantly improved .    2.0641517805579968
sevoflurane is a " new " volatile inhaled anaesthetic .    2.4424929691741437
owing to its lower blood - gas solubility coefficient , emergence from anaesthesia is faster with sevoflurane than with isoflurane , enflurane , or halothane .    1.9772848268966896
sevoflurane undergoes metabolic biodegradation , releasing inorganic fluoride ions that could produce nephrotoxicity .    2.0031558297248475
in this study , we compared serum inorganic fluoride concentrations ( UNK ) in patients receiving either sevoflurane or enflurane .    2.7340678005976167
furthermore , indices of renal function were evaluated until the 3rd postoperative day .    2.264459885701168
background : rarely , an additional brown ' s syndrome develops spontaneously in cases of posttraumatic bilateral superior oblique palsy .    2.462158001037045
surgical measures are controversial and problematic .    2.5733150112402856
metastasis formation is a UNK process that requires tumor cells to progress through many different stages .    2.644852916335713
one of the first steps is a disturbance of the epithelial integrity through a decrease in intercellular UNK adhesion .    2.848292716971517
proteolysis of the extracellular matrix , as well as increased UNK , leads to intravasation and dissemination of the tumor cells .    2.9185932704323827
in the target organs metastasizing cells adhere to the endothelium , UNK and form metastases .    2.5649111579496635
this leads to the conclusion that anti - proteolytic and anti - angiogenic substances could provide effective therapeutic approaches for the control of metastatic growth .    2.2469990361566414
whether or not this goal can be accomplished by synthetic or endogenous drugs must still be demonstrated by basic and definitive clinical research .    2.163660420272714
purpose : the purpose of this study was to present our experience and results with arthroscopic resection of the acromioclavicular joint .    2.653466149416298
urodynamic examinations were performed in 82 patients with clinically localized prostate cancer before and after radical prostatectomy .    2.8870763594615085
a significant decrease in bladder capacity ( UNK ml to 331 . 9 ml ) , urethral closure pressure ( 89 . 6 cm h2o to 65 . , 2 cm h2o ) and functional profile length ( 61 mm to 25 . 9 mm ) was noted .    2.2641580317791594
the continence rate after radical prostatectomy was 33 . 4 % after 1 month , 69 . 4 % after 3 months , 84 . 7 % after 6 months , and 90 . 9 % after 12 months , respectively .    3.0676297854368078
a correlation was found between urethral closure pressure and functional profile length and continence .    2.3274167412311084
a second urodynamic examination was performed 6 months after radical prostatectomy .    2.6471710373549904
functional profile length and urethral closure pressure increased .    2.6032723430903224
these data suggest that restoration of continence is based on UNK parameters .    2.882575047798646
we are interested in the interaction of high - energy ultrasound with biological tissue with regard to cancer therapy .    2.6855186887575346
the physical and biological aspects of this are reviewed and summarized in this paper .    2.7965808828323895
the preliminary results give reason to hope , as ultrasound is easy to UNK and might be applicable as a supplementary therapeutic technique in ultrasound - accessible tumors .    2.144406034071488
therefore , it is possible to calculate and predict the biological effects .    2.685605207469438
recent results have shown the potential of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring ultrasound therapy online .    2.7242860070330006
the capability of mri to measure temperature will be an important tool for the safe and reliable application of this new therapeutic approach .    2.6638615879850174
the role of ultrasound therapy in the management of human tumors must be clarified in carefully conducted clinical trials .    2.4790204460745633
posttraumatic deformities after pediatric fractures are either the result of incomplete or failed remodeling , complete or partial stimulation of the growth plates , or complete or partial closure of a growth plate .    2.233429993511013
in contrast to fractures of the upper extremities , spontaneous remodeling should not be intentionally integrated in the treatment algorithm .    3.1366804501347514
in the context of the quality assurance program of the german pension insurance institutions , instruments and procedures have been developed in the past few years in order to assess the quality of structure , process , and results of inpatient rehabilitation , as well as patient satisfaction .    3.0647201562416164
the routine implementation of these procedures aims at providing rehabilitation hospitals with fast information on UNK in their current practice , so that concepts of treatment and - in the long run - effects of rehabilitation can be systematically improved .    2.3803511441637526
when the " quality profiles " of rehabilitation hospitals are compared ( " UNK " ) , paying institutions of rehabilitation could gain information on the cost - quality - ratio of particular hospitals as well as important leads for improving the steering processes of patients and hospitals .    2.4266404081779527
in the present article , results of a first " field - run " of the procedures for measuring patient satisfaction and quality of rehabilitation processes are reported .    2.6758127132426663
in several UNK of patient satisfaction , however , significant differences between hospitals were found .    3.082862150543718
quality of rehabilitation processes - as assessed by a standardized peer - review - varied substantially between 36 hospitals .    2.073725251898404
problems of quality were found especially in some dimensions that must be considered as crucial for rehabilitation , e . g . , in the history and diagnosis of disabilities , in the consideration of psycho - social problems , or in the assessment of occupational capacities .    2.754046649671835
the analysis of thr - failures showed that the acetabular component still is the main problem of total hip replacement .    2.864745582404361
the acetabular cup fails more often than the stem .    2.4282063128679425
in the midterm analysis the failure rate is a little bit higher in cementless than in cement fixed cups .    2.150860003663158
the known effect that the failure rate of cups fixed with cement increases UNK 8 to 10 years after implantation , could of course not be seen in this study .    2.3753765111042915
the success of the cementless fixation was negatively influenced by the diagnosis rheumatoid arthritis , age over 70 and the fixation manner : the failure rate of threaded cups was higher than the one of UNK cups although the zweymüller - cup as well as the link type v - cup showed good results .    2.2888559308866854
some implants showed compared to others significantly worse results .    2.3611501483796666
the further implantation should be thought of , what partially has already happened .    2.0887959525145074
the results of cementless stem fixation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthrosis and dysplastic osteoarthritis is comparable , so that cementless fixation should be thought of in case of adequate conditions ( ability of partial weight bearing for some weeks , age under 60 ) .    2.3134676998067825
type i and type ii diabetes are the most common types of diabetes .    3.205038512276942
the ratio of type i to type ii diabetes is about 1 : 9 .    2.822216453935082
type i diabetes is caused by an absolute insulin deficiency and is therefore referred to as insulin - dependent diabetes . the disease becomes manifest clinically in childhood or adolescence ( " juvenile diabetes " ) , although manifestation in adulthood is being increasingly observed .    2.2258984338196863
morphologically , a subtotal ( > 80 % ) to total loss of beta cells in the pancreatic UNK occurs .    2.4727280555910136
lymphocytic insulitis , which UNK after the beta cells have been totally destroyed , is pathognomonic of type i diabetes .    2.4175147866472417
this insulitis is an expression of an autoimmune event that is triggered by a multitude of factors .    2.3814862021476455
an important factor appears to be a genetic predisposition ( hla UNK / UNK / UNK ) in connection with as yet unknown environmental factors ( e . g . , viruses ) .    2.961116050527371
autoantibodies , such as islet cell cytoplasmic antibodies ( ica ) , insulin autoantibodies ( UNK ) , and / or autoantibodies to the UNK - UNK enzyme UNK acid UNK ( UNK ) , are already detectable in a UNK phase , although it is not possible to predict the time of clinical manifestion .    3.494785052774841
the course of the disease is dependent on age .    3.3209693241596097
young children require insulin therapy sooner than juveniles or adults .    2.148100031647788
this article summarizes data from recent studies on the prevalence , diagnosis and therapy of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome ( osas ) in children .    2.612841242094379
the prevalence of this disorder in 4 - 6 year old children is 0 . 7 % .    3.1366470950957037
leading clinical sign in 90 % of patients is habitual snoring , but this is rather nonspecific , as 60 % of patients investigated for habitual snoring do not have osas .    2.715227924668943
patients with progressive cancer and their families face a series of existential crises with each stage of disease up to terminal stages in which palliative treatment is begun , and patients come to accept the UNK of death .    2.2435680212338776
this can lead to a unique , highly emotional situation with direct or indirect , open or hidden , varied and very personal manifestations .    2.028419516712369
the dermatological clinic in homburg was founded in 1945 .    2.242343508171416
in 1947 it was integrated into the saarland university as a dermatology department .    2.1451250430283686
a review of the history of the clinic documents advances and challenges in clinical dermatology , as well as new developments in related basic research during the last 50 years .    2.563053788566081
the coexistence of carotid artery stenosis with coronary artery disease occurs in a small percentage of patients requiring open heart surgical procedures .    2.7411540584682883
whether the combined surgical approach favorably influences the outcome of patients requiring major cardiac operations remains controversial .    2.4010613649505284
we report the successful thrombectomy of the internal carotid artery .    2.2817382775992114
a 33 - year - old woman suffered from ovarian UNK syndrome after treatment with fsh / hcg for in - vitro fertilization .    2.4330875251237143
she developed a transient left hemiparesis .    2.554993028226449
this was caused by a floating thrombus located in the internal carotid artery .    3.10539541524035
open surgical treatment with thrombectomy prevents recurrent neurological symptoms .    2.5622295738277394
the development of hand eczema is a relatively commonly seem dermatosis in UNK .    2.4288788139725637
in 1986 we presented a first survey of potential contact dermatitis sources for a housewife .    2.104341247526945
now , we present an update in which we analyse the different contact sources in the UNK and grade them in comparison to the data of 1986 .    3.0519045085293137
the results are based on the analysis of a large population of UNK patients with the occupation " housewife " and the diagnosis " eczema " who have been seen in departments of dermatology belonging to the information network of departments of dermatology ( ivdk ) .    2.6144196188410493
data for hiv infection on transmission probabilities per contact are of widely differing quality .    2.0401173217852984
estimates of infection probabilities after sexual exposures are the most problematic , even though sexual exposure is the most frequent transmission risk .    2.6070210559744833
UNK of data from UNK couple cohort studies and from us UNK studies may be seriously UNK .    2.1053902327136638
infectivity of and susceptibility to hiv may be influenced by concomitant stds , antiretroviral therapy , UNK and / or UNK virus exposures and thus may show a wide range of inter - and intraindividual variability .    2.42639365328179
differences in factors influencing transmission probability of hiv most likely outweigh differences in sexual behaviour in explaining the differences in epidemic spread of hiv .    2.109606917765671
between january 1989 and march 1997 , 175 patients with traumatic shoulder dislocations were treated by conservative means ( median age 41 years , 39 f , 136 m ) .    2.153150713320544
in 78 patients ( 17 f , 61 m ) a clinical and radiological follow up ( median 50 months , range 6 - 106 ) could be obtained .    2.525452995688194
additionally , a diagnostic ultrasound was carried out in all patients .    2.802159665857377
the recurrence rate in the group younger than 30 years ( g < 30 ; n = 35 ) was 86 % ; in the group older than 30 years ( g > 30 ; n = 43 ) it was 21 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.469704725461545
persisting neurological deficits were found in 6 patients ( 8 % ) .    2.9591795066495585
according to the rowe score , 16 patients ( 46 % ) of the g < 30 achieved excellent or good results , in the g > 30 , 29 patients ( 67 % ) .    2.938793977566577
in 17 % of cases , a glenohumeral arthrosis was diagnosed be radiological means .    2.754555117247486
18 % had radiological signs of a previous fracture of the greater tuberosity .    2.8555785655347554
hill - sachs lesions were identified in 19 % of cases .    2.8633510229394212
rotator cuff tears were diagnosed in 9 % by ultrasound .    2.838011454743962
no relationship between the duration of immobilization and the recurrence rate was found ( p = 0 . 95 ) .    3.0945649808319198
the recurrence rate following primary shoulder dislocation depends primarily on the patients ' age .    2.487128358021207
we analyzed quality assurance protocol records of UNK geriatric hospital patients in comparison to an administration database concerning data on " length of stay " information ( los ) .    2.186729397500748
doctors handwritten quality assurance protocol records corresponded in 74 . 25 % of cases to administration data .    2.604588681734558
14 . 47 % of cases were registered with different los ; 11 . 28 % of los information was missing .    2.59053778651378
the increasing amount of documentation tasks in german geriatric hospitals is discussed .    2.224032294787587
conclusion : we assume that not only discrete well known information ( admission and discharge dates , los ) are contaminated by documentation failure but also data on functional status of geriatric patients which may have important influence on external data processing .    1.9244701389285208
the majority of patients with symptomatic spondylolysis can be treated conservatively .    3.0547551100230828
only when symptoms persist in spite of conservative treatment surgery may be indicated .    2.6844127488975795
in young patients , however , fusion of a mobile segment should be avoided , but a direct repair of the pars defect can be attempted .    2.9395513635444255
this procedure allows complete healing and possibly avoids degeneration of the intervertebral disk .    2.3851285117418546
for this purpose UNK developed the hook screw , which connects the arch with the anterior articular process .    1.9534498158406375
it allows compression of the defect without crossing the defect with the screw .    2.5839205759201964
a follow - up study of the first 33 patients with a follow - up time of 3 . 5 years on average showed a good subjective result in 79 % of the patients .    3.526828041518148
in patients younger than 20 years of age , however , the result was good in 87 . 5 % of cases .    3.3955689992600138
direct repair of spondylolysis is therefore indicated when pain persists after 6 months of conservative treatment or there is a progressive UNK of not more than 10 mm .    2.626257577457225
after the end of growth an mri study of the intervertebral discs should show whether there is degeneration or not .    2.481995190747684
direct repair is indicated only in the absence of disc degeneration .    3.2645201196497484
after the age of 25 years this procedure should not be carried out .    3.1490817150121053
we are presenting a 47 - year - old woman who was UNK by jellyfish while bathing in the sea of UNK .    2.228504157711632
immediately after the injury she developed sharp pain and urticarial erythema of the skin of the knees accompanied by muscle UNK of the entire body .    2.9059976410927852
after a few days a toxic contact dermatitis with edematous swelling and ulcerations developed , which did not respond to topical antibiotics or corticosteroids .    2.260321505300668
three weeks later the patient presented with a disseminated urticarial eruption , which at first responded well to topical treatment and systemic corticosteroids .    2.37366091253058
over the next few weeks , however , a relapse of the eruption and the ulcerations occurred .    2.812919573224748
raised UNK of igg and igm antibodies against different jellyfish from the UNK and UNK UNK were detected in the patient ' s serum by the enzyme - linked UNK assay .    2.9728631735532702
antibodies against UNK ( class 1 ) and UNK ( class 4 ) were found by the radioallergosorbent test .    3.0177388001772187
the clinical features and the immunological findings led to the diagnosis of toxic and allergic contact dermatitis to jellyfish venom .    2.7348329927444146
first aid and secondary treatment of jellyfish injuries are suggested .    2.279370319566286
the design of controlled clinical trials on prevention and therapy of arrhythmic events is a difficult task .    2.6171801809831026
in particular in icd trials , false estimations and UNK have occured that can compromise the interpretation of a trial .    2.3420557494657825
identification of crucial issues that should be regulated in a study protocol in order to minimize the risk of failure .    2.824818673740284
evaluation of the weaknesses of completed antiarrhythmic trials .    2.6638999776701575
problems in the specification of indications and in the estimation of the effective sample size cannot be solved by the inclusion of mixed populations but require the establishment of development programs .    2.5028820540707892
further crucial points are the appropriate choice of control and the identical concomittant treatment and observation of the groups to be compared .    2.26319483692975
technical UNK as UNK definitions , arbitrary decisions during the course or at termination of a trial , unclear responsibilities or an unscheduled flow of information can be avoided if these potential problems are anticipated in the trial protocol .    2.1033157308652517
a prospective approach that anticipates problems at the time the study protocol is UNK is preferable to a reluctant reactive approach during the course of the trial .    2.4965020396013347
ultrasound is the primary imaging modality after kidney transplantation .    2.6404111432866437
its general availability and the absence of radiation exposure and discomfort for the patient also make it a suitable procedure for follow - up .    2.5848560255258772
simple b - mode sonography provides comprehensive information on the morphology of the renal transplant and surrounding structures , while color - coded duplex sonography ( ccds ) additionally allows assessment of the anastomoses and organ perfusion .    2.2451519015082564
more recent technical advances such as power doppler ultrasound appear to improve in particular the assessment of peripheral circulation .    2.1801767341029588
the possibilities and limitations of the various sonographic techniques in the evaluation of kidney transplants are discussed with special reference to the most important clinical aspects and some basic technical concepts .    2.945067540968758
purpose : the first morphological changes in eyes with hiv infection are microvascular disease of the retina with UNK - UNK spots and UNK .    2.6316643580747057
the study was performed to find out if evidence of disturbances of ocular microcirculation can be established by non - invasive methods .    2.955310480556171
the operative realignment of mechanical axis deviations ( mad ) is necessary to prevent early joint degeneration and to reach normal load - bearing .    2.2262478710813647
modern types of external fixation systems allow an alignment of the mechanical axis to exact degrees .    2.3064892668635757
predominantly this are corrections of angular deformities .    2.4250841098530875
in some cases the analysis of the mad does not show any angular deformity , but a parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines of a bone .    2.5052416724485687
such parallel staggering of the mechanical axis lines is defined as a translation deformity of the bone .    2.515755980655953
in combined deformities with angulation and translation the centre of deformity can be established proximal or distal out of the limit of the bone .    2.3598363914366174
in translation deformities the realignment of the mechanical axis requires a parallel re - staggering made by a translation - osteotomy or by a UNK double osteotomy .    2.1391094226685228
in complex deformities with angulation and translation , the translation requires a separate corrective planning .    2.0361217818225255
by using external fixator systems to perform acute or progressive corrective osteotomies the position of the axis of correction of angulation ( aca ) in relation to the n - cora of the deformity has to be considered .    2.3071890321091484
if aca position is not conform with the n - cora position relevant geometric effects in relation of length and translation occur .    2.0006354041532757
these geometric effects to corrective osteotomies can be calculated by using simple UNK formulas or UNK methods .    2.034674411125586
possibilities to compensate translation and length effects are shown by using unilateral external fixator systems .    2.183308172126191
the employers ' liability insurance association for victuallers and UNK victuallers has been controlling healing procedures with the aid of a computer program for several years .    1.9785519932263165
the personal data of the injured patient and the precise diagnosis of the injury are used to prepare a forecast of the duration of the treatment and of the patient ' s inability to work .    3.6287625490776767
the basis of this forecast is provided by tables integrated in the program , which have been elaborated by experts on trauma medicine and also constantly refined by them .    2.207082662972572
meanwhile numerous insurance companies concerned with accidents and trauma have acquired the program and are intending to use it .    1.9996532125720776
it is intended that its evaluation will help to guarantee the quality of concomitant treatment of trauma victims and also yield some indications on how best to realize the UNK of institutions concerned with acute treatment and rehabilitation .    2.2576637851079875
stroke and its consequences are under medical , UNK and socioeconomic aspects one of the biggest contemporary challenges .    2.911935515382566
due to the demographic development the importance of this disease will further increase .    2.9581469498802924
nonetheless acute therapy of ischemic stroke up to now was marked by therapeutic nihilism and adherence to empiric therapeutic procedures .    2.2153750663224048
the good profit - risk - ratio of early thrombolysis with rt - pa could be confirmed by further studies lately .    2.398299220992812
in the meantime this therapy was officially recommended by the aha in the importance of grade a recommendation .    2.431708874507713
at present only few patients receive such a treatment .    2.4559336489347023
a thrombolytic therapy can only be provided by a minority of centers due to high requirement in infra - structure .    2.4176390731446635
furthermore clinic admission often appears with immense loss of time .    2.1407370227546685
unfortunately also within the clinics there are relevant latencies until therapeutic intervention .    2.192585112331644
therefore fundamental requirements for thrombolytic therapy are the UNK of potentially suitable patients and the rapid transfer to an appropriate clinic .    2.6406709304139464
a 69 - year - old patient with reduced pulmonary function was diagnosed as suffering from non - small cell lung cancer of the left lung invading the main bronchus , pulmonary artery and left atrium .    2.5932582346622164
using cardiopulmonary bypass , an extended pneumonectomy with partial resection of the left atrium was performed .    2.817508069026217
the cardiac defect was closed with a pericardial patch .    2.3647065275260437
the lower lobe was divided ex situ from the upper lobe and reimplanted with anastomosis of the lower pulmonary vein to the left UNK .    2.3160337339816204
after a totally uneventful course the patient is in good condition and free of tumor recurrence 2 . 5 years postoperatively .    2.7306718083220654
in this retrospective study we report the indications , complications and functional and cosmetic results after dermofat grafting into UNK orbits .    2.5749653171166744
the method consists of implantation of autogenous dermis with attached subcutaneous fat from the gluteal region into the orbit .    2.0136391860826732
twenty - four primary and 4 secondary grafts were implanted in 28 patients aged 12 to 49 years .    2.1914568451450753
in the explantation site one patient showed delayed healing .    2.229470058196978
all implants became integrated , none were lost because of infection or UNK .    2.3341281919887478
eleven patients developed minor complications like central ulceration in the dermis , hair growth on the dermis or suture granuloma .    1.9992512102513647
in the primary implant group the functional and cosmetic outcome was evaluated by measurements of the lid structures , UNK ( UNK ) and measuring the prosthesis motility ( UNK ) .    2.792021601716544
three patients showed fair results ; all the others had good or very good results .    2.3638640814205276
in one case of a secondary implant marked graft atrophy was observed .    2.622839301713645
despite the more extensive surgery and some minor complications the safety of this method with good functional and cosmetic results makes dermofat grafting an excellent alternative to heterogenous orbital implants .    2.1794189394037082
liver tissue from 14 female patients with primary biliary cirrhosis ( pbc ; stages i - iv ) was systematically investigated for the prevalence and distribution of dendritic antigen - presenting cells .    2.1221683913627714
dendritic cells ( dcs ) were immunhistochemically identified by use of anti - s 100 protein and kimlp antibodies .    2.47452798981158
we confirm previous findings that , in early pbc , s 100 protein - positive dcs can be detected within the lining of bile duct epithelia .    2.2546282905198805
however , the present study disclosed that s 100 protein - and kimlp - positive dcs regularly occur in UNK necroses ( pmns ) developing in pbc - associated chronic hepatitis .    2.0548974939028937
dcs in pmns were observed in all pbc stages , but were most prominent in late - stage pbc .    2.4584041098537086
these findings suggest that autoimmune tissue damage in pbc may not be limited to bile ducts , but may also ensue in hepatic parenchyma , producing the pattern of chronic hepatitis with signs of activity .    2.127474555454624
health care in emergencies is a social good and a hallmark of a UNK society , the ethical foundations of which have to form the basis of all decisions regarding medical emergencies .    2.357925470521839
the ethics of emergency medical care are part of general medical ethics .    2.505813556171718
their principles are outlined and put into perspective with regard to UNK characteristic of emergency care .    2.397294016629075
due to dwindling resources , the efficiency of emergency medical care is being increasingly scrutinized .    2.4950061232539524
possibilities of UNK care without compromising its quality are being discussed , such as UNK UNK therapy and implementing measures of prevention .    2.4455562429734865
if emergency medical services are to accomplish their UNK , however , observing standards of medical practice , legal provisions , and the given framework of society , they must not UNK to pure cost containment .    2.424105955030946
we performed a phase ii trial with second - line chemotherapy in patients with refractory , metastatic cancer of the bladder .    2.8064653038496816
second - line therapy consists of 2 . 6 cycles of mitomycin - c , 5 - fluorouracil and folic acid .    2.6400736266010445
two patients suffered from who grade iii side effects ( nephrotoxicity , UNK ) .    2.6395895973171046
we did not find any complete or partial remission .    2.619847202030185
four patients had a stable disease ; 3 . 3 months after therapy , patients developed tumor progression with a median survival of 9 months .    2.867728168708587
four patients reported an improvement in quality of life .    2.7759397517937123
since all patients received supportive care , improvement in quality of life cannot be related to chemotherapy alone .    2.596639653139523
in conclusion , second - line chemotherapy with mitomycin - c , 5 - fluorouracil and folic acid has no effect on refractory , metastatic cancer of the bladder and is no alternative for cisplatin and methotrexate - based chemotherapy .    1.92171022006997
every form of active euthanasia is a UNK offence under § 216 of the UNK code ; nor is there any ethical justification for it from a medical point of view .    2.2560884651224287
the many strands of the movement in favour of making " death on demand " UNK from UNK in germany as it is in the netherlands cannot change this .    2.3776324306111203
thus far , re - esterification has been detected in at least 83 cases .    2.6089008836403207
the 2 - month period of strict contraception initially recommended after oral intake of trans - acitretin has been extended to 2 years , as with etretinate .    2.302864881002096
we review some aspects of trans - acitretin metabolism , with special emphasis on etretinate formation .    2.4023029458363254
re - esterification of trans - acitretin into etretinate takes place under varying conditions in volunteers and patients , as well as in animal models .    2.4063245073380033
ethanol is a co - factor for the UNK re - esterification of trans - acitretin .    2.5629054881522784
it is unclear whether the introduction of trans - acitretin has been of any significant benefit to patients .    2.446344447398204
monitoring of plasma retinoid levels during and after retinoid therapy remains of decisive importance in managing difficult cases and or in UNK decisions for pregnancy .    2.0240058370424383
the purpose of this study was to compare the midterm results of the conservative treatment of anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) ruptures in athletes .    2.4823467362850837
during 1989 and 1990 , UNK athletes with acl ruptures were treated in our sports surgery department , and 221 of them were suitable for inclusion in the study .    2.1246825102056874
the patients were divided into two groups based on management after the diagnosis of acl rupture had been made .    2.572131542297253
group i ( n = 129 ) underwent acl reconstruction using free bone - patellar tendon - bone autografts , while group ii ( n = 92 ) received conservative treatment .    2.4225141515811055
we were able to evaluate 92 patients during follow - up ( 42 from group i and 50 from group ii ) .    2.4897440463767233
the average follow - up period was 86 months .    2.7675496700998354
there were no significant differences between the two groups regarding the patients ' age , sex , or level of sports activity .    2.4556708315398654
follow - up consisted of clinical and radiological examinations and recording of the subjective opinions of the patients .    3.127322562772408
during follow - up , we used ikdc and oak scores to evaluate the results .    2.868830736436591
we found significantly better results in the group that was operated on if the patients took part in high - risk pivoting sports , but there was no difference if the patients were in the low - risk or no - risk pivoting group of athletes .    2.9210887817924522
concerning reoperation and early arthrosis , the difference was significant between the two groups .    2.4601880748147944
background : by depletion of UNK UNK , enhanced levels of uv radiation reach the surface of the earth .    2.7071871978975763
exposure of the anterior parts of the eye to uv radiation leads to irritation of the conjunctival and corneal cells .    2.701397197408221
the aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of a low field strength mri unit ( 0 . 2 t ; UNK , UNK ) and a high field strength mri unit ( 1 . 5 t ; siemens ) in detecting meniscal lesions .    2.7904743254143125
twenty patients were investigated on a 0 . 2 - t low - field mri unit and a 1 . 5 - t high - field mri unit for meniscal lesions .    2.716534635110544
evaluation was performed of four meniscal compartments ( anterior and posterior medial and lateral meniscus ) , for a total of 80 observations .    2.66157060871679
the reliability of diagnosis was UNK qualitatively on a three - point scale .    2.476296683697089
investigations of the high - field mri unit revealed a meniscal tear in 6 patients and ruled out a tear in 14 patients .    2.5660545387161253
evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 58 observations and with moderate confidence in 22 observations .    1.9665595828001234
investigations of the low - field mri unit revealed a meniscal tear in 5 patients and ruled out tears in 15 patients .    2.534316190147933
evaluation of individual meniscal compartments revealed diagnosis with high confidence in 39 observations , with moderate confidence in 38 observations , and with low confidence in 3 observations .    1.9609893181082878
the diagnosis in high - and low - field images was identical in 98 . 7 % of cases ; in one patient observations from the high - field unit changed the therapeutic management .    2.854626731257386
diagnostic reliability was significantly higher with UNK strength mr imaging .    2.6663052142991703
low field strength mr imaging shows comparatively high diagnostic accuracy for meniscal lesions compared to high field strength imaging ; however , we demonstrated a significantly higher confidence in diagnosis with high - field mr imaging .    2.6293638393106638
the past decade has seen the successful application of genetic techniques in the dissection of the most important phenotypes of cancer cells .    2.71943272013975
in the case of drug resistance mechanisms , the elucidation of the genes involved in resistance to anticancer agents has led to new and unexpected information about tumor physiology and may well open therapeutic options by virtue of reversing clinical UNK .    1.958877023316138
the experimental characterization of defined multidrug resistance factors , such as p - glycoprotein , multidrug resistance associated protein , topoisomerase , or glutathione - s - UNK in urologic malignancies , is now relatively comprehensive , allowing for an initial analysis .    1.9844465346127835
clinical studies on some of these concepts have been started and will be the subject of careful UNK .    2.570768971419376
we expect that they will have a considerable impact on the way certain urologic anticancer strategies will be UNK in the future .    2.6852567562400083
a study was carried out to determine the risk of dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar and of the lingual nerve after molar surgery .    3.119307945909565
a total of UNK impacted lower UNK teeth and 3 impacted lower second UNK were removed in 687 patients , all of whom with unaltered sensibility preoperatively .    1.9689838949122629
clinical , radiological , and surgical factors of each case were recorded .    2.78226639142411
postoperative disturbances in the sensibility of the lip and tongue were evaluated by neurological examination .    2.3394920580069627
follow - up was carried out for a maximum of 35 weeks .    3.108827005439248
dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve occurred with an incidence of 3 . 57 % .    2.616769589853518
the lingual nerve was injured in 2 . 1 % of patients .    2.9240369847550096
most of the initially reported alterations in sensation resolved within the follow - up period .    2.3911882672325318
dysesthesia of the inferior alveolar nerve persisted in 0 . 91 % , and of the lingual nerve in 0 . 37 % .    2.656804051315783
however , the extent of the prolonged impairment was slight in general .    2.5529670997344045
the effect of the documented factors on the incidence of dysesthesia was analyzed .    3.1898448428902637
for the inferior alveolar nerve , analysis revealed significant effects in older patients , for completely developed roots , for deeply impacted teeth , in the radiological relationship of the roots and the inferior alveolar canal , for difficult surgery , and for intraoperative exposure of the nerve .    2.3800018336144406
background : this review of radiological and other procedures used in the diagnosis of ( chronic ) low - back pain is not intended to provide a complete evaluation of the methods employed , because the validity , specificity and sensitivity of the various diagnostic measures are the subject of so much controversy that a comprehensive discussion would be beyond the scope of the present overview .    2.7226760023546417
the choice of method depends not only on the clinical symptoms but also on the localisation of the pain , the aetiology of which may also be related to the age of the patient .    3.1000897038511104
UNK and UNK are typical manifestations of yersinia infections in children .    2.777192280818048
this is a report on a child with localised UNK mesenteric UNK due to yersinia UNK persistent for a long time .    2.4905473225065595
we found specific antibodies against yersinia outer membrane proteins repeat - UNK in the patients ' serum .    2.8804143988867326
the present study investigates patients ' expectations toward radiotherapy and their associations to quality of life and physician judgements .    2.3034554906145646
fifty - five patients with tumors of different sites ( 30 with previous tumor - related surgery , 25 without surgery ) admitted to the department of radiotherapy filled out a standardized questionnaire ( eortc qlq - c30 , UNK by UNK et al . , therapy - related expectations and success ) before and after inpatient radiotherapy .    2.2486243512208888
fifty - eight percent of the patients expected the therapeutic goal " healing " , whereas from the physician ' s UNK this was realistic in only 7 % of cases .    2.6100414534025624
the specific radiotherapy - related expectations " tumor control " and " pain relief " reached almost the same levels in patients and physician ( 71 % vs 71 % and 40 % vs 44 % ) .    2.213138159464688
patients with healing expectancy reported higher quality of life at the beginning of the therapy ( 53 . 4 % vs 39 . 9 % ) ; patients UNK pain relief reported lower quality of life ( 37 . 1 % vs 54 . 5 % ) .    2.9482036638577545
surgical patients who had been operated on within the past year ( n = 18 ) showed a particularly high healing expectancy ( 83 % ) , whereas patients whose operation dated back more than 1 year focused on pain relief as therapeutic goal ( 83 % ) .    2.5322687247348807
the surgeon , as the primary contact person for patients , can influence patients ' therapy - related expectations .    2.5182846986817786
in explaining the overall therapeutic strategy , surgeons should also mention the scope and limits of adjuvant therapies .    2.0910269446032506
the meanings of the terms " quality " , " quality of care " , and " quality management " were clarified with common international definitions .    2.2776598398858288
based on that , the basic ideas , concepts , and objectives of quality management in medicine were explained .    2.310268388909598
finally some future trends related to quality were viewed , which represent challenges for the medical profession and entire medicine .    2.0984080331754567
the papular - purpuric " gloves and socks " syndrome ( ppgss ) was first described in 1990 by harms et al .    1.8576754565166185
the syndrome is characterised by fever , an UNK erythema with edema , confluent papules and purpura of the hands and feet in a " gloves and socks " distribution .    2.2306018974724373
the skin lesions may be associated with purpura and superficial erosions of the oral mucosa .    2.9641737799961607
viral infections , in particular parvovirus b19 , are the most likely trigger .    3.093998949870191
in the present case ppgss developed after taking trimethoprim / UNK .    2.244309177423159
since the patient developed identical symptoms after accidental re - challenge with the same drug , this case strongly suggests medications as another factor in the pathogenesis of ppgss .    2.3436094779278824
most fractures of the clavicle heal well with nonoperative treatment .    3.0081143908250763
on rare occasions , malunited clavicular fractures are associated with a pattern of disability that includes not only pain but also functional or neurovascular impairment .    2.116678917295959
in these cases , clavicular osteotomy and correction of the deformity should be considered .    2.554921087089469
in four patients with a malunited fracture of the clavicle following nonoperative treatment , we performed a clavicular osteotomy for deformity .    2.8906178677802625
in all four patients the clavicular fracture healed with shortening associated with pain and ipsilateral glenohumeral dysfunction .    2.114421240641317
the deformity was not associated with neurovascular dysfunction .    2.472824871673926
in preoperative x - ray studies , the shortening of the malunited clavicle was between 0 . 9 and 2 . 2 cm in comparison to the contralateral clavicle .    3.2590285919908095
all patients underwent an extension osteotomy of the clavicle with interposition of an autogenous iliac crest bone graft .    2.3369905523407715
the follow - up was 1 - 4 years postoperatively .    3.0094673376748022
the functional outcome was evaluated using the constant - murley and the UNK score .    2.8986723720270207
all patients had immediate pain relief following osteotomy and correction of the deformity .    2.4951249211453095
the shoulder function rapidly improved , and the functional outcome was good in three out of the four patients .    3.1470633249629327
if there is associated functional impairment in malunited clavicular fractures , extension osteotomy combined with autogenous bone grafting may produce predictably good results .    1.927264870468627
as the importance of laparoscopic surgery for benign diseases of the gastrointestinal tract continues to grow , the application of this approach in cases of malignancy remains controversial .    3.0539962327755834
although the concept of cancer recurrence in the area of surgical wounds is not new , the incidence of port site recurrence is the most obvious concern .    2.946442804508521
indications and contraindications for surgery as well as a standardized nomenclature describing the type of laparoscopic procedures being performed are some other issues that need to be clarified .    2.479533893267562
complete laparoscopic procedures or the combination of laparoscopy with open techniques can offer advantages and disadvantages that surgeons will have to take into consideration when making decisions .    2.281809525086415
the skill of the operating team and the extent of disease define the boundaries of laparoscopic surgery possible .    2.5248482565284474
the continued research as well as development of intelligent instruments and standardized techniques might give laparoscopy a clear role in the treatment of abdominal malignancies .    2.7302413922590314
background : the mechanical stabilization of the cornea in keratoconus may delay progression of this disease .    2.307038600909458
the cross - linking techniques optimized in UNK of enucleated porcine eyes were investigated under in vivo conditions in rabbits to estimate the biocompatibility and duration of the stiffening effect .    2.241520927218533
in the biopsy material of a polypoid intrabronchial lesion of a 54 - year - old male patient with radiologically established lung tumor , spindle - cell neoplasia was seen .    2.087414992708616
no clear histogenetic classification of the submucous tumor process was possible .    2.452302883401026
after resection of the right upper lobe of the lung , including the results of additional immunohistochemical analyses , the tumor was classified as biphasic synovial sarcoma .    3.1294534440204003
this was suggested mostly by immunohistochemical detection of the epithelial membrane UNK ( ema ) and of vimentin .    2.431125343770783
extensive clinical examinations ruled out the possibility of a primary tumor with UNK localization .    2.717501883833743
this case report shows the problems faced in correctly classifying the histogenesis or the direction of differentiation in extremely rare cases of primary pulmonary synovial sarcoma .    2.167069402993912
necrotizing pancreatitis is still associated with considerable morbidity and mortality .    2.5377199730587505
formerly , surgical treatment with early and extensive pancreatic resection has been the standard .    2.8567775358088494
improvements in our understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease and progress in the field of intensive care therapy have made conservative therapy the initial standard in the treatment of necrotizing pancreatitis .    3.3115476735198874
a considerable percentage of patients with sterile necrosis can be managed with low morbidity and mortality by conservative treatment without operation .    3.0569446345296023
nevertheless , surgical treatment is indicated in patients with infected necrosis and in sterile necrosis if multiorgan failure persists over a limited period of time despite maximum intensive care therapy .    2.540100682083016
pancreatic resection should be abandoned for surgical treatment of pancreatic necrosis , as results with regard to morbidity , mortality and long - term outcome are unsatisfactory .    2.933592161671989
in experienced hands , all three procedures provide similar results with regard to morbidity and mortality .    2.537412798406533
the aim of quality management in rheumatology is to improve care and outcome in patients with rheumatic diseases .    2.743127844344275
this can be achieved by means of prospective long - term observation of the patient with regular documentation of clinical , radiological , biochemical and functional data using certain validated scoring methods ( das , radiological score , adl score UNK or health assessment questionnaire , UNK , etc . ) .    2.4586475045843508
long - term observation and documentation including radiographs have been performed in the rheumatology hospital in ratingen for 20 years without even knowing the term quality management .    2.1891933264668553
the hospital staff should closely cooperate with the doctors in private practice who UNK patients and should continously support patient organizations .    2.169199385616104
the quality of outcome is influenced by the process quality which depends on the following factors : selection , training and motivation of the hospital staff ; supervision of clinical assessment and documentation by senior physicians , daily x - ray demonstrations and case reports , interdisciplinary case demonstrations at least every week in addition to daily consultation , team reports , regular education including review of actual literature for physicians , education programs exchanging knowledge with physiotherapists and nurses , and regular education programs for patients .    2.1261804909875273
process quality can only be achieved by an interdisciplinary approach and regular communication between all participants including the patient , whose opinion must be noted and regarded .    2.5030114821285623
as far as possible , the same doctor who UNK the patient in the hospital should follow her / him in the outpatient clinic .    2.6240971560821214
the quality of outcome can be improved by regular UNK of the patient with control of medication , side effects , efficacy , documentation of clinical , biochemical , radiological , and functional data .    2.906940530339255
decisions for further treatment have to be based on these follow - up data .    3.83786301851171
a standardized follow up and documentation system for all rheumatology units with prompt feedback could definitely improve the quality of rheumatologic care in germany .    2.1714880104410903
two children on chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia ( UNK ) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) had initially focal , then generalized seizures of short duration .    2.131839706107629
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealed in one case minor parietal , cortical and subcortical increased signal on t2 - weighted images .    2.1187411032452355
in a second case extended supratentorial lesions and additional signal changes in the cerebellum were found .    2.378708788627099
although chemotherapy was continued , a few days later signal changes were considerably reduced or had disappeared .    2.243003968187421
we consider these lesions to be seizure induced in a brain previously sensitized by chemotherapy .    2.105529898188381
hydatid disease is caused by the parasitic UNK echinococcus .    2.9602396710724936
the larval stage of this parasite can thrive in many parts of the body , most frequently in the liver .    2.451349732667996
primary bone location is very rare , accounting for less than 2 % of all hydatid lesions .    3.0927442492014783
we report on a case of left - sided extended pelvic infestation .    2.5710996215901263
the destruction of the hip joint , os pubis , large parts of the ileum and the femoral head made pelvic resection and prosthetic replacement necessary .    2.5616283798521553
recurrence of a hydatid cyst 5 years later in the left groin originating from the proximal femur was treated with second femoral resection and new total hip replacement .    2.4791953007883225
because of instability , the primarily inserted UNK pelvic replacement had to be exchanged for a custom - made device fabricated with the aid of computer - aided design ( cad ) techniques .    2.099362650517911
this surgical procedure was combined with chemotherapy ( UNK ) .    3.0248170019145006
despite their positive inotropic and UNK effects , these drugs are still under discussion because of certain adverse effects like UNK , elevation of UNK , abdominal UNK , and excessive periphereal vasodilatation .    2.5247250639836203
as a consequence , more UNK phosphodiesterase inhibitors were developed with the aim of reducing these adverse effects .    2.361516723055078
one of them , enoximone ( UNK UNK UNK , fig .    3.2004985603168747
1 ) , an UNK derivative , has nearly no influence on platelets and abdominal organ function .    2.6065497587889674
in addition , in many studies vasodilatation was found to be absent .    2.6724114374760277
recently a new substance , r80122 ( UNK , UNK , fig .    3.040313401966055
1 ) , was developed .    3.4550919112224086
first experimental studies showed high UNK of this substance .    2.7881040072596104
the aim of this study was to compare the haemodynamic effects of enoximone and r80122 in patients with ischaemic heart disease .    2.257540223612559
the extremely rare finding of a proximal radio - ulnar synostosis in a 5 years - old girl with a fetal alcohol syndrome is presented .    2.263590851169279
despite the elbow ' s being fixed at 30 ° pronation , the patient exhibits good ipsilateral arm function .    2.1626010093858317
the difficulties in differential diagnosis and treatment modalities are discussed .    2.887055848782878
ischemic preconditioning ( ip ) , using one or more brief periods of ischemia before a sustained UNK - mia , represents a new approach in reducing ischemia - induced skeletal muscle damage .    2.0567436102786205
the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ip on skeletal muscle function after 3 h ischemia and 2 h reperfusion in a UNK model .    2.427203391038668
ip protocols using one , two , or three preconditioning cycles of 10 min ischemia and 10 min reperfusion each , were compared to non - UNK controls .    2.3710964465509257
ip was found to significantly improve force , performance , endurance , and contractility of postischemic skeletal muscle .    2.3104487738809243
the efficacy of ip - induced protection was correlated with the number of preconditioning cycles .    2.76480766418858
preconditioning with three cycles resulted in a more effective protection as compared to one or two cycles .    3.077753399724477
altogether , this study describes the efficacy of ip in improving post - ischemic muscle function and the need of more than one ip cycle to achieve this improvement .    2.6183726623521437
the respective clinical potential warrants further exploration .    2.3631857680593873
pachyonychia congenita ( pc ) is a rare ectodermal dysplasia with variable expression .    2.753333403054571
the condition is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait .    2.5823838065552063
several classifications of pc have been proposed .    2.694200638097049
UNK and colleagues suggested four clinical types of pc .    2.240864093539769
type ii , the jackson - lawler - syndrome , is characterized by multiple epidermal cysts , palmoplantar bullae and hyperhidrosis as well as natal teeth in addition to the main findings of pachyonychia , palmoplantar hyperkeratosis and follicular keratosis .    2.444722656434505
we report two patients ( father and son ) with jackson - lawler - syndrome and describe in detail pathogenesis , diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches as well as the different classifications of pachyonychia congenita .    2.276990124075514
aim of this review article was to critically analyse the recently described UNK and molecular markers for testicular germ cell tumors with regard to their clinical utility .    2.6247443969050894
the UNK i ( 12p ) represents the most common and characteristic cytogenetic finding which already appears in testicular carcinoma in situ .    2.216081620599828
a number of proto - oncogenes ( cyclin d and UNK ) as well as putative tumor suppressor genes are localized on 12p ; however , their role in pathogenesis and prognosis of testicular germ cell tumors has not been defined yet .    2.713754868749152
clinical characteristics of patients with familial testicular germ cell tumors indicate a genetic background for the development of testicular tumors .    3.063684420858775
although a number of UNK loci encoding potential testicular tumor susceptibility genes have been identified , the genetic basis of testicular cancer pathogenesis is still unknown .    2.420809746943576
with regard to molecular prognostic risk factors most of the reported data on proliferation markers , tumor suppressor genes , proteases and adhesion molecules have to be confirmed in prospective randomized trials prior to their widespread clinical use .    2.435358849268377
based on the available data on prospective studies percentage of embryonal carcinoma and vascular invasion appear to be the most significant prognosticators .    2.7079277295086386
after laparoscopic cholecystectomy , carbon dioxide ( co2 ) must be exhaled after resorption from the abdominal cavity .    2.2510169573128436
there is controversy about the amount and relevance of postoperative co2 resorption .    2.353435469369757
without continuous postoperative monitoring , after laparoscopic cholecystectomy a certain risk may consist in unnoticed hypercapnia due to co2 resorption .    2.034289896539421
studies exist on the course of end - expiratory co2 ( peco2 ) alone over a longer postoperative period of time in extubated patients during spontaneous breathing .    2.4204036079804077
the goal of this prospective study was to investigate the amount of co2 resorbed from the abdominal cavity in the postoperative period by means of co2 metabolism .    2.8578213915843125
after giving informed consent to the study , which was approved by the local ethics committee , 20 patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy .    2.8400368000187863
all patients received general endotracheal anaesthesia .    2.489664623352144
after induction , total iv anaesthesia was maintained using fentanyl , propofol , and atracurium .    2.178969771298088
patients were ventilated with oxygen in air ( fio2 0 . 4 ) .    2.539741351099061
the intraabdominal pressure during the surgical procedure ranged from 12 to 14 mm hg .    2.402129682381026
thirty minutes after releasing the UNK ( kp ) , co2 elimination ( v . co2 ) , oxygen uptake ( v . o2 ) , and respiratory quotient ( rq ) were measured every minute for 1 h by indirect calorimetry using the metabolic monitor UNK according to the principle of UNK .    2.3999989722180923
assuming an unchanged metabolism , the co2 resorption ( v . co2 ) at any given time ( t ) can be calculated from v . co2 ( t ) = v . co2 ( t ) - rq ( preop ) v . o2 ( t ) .    2.275952108523488
the first data were collected before surgery and after introduction of the arterial and venous cannulae for a 15 - min period .    2.6106928182836886
measuring point 0 was determined after UNK of the kp and emptying of the remaining co2 via manual compression by the surgeon at the end of surgery .    2.646404701069513
patient ' s UNK were extubated and metabolic monitoring started 30 min after release of the kp for 60 min .    2.611926410752705
simultaneously , a nasal side - stream capnometry probe was placed and the peco2 and respiratory frequency ( rf ) were obtained by the UNK UNK ( datex ) and registered every minute as well .    2.320565160312792
values were averaged over four periods of 15 min each .    2.3316470488674166
an arterial blood gas sample was drawn at the end of every 15 - min period .    2.5684817758583787
postoperative pain was scored by a visual analog scale and completed by a subjective index questionnaire on general well - being .    2.166595877310147
all data were analysed by the UNK or wilcoxon test ; p < 0 . 05 was considered significant .    2.6377808820049045
the findings do not indicate co2 resorption in the postoperative period after laparoscopic cholecystectomy ( tables 2 and 3 , fig .    2.427397573553683
arterial co2 as well as peco2 were elevated postoperatively ( 45 mm hg vs . 36 mm hg intraoperatively ) , while v . co2 and v . o2 were unchanged when compared to the preoperative measuring period .    2.4667315745530387
the postoperative rf was comparable to preoperative values .    2.556454289267297
calculated co2 was lower than 10 ml / min and within accuracy of measurements .    2.8882923232258975
the postoperative pain index ranged between 3 and 4 , and 3 . 75 - 15 mg piritramid was administered .    2.4964599381341386
all patients UNK UNK immediately after the operation , but scores improved slightly at the end of the 60 - min period of metabolic monitoring .    2.595358492446326
there is no significant resorption of co2 from the abdominal cavity later than 30 min after releasing the kp .    2.272663876173217
up to this time , any co2 remaining in the abdominal cavity after careful emptying by the surgeon has been resorbed and exhaled .    2.1527361615449
the gene of the cyclin - dependent kinase 4 ( UNK ) - inhibitor p16ink4a ( UNK / UNK ) has been proposed as a candidate for a tumor - suppressor gene located on chromosome 9p21 , a frequently deleted region in a series of human cancers including malignant melanoma .    2.300802163181757
an increasing and sometimes conflicting body of data has accumulated regarding the frequency of homozygous UNK and mutations as well as the importance of p16ink4a in malignant melanoma .    2.5807512673107915
the purpose of this review is therefore to summarize the current knowledge on p16ink4a and to discuss its biologic significance in the pathogenesis of melanocytic tumors .    2.362440840467986
the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in hiv - infected patients is high .    2.6153727257792916
the differential diagnosis includes UNK disorders , acute psychiatric symptoms of an hiv - associated encephalopathy , and symptomatic psychotic illnesses due to secondary neurologic manifestations such as opportunistic central nervous infections and intracerebral lymphoma .    2.0299850193556974
clinical aspects and psychopathological findings are not sufficient for differential diagnosis and identification of primarily psychiatric disorders .    2.5946739436961774
secondary neurologic manifestations causing a symptomatic psychosis must be excluded as soon as possible by brain imaging ( ct , mri ) and analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid .    2.6657896550941462
in emergency situations , however , german law imposes strict regulations , especially in the case of UNK patients .    3.150242186143865
these medical and medicolegal questions are illustrated by case reports and UNK for an effective strategy are made .    2.2977655308023794
in simultaneous bilateral nerve recordings , patients with sympathetically maintained pain ( smp ) affecting one limb show similar sympathetic traffic in nerves supplying the affected and unaffected limb , also when the painful limb shows a marked regional autonomic ( vasomotor ) dysfunction .    1.799541132978338
these findings argue against the notion that smp must be mediated by a reflex change in the pattern of sympathetic discharge .    2.220093118337225
in general , they underline the fact that autonomic effector disturbances may give little information about underlying nerve traffic .    2.1483481348376903
intraoperative transluminal angioplasty ( ita ) has considerably broadened the spectrum of vascular surgical reconstruction , UNK the requirements of minimally invasive therapy and has thus experienced a rapid development within the past few years .    2.301677403250078
whereas the indications and clinical results have been described adequately in the literature , reports on the procedural management of ita are rare .    2.83413873665366
one of the basic prerequisites of this method is the correct and UNK implantation of the vascular access sheath at the proper location .    2.7708084014727774
in the following , the technique of UNK - and retrograde sheath implantation , either through the vessel itself or through a vascular graft , is described in detail .    2.433035209484404
by UNK particular standards for sheath introduction , ischaemia time and vessel wall injury during ita can be kept to a minimum .    1.9230901276976233
the importance of the UNK of vascular reconstruction to angioplasty is also elucidated .    3.21646233669401
in addition , the advantages and disadvantages of sheath implantation compared with direct vessel puncture are demonstrated .    2.1352299825219587
in spite of new developments , including intraluminal fixation of the sheath with an expandable balloon , the " ideal " angioplasty access sheath is , as yet , not available .    2.1819777271800693
in several cases of lupus erythematosus ( sle , UNK , dle ) , the koebner phenomenon could be seen in the apparently normal skin of patients following traumas , scratching effects , operation scars , contact dermatitis , pressure from UNK UNK , application of liquid nitrogen , exposure to strong sun light , etc .    2.489490098672878
the interval between exposure to such provocation factors and appearance of the isomorphic reactions varied from case to case .    2.1232756363034544
in sle patients receiving systemic treatment with glucocorticosteroids , the koebner phenomenon could not be found , while it was detected in patients with generalized dle who had never received any systemic glucocorticoid hormones .    2.623027510130329
it was not seen in patients with localized dle .    3.39739264439069
there was no direct relationship between the appearance of humoral autoantibodies and onset of the koebner phenomenon .    2.60993328274002
with regard to the UNK of the koebner phenomenon , it is thought that disturbances of the local cellular repair processes and of the cytokine network , with expression of adhesion molecules , might be involved .    2.9864187860636315
the koebner phenomenon may be a valuable model for the investigation of lupus erythematosus .    2.9971335691540375
in 5 years 9 patients with a total of 16 painful ear nodules ( UNK UNK ) have been treated as follows .    3.093490614921326
a small excision is carried out with local anaesthesia for histological examination .    2.607386285999021
the rest of the nodule or any other nodules are UNK by means of the argon laser , also with local anaesthesia , including the surface of the cartilage under the nodules .    2.53212190467312
there have been no cases of postoperative inflammation or infection .    2.261392380489567
new nodules occurring several months after treatment have been successfully treated in the same way .    2.859014599042783
there have been no real recurrences .    2.46270188390057
the cosmetic result is very good in all cases .    2.555761110282884
the patients are free of pain immediately after the laser therapy .    2.7817398463178296
we represent and discuss etiology , diagnosis as well as differential diagnoses of tuberculous UNK referring to an actual case of this rare disease .    2.4446849395180132
in the least of all cases one can conclude from the clinical symptoms on the tuberculous origin of the disease .    2.665554231943997
other differential diagnoses will set more frequently due to rarity of this disease .    2.3577695545656434
quite a lot of cases a bacterial superinfection UNK the sterile UNK as main characteristic of genitourinary tuberculosis .    2.214383337405947
as before the evidence of mycobacteria tuberculosis is the most important parameter to proof a tuberculosis .    2.7475406881643876
despite required microbiological cultivation to make a UNK the polymerase chain reaction is a high sensitive and comparable fast method for detection of mycobacteria even from tissue .    2.286532070243951
in such UNK cases we recommend to perform an operative denudation due to frequently difficult delimitation from malignant testicular tumours .    2.0245192366906974
in surgical procedures associated with high blood loss , such as vascular and cardiac operations , differential diagnosis and therapy of perioperative hemorrhage are of special importance .    2.86781237144381
preoperative screening for patients at high risk of bleeding and in particular for those with qualitative platelet disorders [ drug - induced platelet disorders ( in particular UNK ) , von willebrand ' s disease and other congenital platelet disorders ] is effective in minimizing blood loss .    2.640785938414281
bleeding in acute medical emergencies or during emergency operations may require treatment without specific investigations being performed in advance .    2.0066785745936624
therefore , simple schemes are essential for the rapid management of acute hemostatic problems .    2.488500359104661
the aim of this paper was to address the diagnostic and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis focusing mainly on diagnosis and therapy of hemorrhagic diathesis due to blood platelet disorders and blood coagulation disorders and preoperative identification of patients at increased risk of bleeding .    2.3746014314305723
although deep vein thrombosis now has a better prognosis than in the era before anticoagulation , a number of patients remain in whom UNK UNK cannot be adequately controlled by conservative treatment .    2.6439048414571817
the case report of a 50 - year - old woman with stage iii chronic venous insufficiency associated with the post - thrombotic syndrome is presented .    2.6842082250159067
progress in imaging techniques and functional diagnostics of the post - thrombotic syndrome make a reliable differentiation of the chronic venous insufficiency possible with respect to obstruction or reflux .    2.613316986434369
if conservative treatment fails , UNK valve transplantation is described as a suitable reconstructive management method in the treatment of reflux .    2.558815969112136
following this report , the results and limitations of this method are discussed .    3.4024474605461053
their persistence during full clinical remission , however , is associated with an increased risk for relapse and , thus may represent trait markers for affective disorders .    2.597660659563557
in order to test this hypothesis , we designed a prospective study in which healthy first - degree relatives ( high - risk probands ; hrps ; n = 54 ) of patients with an affective disorder are investigated by means of polysomnography , the combined dexamethasone and UNK - releasing hormone ( dex - crh ) test and a variety of psychometric scales .    2.4974966761529735
in the present part of the study ( index assessment ) , these hrps , as a group , showed depressionlike alterations in both the sleep pattern and the dex - crh - test outcome ; furthermore , their psychometric profile was characterized by elevated scores on the scales assessing " rigidity " and " autonomic UNK " .    2.1552468931556623
on a single - case level , 35 % of the hrps were identified as conspicuous ( depressionlike ) in at least two of the three areas investigated .    2.685772860743683
a decision of whether or not this " UNK " indeed represents a trait marker for affective disorders can be reached when the follow - up part of the study has identified those hrps with their respective UNK status who have developed an affective disorder in the meantime .    2.501954266209924
undifferentiated connective tissue disease with secondary UNK syndrome was diagnosed in a 33 year old woman after recurrent arterial thromboses , two miscarriages and myocarditis .    2.242974853632027
despite effective immunosuppression and anticoagulation her initially mild UNK pulmonary hypertension progressed in the absence of thromboembolic events , cardiopulmonary disease or other systemic disorders .    2.118487610260334
UNK in a dosage of up to 4 . 5 ng / kg / min for a total of 15 months , her 6 min walking - distance improved from 210 to 315 m , the pulmonary vascular resistance decreased from UNK to UNK UNK - 5 and the mean pulmonary arterial pressure decreased from 64 to 54 mmhg .    2.6501377441211993
this partial success of conservative treatment enabled a UNK of the necessity for heart and lung transplantation .    2.999491626512389
in the usa , recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) has been approved for therapy of acute ischemic stroke ( ais ) within a 3 hour time window based on the results of the ninds [ 1 ] trial .    2.5861903622122617
only few patients with ais are referred to a hospital within three hours after onset of symptoms , and only 3 % of these patients qualify for treatment with rt - pa .    2.7456282881632963
therefore , only few patients with ais will potentially benefit from therapy with rt - pa if ninds criteria are applied .    2.1791493895094662
the goal of the second european - UNK acute stroke study ( ecass ii ) was to evaluate safety and efficacy of thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa in ais for a 6 hour time window .    2.262311823311628
objective : to prove the response and side effects of UNK in early and late onset juvenile UNK , also the therapeutic effect dependent on the marker hla b27 .    2.853530719460554
the radiologic imaging methods play an important role in the precise staging as basic requirement for an effective concept of tumor therapy .    2.277733428838014
the accuracy of ultrasound in the primary staging according to the tnm - classification ( uicc ) was therefore prospectively investigated in 260 patients with head and neck tumors of the clinical stages UNK to UNK .    2.834052106489676
the clinically ( c1 ) and sonographically ( c2 ) evaluated pretherapeutic stages were compared to the postoperative histopathologic tumor classifications .    2.263351710510599
the clinical staging was correct in 75 . 0 % , high in 7 . 7 % , low in 17 . 3 % , the n - stages were correct in 59 . 2 % , high in 17 . 7 % , low in 23 . 1 % .    2.964160696359284
the sonographic staging was apparently superior with the t - classifications correct in 92 . 3 % , high in 7 . 7 % , low 0 . 0 % .    2.5959879073544476
the n - stages were correct in 89 . 6 % , high in 9 . 2 % , low in 1 . 2 % .    3.1650115261373104
the accuracy of combined UNK classification rose from clinical 46 . 5 % to 84 . 6 % by sonography .    2.741568840218523
therefore , the thorough sonographic investigation performed after the clinical examination and before invasive procedures , due to little patient discomfort , good availability and high accuracy , is an excellent sectional imaging method for staging , therapy - planning and follow up of tumors of the head and neck especially of the orofacial regions .    2.4325116080588174
standardized guidelines for exercise training for patients with chronic congestive heart failure ( chf ) have not been established .    2.9874128595409086
in the past chf patients involved in exercise training studies demonstrated a wide range of cardiac and functional impairment , with an ejection fraction between 18 and 35 % and a peak vo2 between 12 . 2 and 25 . 4 ml / kg / min on average .    2.4415369873540795
for determination of training intensity , a vo2 between 40 and 70 % of peak vo2 and / or training heart rate between 60 and 80 % of peak heart rate was used .    2.572722310180029
there was also a wide range for frequency ( between 3 and 7 times per week ) and duration of training ( between 20 and 60 min per session ) .    2.3869328087123383
for aerobic exercise training only continuous training methods were applied .    2.2826741329292637
we have developed a new interval training method which allows intense exercise stimuli on peripheral muscles with minimal cardiac strain .    1.9863594236491455
after only three weeks of training , the improvement in aerobic capacity was similar to that reported after longer training periods using continuous methods .    2.1452574960778206
to determine work rate for work phases of interval training , a special steep UNK test was developed .    2.1478298040852213
by analysis of acute physical responses to this testing procedure and to the interval training , both were proven to be UNK in chf patients , even if their ejection fraction is as low as 13 % , or peak cardiac index not greater than 1 . 6 l / m2 / min , and peak vo2 less than 8 . 5 ml / kg / min .    2.505396019190262
therapeutic choice in laryngeal carcinoma is influenced by the nature of the tumor and a variety of factors involving the patient and physician .    3.02867121440855
small ( t1 ) and exophytic ( t1 , t2 ) tumors are suitable for radiotherapy .    2.323542360866646
limited lesions ( t1 , t2 ) can be cured by functional endoscopic resection techniques or external partial laryngectomies .    2.253538403292864
extensive tumors ( large t2 ; t3 ) are treated by total laryngectomy or by primary irradiation , especially in the case of a good response to induction chemotherapy .    2.5132279103707518
when radiation treatment fails , surgery UNK in more than half of the cases .    2.7547742052049773
tumors infiltrating or UNK the laryngeal framework ( t4 ) can only be cured by total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy .    2.2559373306550685
subtotal or circular ablation of the adjacent pharynx or esophagectomy needs repair with visceral or myocutaneous grafts .    2.079209714118517
lymphatics are preferentially treated with the same modality as used in the primary disease .    3.2044702946780386
inconspicuous lymphatics should be treated electively in most cases , with the exception of early glottic cancer .    2.9474483979793353
induced hypotension is defined as a reduction in mean arterial blood pressure to 50 - 60 mm hg in normotensive subjects .    2.9154985565785734
the aim of induced hypotension is to decrease intraoperative blood loss , decrease the need for blood transfusions and improve operating conditions .    2.4959416296605554
most studies indicate that induced hypotension can decrease intraoperative blood loss by 50 % in many surgical procedures ; however , some studies report that blood loss is not significantly reduced .    2.34292660844022
current methods of induced hypotension are based on the use of rapid and short - acting vasodilators as primary agents ( UNK , nitroglycerine , UNK ) , supplemented by volatile anesthetics ( isoflurane ) and / or - blockers ( UNK ) to improve effect , reduce dosage and prevent side effects ( reflex tachycardia , UNK , rebound hypertension ) .    2.9379749567450766
proper positioning of the patient and controlled ventilation aid in reducing blood loss .    3.0126011304013716
major risks of induced hypotension are a reduction in blood flow ( i . e .    2.912993380800817
ischaemia ) of vital organs ( brain , myocardium ) and elevation of intracranial pressure in neurosurgical patients .    2.3132956923267467
thus , major contraindications of induced hypotension are severe coronary artery disease , hypertension combined with arteriosclerosis of cerebral vessels and increased intracranial pressure in patients with cerebral disease .    2.5307616013216316
complications are rare in otherwise healthy patients , but may be higher in elderly patients and those with underlying organ dysfunction .    3.0391384040403286
therefore , careful assessment and selection of patients , together with consideration of the potential complications , appropriate choice of drugs and invasive UNK - beat monitoring , are essential for the safe practice of induced hypotension .    2.5851225639296613
abstract empirical results stemming from infant research have contributed extensively to the understanding of coping with psychosocial stress and vulnerability for psychosomatic symptoms in later life .    1.986706985179049
the interaction and the emotional exchange between caregiver and child in the first months of life lead to UNK of interactions that will be the base for the quality of attachment .    2.5138889193191516
the mutual regulation of the caregiver - infant - pair enables the child to acquire a psychic capacity to regulate physiological requirements .    2.0109283097224053
this UNK function determines the potential of the later adult to react to distress - in a symbolic way using words or more in a somatic way by developing psychosomatic symptoms .    1.9575876690243712
first experiences with the treatment of psychosomatic patients with respect to the new findings about self - regulation are reported .    2.945481765843819
a 31 - year - old pregnant woman had to undergo emergency abdominal surgery due to acute intestinal obstruction .    2.4526092156212385
the patient ' s preoperative history demonstrated multiple allergies as well as abdominal trauma several years before .    2.631064695422866
the physical examination - including sonography of the two fetuses - showed no pathological signs .    2.5674720918995404
anaesthesia was induced intravenously with the operating table tilted to the left side , using routine precautions pre - oxygenation , and rapid sequence intubation , and was maintained UNK .    2.2693535621785355
about 20 min after the onset of surgery , hypotension , tachycardia , and a drop in oxygen saturation appeared .    3.127052387204498
volume substitution and the application of vasoactive drugs failed to stabilise the haemodynamic situation .    2.45735025784714
elevation of the pregnant uterus and increased left UNK of the operating table did not lead to improvement .    3.001280947309963
the development of eyelid edema led to the diagnosis of an anaphylactic reaction .    3.1332092719162206
the patient was treated successfully with epinephrine , antihistamines , and corticosteroids ( prednisolone ) .    2.194661315608788
the suspicion of latex - related allergy was verified postoperatively by radio - allergen - UNK test ( rast ) and prick and scratch tests .    1.955999288306111
the mean arterial blood pressure is decreased during the first two UNK of pregnancy and increases to preconceptional values during the last weeks of gestation .    2.6624045438542567
the heart rate increases during the whole course of pregnancy .    2.5645633483839854
during late gestation fewer patients show an increase in diastolic blood pressure and heart rate in the standing position .    2.6472978825477953
a fall in heart rate was only seen in this period .    2.9060195465957808
a fall in mean arterial blood pressure during standing is not related to the blood pressure in the supine position during the whole course of pregnancy .    2.5571584298762864
the UNK symptoms are twice as frequent during early pregnancy compared to late pregnancy .    2.176649617090789
headaches , fatigue and cold extremities are the most usual complaints .    2.5166820716248863
the frequency and intensity of these three symptoms decrease during gestation .    2.53639394656195
blood pressure in the supine position is reduced in symptomatic pregnant women .    2.423143821057631
however , the occurrence of these symptoms is not correlated to the fall in blood pressure in the standing position .    2.6694712772753477
the birth - weight is not influenced by blood pressure in the supine position , but depends on the fall in blood pressure during standing .    2.47223357861296
pregnant women with a more pronounced fall in blood pressure give birth to newborns with a lower birthweight .    2.371547122404653
these results imply a hitherto unknown cause of intrauterine growth restriction .    2.2254410998721976
the combination of UNK baths and subsequent ultraviolet irradiation is an effective treatment for psoriasis and atopic dermatitis .    2.389650092582937
the aim of the present study was to determine the photosensitizing properties of two commercially available bath salts , original salt from the dead sea and sodium chloride .    1.9337475819378995
the salt concentrations tested were 1 % , 3 % 5 % and 15 % .    2.8765013407162545
tap water followed by uvb and uvb alone served as controls .    2.113073349746366
erythema was determined by visual and UNK measurement , and delayed tanning was assessed by UNK .    2.532102724192781
erythema obtained by wetting the skin prior to uvb irradiation was more pronounced than erythema induced by uvb alone .    2.0836393573231144
the salts had a differing photosensitizing capacity and the strongest erythema was produced by the 5 % solutions .    2.109387763399233
there was only a moderate influence on delayed tanning by bathing the skin prior to irradiation .    2.0486852667058555
the results from the present study indicate that UNK the skin with salt solutions or tap water increases skin sensitivity to subsequent uvb irradiation .    2.4984062125328372
this may contribute to the effectiveness of salt water baths followed by uv irradiation and may account for an increased UNK risk after bathing .    2.5097108151290715
introduction : the aim of the study was to evaluate the modern principles of surgery in diverticulitis , e . g . early elective resection and primary anastomosis .    2.4860104261743943
methods : the data of 445 consecutive patients were retrospectively analysed after classifying all cases in four subgroups according to a modified hinchey classification ( stages 0 - iii ) .    2.0566955082375635
results : within our study group the morbidity was 26 . 5 % ( n = 118 ) and the mortality was 1 . 6 % ( n = 7 ) .    3.630669087919845
in 96 % ( n = 425 ) of all cases and in 64 % ( 21 / 33 ) of patients with perforated diverticulitis and peritonitis ( stage iii ) , a primary anastomosis was performed .    3.005702216125819
four patients of the study group showed insufficient anastomosis ( 0 . 9 % ) .    3.4962796787770727
stage of inflammation and age of patient correlate with morbidity and mortality .    2.5331988094042237
some 53 % ( 94 / 177 ) of the patients in stage ii and 67 % ( 22 / 33 ) of the patients in stage iii had never showed symptoms of diverticulitis before .    2.6989937082275692
conclusion : prophylactic surgery to avoid life - threatening situations , including abscess formation or perforation , is not possible in many cases .    2.4876920562747182
to evaluate whether mri is usefull in staging renal cell carcinomas with caval thrombus the accuracy of computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in staging renal tumors with caval thrombus were preoperatively examined .    2.1348091027289002
tumor staging by ct and mr imaging were correlated with histopathological tumor stadium .    2.5383822223416415
in mri 4 out of 7 thrombi were correctly diagnosed with high accuracy , in ct none .    2.2589964733258494
in advanced renal carcinoma mri with gadolinium was superior to ct imaging , especially in diagnosing tumor thrombus .    2.3755761388513847
consequently the extent of tumor thrombus may be assessed by mri which therefore may replace conventional cavography .    2.421185345571418
children of mothers chronically infected with hepatitis - c - virus ( hcv ) during pregnancy and delivery were prospectively followed .    2.2591723409927855
90 children born to 85 infected mothers were included in our study ; nine of the mothers were known to be co - infected with hiv - 1 .    2.61746643130809
three of the 90 children became infected UNK with hcv as shown by persistence of antibodies after 2 years of life and a positive result in the rt - pcr .    2.5338160003216395
one of these 3 children has evidence of ongoing hepatitis as shown by slightly elevated UNK UNK values , but is otherwise clinically well , likewise the other 2 infected children .    2.0387644728605
54 of the 87 uninfected children were followed until they lost maternal antibodies after an average of one year .    2.2474421545024055
cor triatriatum dexter is a rare congenital malformation in which a membrane UNK the right atrium into two chambers .    2.8281555928174367
the membrane represents a persistence of the right sinus UNK valve ( rsv ) .    2.6138455485844676
normally the rsv UNK between the UNK and UNK week of gestation , as the UNK portion forms the crista UNK and the caudal portion develops into the eustachian and UNK valve .    2.8588254292221604
any failure in the regression process may result in remnants of rsv as a simple muscle bar , a chiari - network or a UNK or UNK membrane ( cor triatriatum dexter ) .    2.204108643206443
we describe a patient with cor triatriatum dexter in whom diagnosis was made several years after successful UNK procedure for severe congenital valvular pulmonary stenosis .    2.1914493151785472
apoptosis and proliferation are important regulators of normal development and homeostasis in the bone marrow .    2.43015789172172
therefore , dynamics of hematopoiesis is mainly defined by these two parameters .    2.221262314515126
however , since only few data are available from previous studies , we performed a retrospective analysis to elucidate some aspects of this complex pathomechanism .    2.8204118307146895
a total of 400 patients with chronic myeloproliferative disorders ( cmpds ) and corresponding reactive bone marrow lesions were enrolled into this study .    2.128635831459941
apoptosis was detected in bone marrow tissue by the UNK - technique and topoisomerase ii expression was demonstrated by the monoclonal antibody ki - s1 .    2.6569440072200146
furthermore , by determination of the proliferating - cell nuclear antigen labeling ( pcna ) index , we were able to calculate the proportion of cells in the g2 / m phase , because both nuclear antigens are expressed in different phases of the cell cycle .    2.245354444200901
on the other hand , imf and pv were characterized by a raised proliferative activity .    2.246219748248427
dynamics of hematopoiesis was assessed by calculation of the so called hematopoietic turnover index .    2.6060330724966736
in cml and reactive lesions no alterations of this parameter were detectable , but imf and pv showed a significant increase .    2.3602402068864046
survival analysis disclosed a relevant worsening of life expectancy for patients with reduced apoptosis and proliferation .    2.6822966364064347
in conclusion , our in - situ results confirm and extend previous experimental data on hematopoietic cell kinetics .    2.0528260138842094
in this context , a greater regenerative capacity of hematopoiesis may be reflected by an increased rate of apoptosis and / or proliferation and therefore is associated with a more favorable outcome .    2.5672727276676857
in a complex animal model in sheep , polydioxanone ( pds ) and polylactic membranes were used for the reconstruction of large orbital - wall defects .    2.1374603922175126
in a long - term experiment over 1 year , polylactic implants alone showed the best performance as compared with combinations involving autogenous bone grafts and titanium miniplate fixation .    2.21195423643668
as soon as these polylactic implants are approved for human surgery , they will be used to solve the still challenging problem of anatomical reconstruction of large comminuted fractures of more than one orbital wall .    2.3297367244551026
surgery by three - dimensional ( 3d ) endoscopy is being used routinely in abdominal surgery and , in special cases , in thoracic surgery ; however , it has not been reported as being used in microlaryngeal surgery .    2.7097432094128755
we inserted a 3 - d endoscope into a jet laryngoscope and studied the pressure properties at the tip of the laryngoscope as well as intrapulmonary pressures while applying superimposed high - frequency jet ventilation .    2.3311639364743457
the studies were conducted initially using a lung simulator , and then in seven patients undergoing microlaryngeal surgery .    2.2301396526775403
the measurements on the lung simulator revealed that reduction of laryngoscope diameter leads to an increase in the following parameters : expiratory resistance , tidal volume , and peak inspiratory pressure .    2.3241653787776193
the mean fio2 was 0 . 74 + / - 0 . 1 ; the mean pao2 was 169 . 2 + / - 80 . 4 mm hg ; and the mean paco2 was 40 . 9 + / - 2 . 4 mm hg .    2.9129236001249206
the mean airway pressure was 19 + / - 5 . 3 mm hg prior to insertion of the endoscope and 12 . 3 + / - 6 . 9 mm hg after insertion .    2.840220273176498
the mean positive end - expiratory pressure values increased from 2 + / - 0 . 6 to 3 . 6 + / - 2 . 3 mm hg .    3.1755525621684084
reduction of the working pressure resulted in restoration of the initial inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes .    2.5610855918696496
in the clinical application of 3 - d endoscopy via a jet laryngoscope , it was possible to achieve sufficient ventilation , inspection of the surgical field , and performance of the surgical procedure .    2.9235505121787453
a co2 laser was used without changing the ventilation regime .    2.329599198262525
although technical alterations would be desirable for its application to microlaryngeal surgery , it is presently possible to safely use the 3 - d endoscope via the jet laryngoscope for microlaryngeal surgery , presenting the surgeon with new possibilities in voice - improving microsurgery of the larynx .    2.168143249285177
UNK specimens of cystic ducts were used for displacement tests to investigate the security of different laparoscopic clips .    2.3845224240653673
the cystic duct was fixed , and the transverse placed clips were UNK in axial direction and the forces registered .    2.399085245603727
the median values of the six investigated clips ranged between 4 . 1 n and 11 . 2 n with a highly significant difference ( p < 0 . 001 , kruskal - wallis anova ) .    2.271472282360575
in detail , both resorbable clips ( polydioxanone , UNK / UNK acetate ) were superior to the four titanium clips ( p < 0 . 005 , wilcoxon test ) .    2.356231466599409
in addition to the advantage of complete UNK , these data favour the use of absorbable clips because holding force is better than that of titanium clips .    2.5259644803740233
hemoglobin solutions and fluorocarbon emulsions are evaluated as artificial oxygen carriers .    2.252401132586347
the efficacy of hemoglobin solutions with respect to o2 transport and especially the effective o2 release to tissues has been demonstrated in a number of situations , such as extreme hemodilution and hemorrhagic shock .    2.7118867630612145
the hemoglobin molecule could be stabilized by genetic and chemical modifications .    2.343104081662645
this results in a clinically UNK intravascular half - life of about 8 - 24 h , an adequate o2 affinity , and a lack of nephrotoxicity .    2.6770822523666182
a degree of vasoconstriction must be mentioned as the persistent side effect of the hemoglobin solutions evaluated here .    2.353192250532686
in spite of this , hemoglobin solutions are also well tolerated in humans .    2.369623153586672
fluorocarbon emulsions are compounds with a very high gas solubility and are , therefore , well suited for the transport of o2 and co2 .    2.3495732993207366
the capacity for the release of o2 to the tissues is especially excellent .    2.406815810015398
this was demonstrated under extreme hemodilution , during extracorporeal circulation and also under reanimation .    2.2002721608421827
the introduction of artificial oxygen carriers to clinical practice will greatly change transfusion medicine and also the acute care of trauma patients .    2.21419245516603
UNK is expected within the next few years .    2.4952660467142134
the new volatile anaesthetic desflurane is characterized by very low blood - gas and tissue - blood UNK coefficients , so that rapid induction of anaesthesia and shorter recovery times can be expected .    2.3932584093571845
the aim of this investigation was to compare the effects of desflurane and isoflurane on haemodynamics and recovery time when used as part of a balanced anaesthesia technique for elective surgery .    2.344982990319031
in acute coronary syndromes , arteriosclerotic plaques are characterized by inflammation and decreased smooth muscle cell density .    2.300225771828113
the underlying pathogenic processes remain unclear .    2.420960031156461
among others , increased programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) is postulated .    2.3650131002233974
coronary atherectomy specimens from 26 patients with unstable angina ( group 1 ) and from 24 patients with stable angina ( group 2 ) were examined , using immunohistochemistry ( UNK test to detect fragmented dna ) and transmission electron microscopy .    2.563994041549843
the objectives of the present study were to evaluate plaque group differences in the cellular composition , to detect and quantify cell death , and to UNK between apoptosis and necrosis .    2.669107339264632
on UNK of the UNK UNK of heart surgery we present in this article the first successful experimental open heart operations in UNK in the years from 1926 to 1937 .    3.2848698280048825
these operations on the stationary heart were carried out by using the first device for extracorporeal circulation .    2.6347141277677006
this work UNK by UNK scientist s . UNK and the surgeon n . terebinski is nearly unknown to the medical public .    2.764861593276219
the first and largest series at the time worldwide of more than 260 operations on the valves of the open heart , the still valid prophylactic procedure to avoid air embolism , and principles of open heart surgery stated by n . terebinski were decades UNK of the development at the time .    2.4580568927624804
in the authors ' opinion they represent a milestone in the history of open heart surgery .    2.424375350280047
aneurysms of the temporal part of the carotid artery are unusually rare .    3.294262456935785
the literature contains only a few previous reports dealing with hemorrhage from such malformations .    2.311643302827845
in the present case massive bleeding occurred from a right - sided intrapetrous UNK after myringotomy , which was performed as treatment for bilateral secretory otitis media .    2.2887685853587585
due to the absence of any specific symptoms and the masking effect of middle ear glue preoperative identification of the aneurysm was not possible .    2.816870425958494
subsequent angiography showed the large fusiform extension of the intrapetrous aneurysm as well as multiple intracranial aneurysms .    2.6209797973947038
leakage from the aneurism was closed definitively with muscle , fascia lata and a UNK - UNK - formalin - glue ( cardial ) .    2.350895748541545
in order to apply the tissue patch the UNK site of the aneurism was exposed using a posterior UNK approach .    2.2174734684800645
due to extensive intracranial collateralization to the vertebral arteries bleeding persisted even after ligation of both carotid arteries .    1.9959762100372873
temporary cardiac asystole was then induced to allow safe closure of the aneurysm .    2.430423448431027
following surgery the patient sustained loss of hearing in her ear and a partial peripheral facial palsy .    2.2209522415270206
blindness causes human suffering and high social costs .    2.3601810047287883
virtually all blind people are registered with the social services .    2.3686270082517966
data from these institutions may help in ( long - term ) planning for blindness prevention .    2.5135668399682545
the stage - oriented treatment of stem varicosis is the operation method of choice .    2.37335522958727
after surgery on a group of 1000 patients , we examined the stumps for patency , the occurrence of varicose changes , for their availability in the long term , and the sufficiency of their length for aortocoronary or peripheral bypass surgery .    2.479372584447688
the treatment of insufficient UNK veins was also included in the surgical therapy , as well as postoperative sclerotherapy of remaining lateral veins .    2.851740484173271
with a follow - up period of up to 33 months postoperatively , the results show a high patency rate in the remaining stumps ( 97 % ) , as well as a high sufficiency rate ( 94 % ) , with a mean graft length of 29 . 4 cm .    3.1773582085513294
thus these stumps constitute a good natural graft for future vascular reconstructions .    2.133218397038876
this study supports the call for the stage - oriented surgical treatment of stem varicosis .    2.482832440065459
background : corneal hla - dr antigens are going to be lost during organ culture storage .    2.105984296187382
the authors present a rare case of solitary non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) in the skull of an 11 - year - old girl .    2.6163290728187008
the clinical , radiological and histological findings as well as a review of the literature are included in this report .    3.215484040055893
the morphological features of intra - and extracerebral tumor masses and the change in tumor extension due to chemotherapy and radiation therapy were evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging .    2.3633285838980918
although rare , nhl should be considered in the differential diagnosis of skull tumors in children .    2.4980501565886377
neurodegenerative and dementing disorders such as parkinson disease and alzheimer disease are among the most common diseases of advanced age .    2.337922613923521
the neuropathological diagnosis and classification of neurodegenerative disorders has made clear advances in recent years , particularly due to the results of genetic and biochemical studies , resulting in the development of new disease - specific antibodies .    2.9498730617173456
internationally recognized consensus criteria for most neurodegenerative disorders allow a definite and standardized diagnosis to be made .    2.047033416401017
to obtain further knowledge about the etiopathogenesis , particularly with regard to new therapeutic strategies , studies with clinically and neuropathologically well - documented cases are needed .    2.572799681845145
the project " brain - net " has therefore been established with the aim of setting up a german brain and tissue bank for diseases of the central nervous system .    2.368299349192298
the project is funded by the federal ministry of education and research .    2.3084195415881497
fetal surgery is defined as the intrauterine surgical correction of malformations that endanger the UNK child ' s life in prenatal stages of development or lead to death or severe damage of the child postnatally .    2.3113961628106714
such surgery is a clinical reality now .    3.001880466945062
indications for UNK surgical procedures also exist for head and neck abnormalities , especially in the upper respiratory tract .    2.8440583055870725
these include exposure and temporary obstruction of the fetal trachea for correction of pulmonary hypoplasia in cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernias , prenatal tracheotomy in cases of laryngeal atresia for the correction of lethal pulmonary UNK , and resection of embryonic tumors that UNK the respiratory tract .    2.5587468398428355
the relatively high surgical risk resulting in particular from preterm labor occurring postoperatively may be reduced by employing minimally invasive techniques .    2.1026796321358
endoscopic procedures render opening of the uterus unnecessary and are of particular importance .    2.283540408908418
in part of the procedures , only endoscopic surgery has led to therapeutic success rates justifying its clinical use .    2.6413045125539334
further reduction of the operative risk suggests prenatal interventions , even in cases with non - lethal conditions .    3.1910909544090678
more diseases of the head and neck may thus be included in the spectrum of indications .    3.217485988988449
one example is prenatal correction of a cleft lip and palate , which until now has only been performed in animal experiments .    2.2835224703586667
the particular characteristics of fetal wound healing allow this to take place without scarring up to a certain stage in pregnancy .    2.207809205931701
this offers the prospect of a surgical correction that is UNK externally and avoids growth - UNK scars .    2.1206348476672665
the particular ethical and legal aspects of fetal surgery are discussed .    2.419145631109337
we report on a 57 - year - old patient suffering from a complex malposition of proximal femur after osteosynthesis using a condylar plate .    2.2350364348479137
for UNK correction of the proximal femur we successfully used an intramedullary hip screw system .    2.6201069212968027
in 6 patients with primary malignant bone tumors ( 4 ewing , 1 recurrent UNK , 1 UNK UNK ) the local therapy was performed as intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation .    2.4492419592571437
during the follow - up 10 ( 6 - 24 ) months no local recurrence in the replanted segment occurred .    2.6917463431603834
one recurrence occurred in the host bed ; in two cases the replanted segment had to be removed because of severe infection .    2.9437970446933486
the other cases showed good functional and radiological results .    2.784286162595701
these clinical findings and the reports in the literature seem to allow the application of the intraoperative extracorporeal irradiation and replantation procedure for defect reconstruction in cases of chemo - and radiotherapy - sensitive bone tumors .    2.5752023401073476
effects of anaesthesia and analgesia on postoperative morbidity and mortality remain controversial .    2.729906367743282
numerous studies have demonstrated that epidural anaesthesia and pain relief by epidural analgesia reduces perioperative stress responses and thus may reduce postoperative morbidity and mortality .    2.2062587933161897
in patients undergoing vascular surgery , epidural anaesthesia diminished postoperative UNK .    2.3876537670887035
these patients may benefit from less thromboembolic complications as well as a reduced risk of a re - operation .    2.813258824257643
however , regional anaesthesia does not affect cardiopulmonary morbidity or overall mortality significantly in most clinical studies .    2.0558979552692787
one reason for this disappointing finding may be the missing integration of improved postoperative pain relief into general surgical care .    2.2972256452073347
a multimodal therapeutic approach , which consists of UNK patient information , sufficient analgesia , early mobilisation and enteral feeding , may solve this discrepancy .    2.145059586972966
therefore , prospective controlled studies are needed to assess the influence of this perioperative approach on outcome .    2.9427716423626205
although cerebrovascular diseases are the most common causes of dementia after alzheimer ' s desease , vascular dementia ( vd ) has remained so far an ill - defined term .    2.1910011989621605
the main problems in the definition of vd arise from finding criteria for both terms " vascular " and " dementia " .    2.4591514334107405
the detailed criteria for the diagnosis of vd proposed by several groups or institutions ( UNK , dsm - iv , icd - 10 , ninds - UNK ) are critically reviewed .    3.059910075744965
the diagnostic value of some clinical findings , especially the very frequent white matter UNK in ct ( UNK - UNK ) , are discussed .    2.9950177606923596
the available studies suggest a differentiation of vd into some subtypes ( listed according to frequency ) : subcortical vd , vd with acute onset , UNK - dementia , mixed types , and specific forms .    1.9901664525650835
nevertheless , these subtypes give only little information about the etiology of the underlying vascular process and , therefore , no clear indication for specific therapeutic strategies .    2.5319257426125503
the aetiology of varicosis is still unclear .    2.6263396369735603
investigation of changes in normal veins which result in the formation of varicosis led to examination of elastic properties and histomorphological alterations in the region of the extracellular matrix in the vessel wall of the long saphenous vein in normal and varicose veins .    2.454170377437418
the rigidity of varicose veins was higher than that of normal veins ; there was no difference between the varicose vein above a competent valve and the " normal " vein below this competent valve .    2.3132378196430072
the matrix proteins demonstrated an increase in total fibres , whereas the elastic fibres were reduced and fragmented , explained the rigidity of varices .    2.397265617650776
these results suggest that the role of the venous valves in the development of varicose veins is secondary to changes of the vein wall .    3.060149931903477
an investigation of 122 knee joints was performed concerning the incidence and morphological characteristics of the UNK ligaments ( mfl ) UNK and wrisberg .    2.7150632871456852
the osseous parameters of the dorsal and ventral notch as well as the UNK width did not correlate with the incidence of mfl .    3.1460449849051817
the ventral notch width index ( UNK ) after UNK was 0 . 22 in females and 0 . 24 in males .    2.7275008263867533
a dorsal notch width index ( UNK ) , which has not been described so far , was 0 . 26 in females and 0 . 28 in males .    2.955923841218707
the ligamentum UNK posterius ( wrisberg ) showed distinct morphological variations .    2.1287218201006266
this resulted in a classification of type i - iii .    3.315902262375789
the results of the study underline the importance of the mfl for knee joint function including stabilization , proprioception , and meniscal positioning .    2.331490176552612
for pdt , 5 - aminolevulinic acid ( 5 - ala ) was given orally ( 60 mg / kg ) and treated endoscopically with a light dose of 150 j / cm2 ( 100 mw / cm2 ) at UNK nm 4 - 6 h later .    2.280046913770917
a second pdt was performed under the same conditions 2 - 3 weeks later .    2.5957950265559817
patients who received apc were treated 4 times on average to reach radical barrett mucosa eradication .    2.130458440851404
all patients were consistently given medication to suppress acid production .    2.169769734305414
no complications occurred in either group .    2.5037074303386326
follow - up UNK and multiple biopsies for 3 - 42 months showed squamous regeneration in the dysplastic columnar - lined oesophagus in all 11 patients .    2.083960177689491
two patients with squamous carcinoma were found to have a recurrence 9 and 12 months later .    3.085436837672072
pdt with 5 - ala - induced endogenous UNK , as well as apc combined with omeprazole protection , can eradicate superficial high - grade dysplastic mucosa in barrett ' s oesophagus .    2.2553423103335595
however , we did not succeed in UNK a manifest carcinoma .    2.460355510605952
technical advantages of spiral technology are of great usefulness in diagnostic imaging of thorax and abdomen in children .    2.1440027805665745
the rapid imaging time allows the examination of an entire organ while scanning with breath holding or while the child is UNK breathing , resulting in a decreased need for sedation .    2.100504078497967
in addition especially examinations of the chest an to some extend ct - investigations of the abdomen are performed with reduced radiation dose achieved by reducing the tube loading .    2.236696405449687
radiation dose reduction of 70 % is possible without loss of relevant diagnostic information .    2.4729622862927862
spiral low - dose ct in pediatric chest imaging is useful in evaluating parenchymal lung diseases , mediastinal masses and central airway malformations .    2.1938906698290794
whether abdominal helical ct can be replaced by mri has to be decided in each individual case .    2.5035518000029713
when an exact protocol is used , sufficient contrast material given , scan - delay optimized and UNK reconstructions are performed , usefull additional diagnostic informations are obtained by the method .    2.0688158950933238
invasive monitoring is a standard procedure in modern intensive care medicine .    2.8471597483947435
despite significant progress in the routine use and catheter technology , there are relevant remaining risks concerning acute central venous and arterial access and chronic persistence of catheters within the vascular lumen .    2.2028375822028523
resulting from the UNK established novel definition of antiseptic which contains the local application of antiseptics for UNK , preventive or therapeutical indication on skin , mucous membrane , wounds , in body cavities or on surgical exposed resp .    2.0284441016019508
opened UNK areas the UNK indications in a branch of dermatology and UNK diseases are represented .    2.19432187458236
with the analysis of the actual knowledge in vitro and in vivo requirements to local UNK are defined combined with the recommendations for the clinical use .    2.8779520125388762
at present mainly prophylactically used agents are submitted to a benefit risk analysis with refer to the choice of agents .    2.13582275547404
thereby agents for the application on skin as well as on genitals , in mouth cavity and on wounds were taken into consideration .    2.406967202767943
despite the benign nature of the disease it is one of the problematic fields of surgery due to the high complication rate and long hospital stay .    2.9867608327998423
based on our experience we recommend evacuation of the cyst and omentoplasty as the surgical method of choice , as it is associated with a relatively low incidence of complications and can be performed easily .    3.026169954564225
background : central catheters in UNK intensive care patients are used for the prolonged application of UNK or parenteral infusions .    2.716407780175322
dislocations and septic and thromboembolic complications may occur .    2.5205033436514226
low density lipoproteins are heterogeneous in UNK size , density , and physical as well as chemical properties .    2.4410244800615555
regarding size and density , ldl can be divided into two main profiles , ldl pattern a with elevated concentration of large , UNK ldl particles and ldl pattern b with increased concentration of small , dense ldl particles .    1.9084151733123884
the latter is particularly expressed in insulin resistance and is associated with elevated serum triglycerides and reduced concentrations of hdl and particularly hdl2 cholesterol .    2.08608939296319
the ldl profile of increased concentration of small , dense ldl particles has shown to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events .    2.3908787346039984
the ldl profile is partly genetically determined , but can be improved by non - pharmacological ( exercise , diet ) and pharmacological intervention .    2.3169726073525405
it remains to be confirmed whether the ldl UNK profile is an independent lipid risk factor besides hdl2 cholesterol and triglycerides , but it is certainly a valuable indicator assessing metabolic cardiovascular risk .    2.0537432364564503
traumatic injuries of arteries lead to acute bleeding or ischemia .    2.369110787051
in the hand , which is perfused by two arteries , this symptom could be missed .    2.578908357347
the UNK hammer syndrome is a traumatic occlusion of the distal UNK UNK .    3.0997516019313456
dependent on the mechanism of the trauma the clinical symptoms may appear late .    3.263033783132961
a specific angiographic or duplex sonographic diagnostic investigation is necessary to show the arterial occlusion .    2.5552287731781935
there is no proven therapeutic procedure .    2.5823503910868775
exact diagnosis of the occlusion as an effect of the trauma is important for the patient and is the basis of any therapeutic intervention .    3.7689403651637536
the administration of epidural opioids is alternatively used in the management of postoperative analgesia .    3.118116165316757
however , the administration is associated with side effects , including respiratory depression , somnolence and pruritus .    2.764519574478138
a rational opioid selection between the hydrophilic and lipophilic opioids morphine , hydromorphone , alfentanil , fentanyl and sufentanil is discussed in this mini - review .    2.0059601035798664
thus , the administration of the lipophilic opioid sufentanil might has some advantages .    2.5143047577350726
UNK , epidural opioid administration alone offers no marked clinical advantages compared to the intravenous route .    2.4980495842172337
in future , reduced doses of lipophilic opioids and local anaesthetics like bupivacaine 0 . 05 - 0 . 1 % may provide benefits over the use of either drug alone and may offer marked clinical advantages over the intravenous route of opioids alone .    2.4119437370995973
the same holds true for 2 - adrenoceptor agonists as UNK .    2.3316252754834084
however , multicenter dose - ranging studies are necessary to determine both the ideal concentrations of the drug combinations and the general outcome .    2.408541094350178
moreover , we must also determine cost effectiveness for our postoperative analgesic techniques .    2.2679564987398715
today the relevance of renal tumor embolization is not determined only by the technical and clinical success of the method .    2.6330129130474034
progress in diagnosis of early stages of renal carcinomas as well as the improvement of both surgical techniques and anesthetic procedures have lead to a change in the selection of patients for embolization .    3.391337408659844
preoperative embolization of advanced renal cell carcinomas with tumor thrombus into the vena cava or of t4 tumors is now an established clinical procedure .    2.1156327111745257
the complete occlusion of the vascular bed of the tumors leads to a considerable reduction in intraoperative blood loss and to simplification of the surgical preparation .    3.0890714312716137
by using UNK for embolization , palliation of a hemorrhage or of tumor - related pain in inoperable patients is usually successful .    2.3114411718275707
this short life expectancy in the group of inoperable patients has to be acknowledged individually in patients considered for palliative embolization who are free of symptoms related to the tumor .    2.7121591720856117
purpose : to evaluate whether primary stenting is superior to balloon angioplasty ( pta ) alone in the treatment of femoropopliteal obstructive disease .    2.4582180383982664
content of this paper is the current state of the art of robots in surgery and the ongoing work on the field of surgical robotics at the clinic for maxillofacial surgery at the charité .    2.5177315176312494
robots in surgery allows the surgeon to transform the accuracy of the imaging systems directly during the intervention and to plan an intervention beforehand .    2.3708528427131963
in this paper firstly the state of the art is described .    2.442279819447535
subsequently the scientific work at the clinic is described in detail .    2.4694556832188668
the paper UNK with a outlook for future applications of robotics systems in maxillofacial surgery .    2.2716603839287868
giant - cell bone tumors display a locally aggressive growth pattern , frequently recur if no adjuvant treatment is given , and may potentially metastasize .    2.06586967597408
by virtue of their biological behavior and typically juxta - articular localization , giant - cell bone tumors require specific surgical management .    2.022346243805969
thus , an intralesional tumor excision must be supplemented by adjuvant bone UNK , possibly combined with instillation of UNK or cryotherapy .    2.0717508978442982
these combined treatment modalities assure a high - quality procedure , defined as the actual way medical care is delivered , by promoting the quality of the outcome , defined as the effect of a medical procedure on the patient ' s state of health .    2.820288953856293
chromosomal analysis of the family shows a familial balanced translocation of the chromosomes 7 and 17 in the parents and other relatives .    2.405521801781282
UNK analysis reveals abortions , frequent miscarriages and early infant deaths .    2.1365083205266857
our patients show the same chromosomal abnormality and nearly the same clinical symptoms : prominent forehead , hydrocephalus UNK with wide cranial sutures and UNK , hypertelorism , cleft soft palate , low set UNK ears , psychomotor retardation and UNK .    1.9637180846308202
renal cell carcinomas ( rcc ) are UNK with impressive metastatic potential .    2.805842485829956
patients with rcc who present with apparently solitary metastatic lesions represent a small cohort .    2.1154757553180086
due to the different long - term results achieved with surgical resection of metastatic rcc lesions , a generally accepted judgement about this treatment modality is not possible .    2.514946240535524
several studies suggest that aggressive surgical management can provide an effective treatment , especially in patients with solitary pulmonary metastases .    2.978393480690685
most noteworthy is the fact that because of the organ distribution of rcc metastases , surgical therapy is dominated by general and thoracic surgeons , UNK , and orthopaedic surgeons .    2.850458694817958
therefore , an interdisciplinary approach is one of the most important key points for a successful outcome in these patients .    2.7639293833752876
the term langerhans cell histiocytosis , previously " histiocytosis x " , encompasses three different syndromes : eosinophilic granuloma of bone , hand - UNK - christian disease and UNK - UNK UNK disease .    2.341962929088243
all are rare manifestations in childhood .    2.5700552992085286
we report on a 10 year old boy presenting with a swelling in the occipital region and clinical signs of elevated intracranial pressure .    2.343265870037411
the tentative diagnosis after examination , conventional radiologic procedures and computerized tomography was eosinophilic granuloma .    2.1010508439986326
magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance imaging - angiography revealed the acute threat to the child caused by the intracranial expanding mass lesion with almost complete obstruction of the UNK UNK .    2.715024460260455
thrombosis and the risk of bleeding were decreased by early and complete exstirpation of the tumor .    2.737839044283278
after two years follow - up , no new lesions had appeared .    2.81880216342442
the diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen is a rare splenic proliferation .    2.672691660839899
spontaneous rupture is the main , potentially lethal complication , found in 25 % of cases .    2.7439603217213113
the problem with these vascular tumors is preoperative diagnosis , because they are asymptomatic for a long time .    2.2988128248000965
first - choice therapy is limited resection .    2.700965458249623
in the case of rupture , splenectomy is a life - saving procedure .    2.57415990313058
we report on a 56 - year - old woman with a spontaneous splenic rupture as the first symptom of diffuse angiomatosis of the spleen .    2.208447604160451
exceptional features of splenic hemangiomas , causes of spontaneous rupture and the therapy are described .    2.2132057457843026
the hypothesis of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) as a t cell mediated disease has led to the development of numerous therapeutic approaches that target the function of t cells .    2.644198908447559
the development of monoclonal antibodies against the t cell surface molecule cd4 has raised UNK to achieve a major progress in the treatment of ra .    2.7426349120912734
however , after encouraging results in early open studies , double blind trials were unable to demonstrate the efficacy of anti - cd4 - therapy in ra .    2.4941554558731815
there are numerous reasons to explain the failure of this treatment approach .    2.556392901477812
besides the fact that the t cell hypothesis of ra has repeatedly been challenged , pharmacological problems or an inappropriate selection of outcome criteria have to be considered .    2.1252725996520434
the final evaluation of anti - cd4 therapy in ra will be possible only after the testing of newly developed non - UNK anti - cd4 anti - bodies .    2.3299343098387815
purpose : for some time , the ambulatory diagnosis of respiratory disturbances during sleep has included the use of seven - channel recording units .    2.3716866450059806
one of these systems is the poly - UNK unit ( map , germany ) .    2.291100551363303
guanine nucleotide - binding proteins ( g proteins ) function as transducers of information across the cell membrane by coupling receptors to effectors .    1.9047664352598703
a large number of g protein - linked receptors funnel extra - cellular signals as diverse as hormones , growth factors , neurotransmitters , and primary sensory stimuli through a set of g proteins to a small number of second - messenger systems .    2.030410996172577
the g proteins act as molecular switches with an " on " and " off " state governed by a gtpase cycle .    2.135493352833752
by virtue of its high affinity and specificity for guanine nucleotide binding and its intrinsic gtpase activity , the - subunit of the g protein ( g ) plays the critical role in regulation of the effectors by their corresponding g protein .    1.9264814632187544
mutations of g may result in either constitutive activation or loss of expression mutations .    2.3308665646894866
given the variety of functions UNK by g protein - coupled signal transduction , it is not surprising that abnormalities in g protein - coupled pathways can lead to diseases with manifestations as UNK as blindness , hormone resistance , precocious puberty and neoplasia .    2.144036596830614
for a given defect in a g protein - coupled pathway , the extent of the manifestations will also be determined by the cellular distribution of the affected component .    2.715433390341648
defects in components expressed exclusively in a single cell type will cause more a focal disorder than defects in a widely expressed component , particularly in germline mutations ( e . g . , albright ' s hereditary UNK ) , whereas somatic mutations of genes encoding even an UNK expressed component can cause focal disease when the somatic mutation itself is focal ( e . g . , UNK - albright syndrome ) .    2.0591504115301618
mivacurium is a short - acting , UNK muscle relaxant of the UNK type that undergoes rapid breakdown by plasma cholinesterase .    2.586866248070372
after 2 . 5 times the ed95 ( 0 . 2 mg / kg ) , tracheal intubation can be accomplished within 2 - 3 min following injection .    2.7957761826189973
the ensuing UNK 25 % ( i . e . , time from injection to 25 % recovery of control twitch tension ) is three times as long as with succinylcholine .    2.1861060227442763
the principal side effects of mivacurium are facial flushing and a transient fall in blood pressure due to moderate histamine release following doses 3 - 4 times the ed95 .    2.2156255603012194
in patients with end - stage liver or renal disease as well as those with atypical plasma cholinesterase , the duration of action of mivacurium is prolonged .    2.7094362757452926
the performance of new cryoprobes was studied by measuring the spatial and temporal patterns of the temperature distribution in liver tissue around one to three active cryoprobes .    2.2345277497870986
with three cryoprobes , using the synergistic cooling effect , a tissue region 45 mm in diameter was UNK to temperatures below - 50 °c .    2.194881826170987
optimal placement of the cryoprobes was found to be of critical importance .    3.202138050466707
attachment representation was assessed in 48 elderly people with an average age of 69 years .    2.5212705803646074
the adult attachment interview was used plus an additional question about wishes for the future .    2.098197891921351
coherent correlations with subjective life satisfaction and individual future perspective were demonstrated .    2.1747532032475125
elderly participants with secure attachment representation were more satisfied , they were also less anxious , and more often positive about their future .    2.1777987747175316
if their adult children had secure attachment representation , they were reported by their elderly parents to be socially , UNK , and UNK more supportive .    2.516216199370387
magnetic resonance imaging represents today the most important tool in UNK for both clinical UNK and research .    2.6385502568144354
mri allows imaging of the human body in 2 or 3 dimensions with variable tissue contrast .    2.74061792714628
the natural diffusion of tissue UNK can now be used as a supplementary contrast mechanism .    2.69276247009837
different mri techniques can be used to obtain clinically useful diffusion - weighted images .    2.5325985864358582
these techniques all require the use of strong gradient pulses in order to obtain the diffusion contrast .    2.785982289429815
in the current article , the most important physical principles of diffusion measurement are presented .    2.6063725284181265
after a short introduction into the basic physical principles , we will present the prerequisites and limitations of clinically relevant applications today .    2.3796558311436815
finally a few select examples of clinical use of these techniques in the acute diagnosis of stroke will be presented .    2.8348092770918014
the effects of chronical strains on physical or psychological health are subject of this paper .    2.3731490155265886
stress - related symptoms of family UNK of dementia patients have been proven in various studies .    2.659670196609428
for this group of people an analysis of the health UNK factors is regarded as to be especially important .    3.057164898549486
diary investigations allow to identify the individual assessment ( by the caring person ) of factors related to the care situation and to recognize the health and quality of sleep have been used as indicators regarding the state of health .    2.535781952486197
in this study strong differences in the individual view of stress factors and their effects on psychological an physical state of the caring person are shown .    2.3659273499616784
the causes of residual deformity with posttraumatic painful arthritis after UNK ( lisfranc ) fracture - dislocation with the need for UNK arthrodesis are in our experience ( 22 cases over 5 years ) UNK injuries in one third , closed reduction and immobilisation or inadequate fixation technique with k - wires in another two thirds of cases .    2.0694977379250723
foot malalignment and residual instability is assessed with weight - bearing radiographs of both feet , adduction / abduction stress films and ct scans for complex deformity .    1.9792297891486248
correction is carried out via two longitudinal dorsal incisions , strict UNK preparation and debridement of the lisfranc joint of all remaining cartilage , sclerosis and fibrous tissue .    1.923918466598362
reorientation begins , in the same manner as primary open reduction , with anatomical alignment of the second metatarsal base to the second UNK .    2.789367277084817
defects are filled with autologous bone grafting , stable fusion can be achieved with 3 . 5 mm cancellous compression screws .    2.6908637673573725
full weight bearing is allowed in a UNK plaster shoe for 6 to 8 weeks .    2.5963959664879623
the functional medium - term results are convincing with 15 of 17 patients seen after 13 months of follow - up working full time .    2.5667700061816925
the author of this paper UNK it very necessary to UNK chinese tuina , a traditional chinese medical subject , so as to make chinese tuina conform to recent research results and formulation , as well as to combine chinese tuina with western manual medicine at the clinic .    2.1024401866255245
this paper is the result of my research during the period of time was in switzerland working together with prof . UNK UNK .    2.5408730727786493
the operability of a liver tumour depends on its three - dimensional relation to the intrahepatic vascular trees which define UNK functioning liver ( sub - ) segments .    2.1695769216518905
the aim of our study was to establish a computer - based three - dimensional volumetric operation planning system for the liver .    2.4541332408213123
methods : using data from routine helical ct scans the three tissue UNK of liver parenchyma , liver vessels and liver tumour were UNK UNK .    1.9934180370757009
a dedicated UNK tool was established using region growing algorithms in combination with an " intelligent " border UNK .    2.2550858552135167
visualisation is performed by the " heidelberg UNK " .    2.8821603000978797
the vascular trees are visualised as 3d graphs .    2.3501096110883735
UNK between portal and hepatic venous trees are separated automatically .    2.222235514251468
security margins are calculated and the system presents a virtual resection proposal .    2.213487815781975
results : the 3d anatomy of the liver can be visualised in high quality resulting in good depth perception .    2.305903216130062
dependent liver parenchyma can be recognised automatically on the basis of the vascular trees .    2.8434448198245357
the system offers a individualised resection proposal including the tumour , security margin and dependent liver parenchyma .    2.093184127009967
conclusion : three - dimensional presentation of the individual liver anatomy of a given patient facilitates the perception of the pathology .    2.7192622811014764
virtual reality combined with artifical intelligence allows calculation of complete resection protocols , which can be quantified and modified UNK .    2.213806967274433
this will make operation planning more objective ; patient selection may be improved , and in cases of difficult tumour localisation different resection strategies may be tested .    2.445450742457346
thus virtual reality in liver surgery will improve teaching , surgical training and planning .    2.0956425251661384
it may lead to improved surgical care .    3.0630531110878594
methods to predict the rate of spontaneous relapses in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation and the effectiveness of antiarrhythmic agents are missing .    2.862327489004919
p - wave signal averaging might be helpful in this setting .    2.8872613559877895
however , correct validation and standardization is strongly needed for p - wave analysis with the high resolution ecg .    2.2873424792688595
signal averaging triggered to the p - wave is significantly superior to qrs - triggering .    2.2676825300688357
bidirectional filtering or UNK - filtering is necessary .    2.686756376344631
the data indicate significant differences in p - wave duration between patients with and without paroxysmal artrial fibrillation .    2.593227065168307
class i antiarrhythmic agents demonstrate a significant prolongation of p - wave duration , but did not influence spectral parameters .    2.2587246940455947
treatment with sotalol reduces high frequency p - wave energy without altering p - wave duration .    2.3283888728603337
after optimizing the methods , p - wave analysis offers promise to separate patients prone to atrial fibrillation and normals .    2.326762078026537
in addition , the evaluation of antiarrhythmic efficacy in patients with high risk of recurrent atrial fibrillation might be possible .    3.048666682044278
in the majority of cases right atrial or ventricular thrombi represent pulmonary emboli in transit .    2.235277114579714
in literature the incidence of right heart thrombi in patients with proven pulmonary embolism is said to be in the range of 3 - 4 % .    3.301085532945303
extremely mobile , long , UNK - shaped masses in the right heart cavities carry an especially high early thrombus - related mortality rate which ranges from 30 - 40 % .    2.345583038470025
current therapeutic strategies favour fibrinolytic therapy with consecutive anticoagulation .    2.4601195962078277
in the last years , several studies addressed the role of the different antithrombotic therapeutics in unstable angina pectoris .    2.778688108827122
acetylsalicylic acid still is the standard treatment reducing the rate of death and myocardial infarction by 50 % in the first six months .    3.308862173141155
UNK has no clinical effect in the first six days and therefore is not suited for treatment in the acute phase .    3.0210956699779827
unfractionated heparin has an additional favourable effect when added to aspirin .    2.202137456453706
low molecular weight - heparin is at least as effective as uf - heparin .    2.467333869190698
direct thrombin - inhibitors ( hirudin , hirudin - UNK ) seem to be comparable to uf - heparin .    2.530579732013671
gp iib / iiia - antagonists ( antibodies , synthetic antagonists ) significantly improve the clinical effects of aspirin .    2.0845323077862012
when combined with a reduced dose of heparin , their favourable effect remains unchanged , while bleeding complications are reduced to a minimum .    2.2925417666611634
the study presents data on cardiovascular malformations in bavarian UNK , born between 1984 and 1991 .    2.2338196729130466
cases have been ascertained retrospectively by reviewing hospital records of all children being referred to a children ' s hospital up to 2 years of age .    2.2497567717968683
severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa with oral involvement often leads to dental destruction and restricted food intake , resulting in malnutrition and maldevelopment .    2.093732943635427
the patients become handicapped and have a poor prognosis .    2.4006961010293777
we report on a now 13 - year - old UNK child with normal secondary dentition who had severely damaged primary dentition .    2.124498618696373
the teeth were treated surgically and then by continuous dental hygiene measures over the next 7 years .    2.2227547173602002
this care also resulted in an improvement in the nutritional state , associated anemia and the incidence of skin infections .    2.699792499362858
although cutaneous blistering and scarring has been progressive , with resulting UNK of the fingers , the child is socially well adjusted in school and family .    2.265369899972447
its clinical course demonstrates that the fate of patients with severe dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa can be improved through multidisciplinary management .    2.709873839701755
our understanding of ulcer pathogenesis has dramatically changed since the discovery of UNK pylori .    2.257562618116904
peptic ulcer is now recognized as a chronic gastric infectious disease .    2.275969182316855
h . pylori can be considered the pacemaker , with other known risk factors ultimately contributing to the ulcer formation .    2.5904304866455283
in clinical management a positive diagnosis of h . pylori is required and other potential causes for ulcer formation must be excluded before starting treatment .    2.0972549594644248
the standard treatment in h . pylori positive ulcer consists of ppi in standard dose and two antibiotics either clarithromycin 2 x 500 mg and UNK 2 x 1 g or metronidazole 2 x 400 mg and clarithromycin 2 x 250 mg ( or 500 mg ) for 7 days .    1.8265541239785068
the simultaneous presence of h . pylori and nsaid intake requires distinct management .    2.204578551114777
following bleeding complication a ppi needs to be given beyond 7 days until ulcer healing is endoscopically confirmed .    2.0848934573682616
we present the results of a study conducted in collaboration with the german workers ' board to monitor the effectiveness of treatment in 477 cases .    2.7604254557937575
the examiners reviewed the charts of patients who had suffered UNK or luxation of the knee , fractures of the spine with or without neural deficits , calcaneus fractures , rotator cuff lesions and shoulder luxation , and fractures of the acetabulum and pelvis as the result of accidents .    2.7746560209837017
a new documentation sheet was UNK to note administrative and medical data .    2.4693143818641925
all 477 patients ' charts and x - rays were reviewed by three trauma surgeons , and procedures were monitored in a prospective manner .    2.3416327861603423
the study revealed considerable discrepancies between the assumed injuries and those ultimately found to have been sustained , especially in the case of knee injuries .    2.515228678898497
the article reveals the results concerning the validity of the diagnosis and the need for more precisely tailored diagnostic methods for different patient groups .    2.6367926070115724
our final conclusion is that it is necessary to implement new paths of patient management and better steering features to improve both the quality of medical care and the administrative procedures in place .    2.3697437477989918
a workshop on attenuated cold - adapted influenza virus vaccines ( UNK ) was organized in UNK , germany on december 16 - 17 , 1998 by prof . UNK UNK , president of the paul ehrlich institute .    2.4191926222693296
reperfusion injury has become a scientific problem of increasing importance , in part because of recent developments of thrombolytic therapy .    2.47102105985536
the mechanisms of reperfusion injury following focal cerebral ischemia , however , are not known in detail .    2.8583055067019627
recent studies strongly suggest that reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and calcium overload play an important role in reperfusion injury and that pharmacological interventions against calcium - or free radical - mediated damage could extend the therapeutic window in cerebral ischemia / reperfusion .    1.892494609311527
the mediators involved are known to induce a mitochondrial permeability transition ( pt ) during the reperfusion period , which is associated with UNK of mitochondrial respiration , loss of mitochondrial membrane potential , and a burst production of ros , leading to cellular death .    2.6605936034976727
the mitochondrial pt is considered to be a key process in reperfusion injury following cerebral ischemia , as also observed in other organs such as heart and liver .    2.430558374301576
pharmacological modulation of mitochondrial permeability changes have the potential to reduce tissue damage due to reperfusion .    2.2251350369123304
we performed an open clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of a 1 µg / h UNK implant for the treatment of newly and pretreated cytomegalovirus ( cmv ) retinitis in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) .    2.510668347186624
the purpose of this study was to compare the initial stiffness of two techniques for posterior interbody lumbar fusion ( plif ) by a finite element approach .    1.9229990885365582
thus a finite element model of a human l3 / 4 spinal segment was generated .    2.3462925648786546
stiffness of the intact model was tested under compression ( 600 n ) , torsion ( 25 nm ) and shearing forces ( 250 n ) without preload .    2.015998710868123
the results were compared to the stiffness following simulation of plif with two bak - cages and plif with two harms - cages and additional posterior screw - rod - osteosynthesis .    1.9878028873098141
plif with two bak - cages resulted in a loss of stiffness in compression , torsion and shearing .    2.148729404466104
plif with two harms - cages and posterior osteosynthesis resulted in an increase of stiffness in compression , torsion and shearing .    2.1715985852231996
tramadol , an analgesic with mean potency one tenth that of morphine is used UNK for the treatment of chronic and postoperative pain .    2.6345345603916774
previous reports have indicated that tramadol may induce seizure activity when given together with a selective UNK reuptake inhibitor ( ssri ) .    2.120186406528302
therefore , its major mode of action may be questioned which UNK is due to binding with the opioid receptor and partly due to the inhibition of monoamine reuptake .    2.4611517201799233
aim : the cause of a connatal hemiplegia was retrospectivly investigated in children born at term .    2.2770474412588064
the article gives a short review on the history of the field .    2.7892956369115995
first forensic cases were solved by the use of UNK UNK in the UNK century but the method has only developed to a professional level over the last 100 years .    3.0517504096556687
in europe , mainly french , UNK , english and scandinavian researchers have been responsible for maintaining the methods .    2.406061000579374
in france , an entomological police laboratory has been set up in UNK - UNK - bois .    2.822800522182517
in contrast to the united states of america where entomological evidence is accepted by the courts , the method has only just started to be accepted in germany .    2.1351055978516036
initially cooperation with the police and with judges might help to establish the analysis of arthropods as a routine tool in forensic science for germany .    2.3488779892171165
27 patients with sternocostoclavicular hyperostosis ( scc ) and / or UNK UNK ( pao ) were examined with whole body scintigraphy , conventional radiography , and other imaging modalities , such as ct , mri .    2.9810910104683424
25 of 27 patients with scch showed a characteristic high bullhorn - like uptake of the sternocostoclavicular region with the UNK UNK representing the skull and the inflamed sternocostoclavicular joints corresponding to the horns ( = bullhorn - sign ) .    2.127530427151777
scintigraphy revealed additional skeletal manifestations ( spondylitis , UNK , osteitis , UNK ) in 19 of the 27 patients with scch and / or pao .    3.0531122486581475
in combination with ppp or psoriasis UNK , the typical scintigraphic bullhorn pattern enables the diagnosis of pao ( 19 patients ) with high confidence .    2.79609208225948
patients with scch but without skin disease at the time of presentation ( 8 of 27 patients ) may develop ppp later and , therefore , it is justified to classify them as incomplete pao with high risk to develop other skeletal manifestations later in the course of the disease .    2.301663306790891
UNK stands for partial androgen deficiency in the aging male , and it is currently diagnosed with a testosterone level below 3 ng / ml ( 300 ng / dl or 12 UNK / l ) , and with symptoms varying according to the individual .    2.4932039999354836
the symptoms are a reduction or even loss of UNK , a decline in muscle mass and strength , enhancement of visceral fatty tissue - UNK , UNK of the skin , apathy , tiredness and distortion of mood right up to depression , and UNK due to osteoporosis .    2.9347159446339695
a 34 year - old pregnant woman presented with reticulate pigmentation of the UNK , the dorsum of the hands and the UNK region .    3.3768372587838527
she was in good health and her family history was unremarkable .    2.2948529959609214
histologic examination of the UNK patches revealed pigmented UNK UNK of the UNK epidermis and follicular UNK , as well as small epithelial cysts .    3.7970991031323704
the elongated dendritic processes of the melanocytes contained many mature melanosomes .    2.1578609320871154
in the adjacent keratinocytes large melanosomes did not UNK into complexes .    2.500657002716345
the diagnosis of localized reticulate pigmentary disorder was established .    2.497841676210175
the knowledge of the broad clinical spectrum of localized reticulate UNK with its favorable prognosis is of practical importance .    2.258361319430895
genital or UNK pigmented lesions have to be differentiated from UNK of the vulva or acanthosis nigricans .    3.1108783191029645
the presented case gives further evidence that many of the proposed entities characterized clinically by reticulate pigmented macules and hyperkeratotic follicular lesions are different phenotypic expressions of the same autosomal dominant genodermatosis .    1.9385463368665552
purpose : during the last few years there has been an increasing interest in evaluating quality of life ( qol ) data regarding surgical treatment .    2.462593790342452
methods : the present study comments the efficacy of laparoscopic antireflux surgery after required nissen fundoplication of 70 patients .    2.635980030818399
therefore , the german gastrointestinal quality of life index ( giqli ) was used to UNK the patients preoperatively and three times after surgery up to 1 year .    2.7302530699599483
results : preoperatively , we found a low general giqli score ( mean 92 . 7 points ) , which increased 6 weeks postoperatively ( 116 . 8 points ) , 3 months ( 124 . 8 ) and 1 year ( mean 123 . 9 points ) significantly and is now comparable to the healthy population ( 122 . 6 points ) .    2.3750374534010907
conclusion : it is our opinion that the efficacy of the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease with required nissen fundoplication can also be documented and discussed by using qol .    2.7864067913712915
introduction : serous UNK of the pancreas are rare tumors and thought to be almost always benign .    3.2071031714566636
methods : we report our experience in the diagnosis and surgical treatment of 12 patients with these tumors .    3.5862578025520238
results : between october 1993 and december 1998 , 41 patients with cystic tumors of the pancreas underwent surgical resection ; in 12 cases ( 11 women , 1 man ) a serous cystadenoma ( 10 UNK , 2 UNK ) was found .    2.4012691911981614
only 6 ( 50 % ) patients had symptoms .    3.1890228206296944
the mean tumor size was 4 . 8 ( 2 . 7 - 10 ) cm .    3.2155578869357404
ultrasound , ct and mrt usually could detect the mass , but differentiation with other cystic lesions was not reliable .    2.2076040236260375
all tumors were resected : 4 whipple procedures , 7 distal UNK and 1 segmental resection were performed .    2.1428184644637223
no patient died after surgery and none had to be reoperated on .    2.7742116632431335
conclusions : because of the difficulty in reliably differentiating benign and malignant lesions of the pancreas , we believe that cystic tumors of the pancreas should be resected .    2.810977571878621
we examined the prevalence of hiv - associated cutaneous disorders as well as the frequency and efficiency of uv - radiation in hiv - infected patients by evaluating the clinical records of UNK patients seen between and 1994 and 1996 .    2.850597130228037
uv - radiation proved to be efficient and safe in the treatment of pruritic papular eruption , atopic dermatitis and psoriasis .    2.6629237153324388
although some in vitro studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested a negative impact of uv radiation on the UNK of hiv - positive patients , no progression of the hiv infection due to phototherapy has been proven .    2.4766526745142183
the staff at interventional radiological procedures is exposed to high levels of ionizing radiation .    2.438197632964881
this applies especially to measures at cardiac catheterization laboratories .    2.2283789006538703
in this study the annual radiation exposure to the staff was estimated by measuring the dose rate under characteristic conditions .    2.1474782349433292
it could be shown that the resulting radiation exposure was strongly dependent on the radiation protection measures and is also dependent on the operation conditions of the x - ray tube .    2.720181910574948
the effective dose for the physician wearing a lead UNK and thyroid shield was UNK to about 1 . 7 msva .    2.527554573557392
this corresponds to approximately the natural background radiation of about 2 . 4 msva in the federal republic of germany .    2.257200942921059
from the number of procedures performed we could derive an effective dose of approximately 1 - 2 UNK per application for the physician , averaged over all types of procedures .    2.5109065592892286
further , it could be shown that the readings of the film badges , usually UNK by the staff , UNK the effective dose by approximately a factor of two .    2.4415674752923087
this is because the film badges do not include the contribution of the UNK parts of the body to effective dose .    2.835190035140258
from the estimated annual effective dose , a lifetime dose of 68 msv was estimated for a 40 - year working career .    1.9928822687178265
the corresponding lifetime risk for induced fatal cancer due to radiation exposure was determined to 0 . 3 % applying the UNK risk factor of 4 - 10 - 2 sv - 1 .    2.4287570767272317
considering the UNK recommendations for a safe occupation , working in a cardiac catheterization laboratory can be considered as safe when applying all radiation protection measures .    2.2621167720221425
however , changing the protection measures and modifying the parameters of the x - ray - tube can lead to strong changes of the radiation exposure and the resulting risk estimation .    2.7446273930157474
treatment of pulmonary hypertension is an important issue in intensive care .    3.0985636863746455
one therapeutic regimen involves the intravenous administration of prostacyclin ( pgi2 ) .    2.107292354022111
this , however , is accompanied by diminished hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction , reduced arterial oxygenation , and systemic vasodilation .    2.7651600175475624
thus , its clinical usefulness is limited .    2.556354399036308
however , the inhalation of vasodilators such as nitric oxide ( no ) or UNK pgi2 causes a selective pulmonary vasodilation in ventilated alveoli and improved gas exchange , without any systemic vasodilation .    1.9961054250750876
it has therefore gained importance for the treatment of pulmonary failure associated with high shunt fractions .    2.9853482904836968
however , the inhalation of vasodilators may have adverse effects : in the case of no , toxic side effects are predominant ( UNK , UNK ) , whereas in the case of pgi2 , technical problems in terms of dosing and administration safety are of major interest .    2.8277768710407396
furthermore , some patients do not respond to the treatment .    2.725337573360233
in some individuals a reduction in pulmonary hypertension can be seen , while others lack even pulmonary vasodilation .    2.425146640255332
the exact pathophysiological mechanisms remain to be investigated .    2.623313149404685
the treatment of infrarenal aortic aneurysms by means of UNK placed endovascular prostheses reflects significant progress in the field of vascular surgery .    2.6377238447249822
in the case of infrarenal aortic aneurysm it is possible to achieve technically successful implantation of such a prosthesis in well over 90 % of cases .    2.551540035478913
the rate of clinical success , meaning lasting effective exclusion of the aortic aneurysm , cannot ( yet ) be definitively determined , since no long - term results are so far available .    2.301124867901451
further development of endovascular prostheses will include optimization of the aortal / iliac attachment of the prostheses , a better configuration and the development of long - lasting materials that can be used for endovascular prostheses .    2.7870874017003864
the frequency of postspinal headaches after accidental puncture of the subarachnoid space with 16 - 18 g UNK needles is reported at 59 - 85 % .    1.9674875148982371
a case of postspinal headache syndrome persisting over a period of 6 weeks following epidural anaesthesia during labour is described .    2.2568843049689327
a 30 - year - old women had severe postspinal headache for 6 weeks after epidural anaesthesia during labour .    2.574268958151843
conservative therapy for 3 days and 4 days of bedrest followed by UNK infusions during a 3 - week hospital stay and a subsequent 3 - week period of bedrest at home did not lead to lasting pain relief .    2.315804330785864
intracranial haematoma and other abnormal processes were excluded by cct .    2.260583007124846
a lumbar epidural blood patch of 15 ml of autologous blood was performed at l3 / 4 .    2.6287737198839682
the patient stayed in bed for 12 h . after 3 h free of pain the patient complained of recurring headache .    2.235256135862061
after a further 48 h of bedrest she had recovered .    2.357284804810727
because of lumbar pain 4 days after the epidural blood patch a mrt was performed , which showed the blood at l4 to s3 in the epidural space .    2.3779732801157345
such possible treatments as diminishing subarachnoidal pressure by bedrest , increasing cerebrospinal fluid production by infusions , increasing epidural pressure by epidural infusions and closing the cerebrospinal fluid leakage by epidural blood patch are discussed .    1.8328551758658072
the average success rate with the epidural blood patch is 93 % .    2.399575441099833
volumes ranging from 5 to 20 ml are discussed for the autologous blood .    2.3262255298726786
we chose 15 ml of blood , to take account of the possibility that blood might UNK in the wide sacral space .    2.7360340936536796
we were able to document the position of the blood patch as l4 to s3 on mr tomography ( the injection site was l3 / 4 ) .    2.4233269040380794
most patients are free of headache 1 h after epidural blood patch .    2.606493210411706
our patient had to be confined to bed for another 48 h because of recurring headache .    2.497787917487144
the blood patch alone was not immediately sufficient to prevent all further cerebrospinal fluid leakage .    2.237553462756093
probably more than one subarachnoidal puncture had been made during the difficult epidural anesthetic procedure .    2.3615722290491266
the combination of the large - volume blood patch , which diminished the leakage , and conservative treatment , which narrowed the UNK pressure difference , was successful : the 6 - week postspinal headache was cured .    2.113799337279667
prolonged postspinal headache should be treated by epidural blood patch .    2.8426395909797453
the use of over 10 ml cannot be generally recommended , although in this case most of the blood patch of 15 ml was localized UNK .    2.7563667570577315
careful monitoring for side effects is necessary with blood volumes larger than 10 ml .    2.1740415410738465
if there is no immediate relief , conservative therapy with 24 - 48 h of bedrest is recommended .    2.4022402848343205
if the headache persists a second blood patch should be performed , with the volume and the probable caudal spreading of the first taken into account .    2.675776987544209
the aim of the present study was to assess the effects of carvedilol therapy in addition to conventional heart failure therapy on heart rate variability ( hrv ) and on left ventricular function in 14 patients with mild to moderate heart failure due to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( idc ) .    2.375587790218554
after a 3 - to 4 - week titration period , carvedilol was titrated up to 50mg daily , or the highest dose tolerated ( at least UNK daily ) .    2.148966998411446
maintenance treatment was then continued for 8 weeks .    2.6369511328074795
hrv for the entire 24 - hour period was computed in the time domain using the oxford medilog excel 2 analysis system .    2.1424408830451593
measures of hrv included the mean of all coupling intervals between normal beats ( UNK ) , the standard deviation of all normal rr intervals ( sdnn ) , the square root of the mean of the squared differences between adjacent normal rr intervals ( rmssd ) , and the proportion of adjacent normal rr intervals differing > UNK ( UNK ) .    2.567254363698755
the histologic determination of the degree of tissue UNK and grade of malignancy of gliomas is based upon qualitative histological features ( nuclear UNK , mitoses , endothelial proliferation , tumor necrosis ) .    2.346801739926541
this grading approach is influenced by the subjective interpretation of the pathologist , especially concerning the weighting of criteria ( UNK , moderate , pronounced ) .    2.5368238114086834
an observer - independent approach seems to be feasible by UNK the concept of parameter weighting in favor of an UNK approach UNK only the presence or absence of these structure parameters .    2.564145386277733
this grading procedure is recognized in the revised who classification of brain tumors for common type astrocytomas ( UNK .    2.2031352869808836
UNK - mayo system , UNK ) .    2.719350217879458
our results indicate that a similiar approach is also suitable for grading purposes of oligodendrogliomas and mixed gliomas .    2.0469588125172415
our recent investigations on glioma grading showed , both for astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas , that a two - UNK grading scheme distinguishing only " low - grade " and " high - grade " cases was prognostically relevant .    2.2419367789597175
for all glioma entities the onset of tumor angiogenesis with endothelial proliferation and contrast enhancement in ct and mri seems to be the key criterion indicating irreversible tumor progression to the " high " malignancy grade .    2.428242397869675
in patients with severe angina pectoris due to coronary artery disease , who are not candidates for either percutaneous coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery , transmyocardial laser revascularization ( tmr ) often leads to improvement of clinical symptoms and increased exercise capacity .    2.3935144143040636
one UNK of tmr is the need for surgical thoracotomy in order to gain access to the epicardial UNK of the heart .    3.211810223334864
therefore , a catheter - based system has been developed , which allows creation of laser channels into the myocardium from the left ventricular cavity .    2.5999960042057784
several phase iii studies have proven that the beta - UNK have positive effects on the number and severity of acute exacerbations of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis .    2.3145943631868944
recently the first study on the effectiveness of interferon beta - 1b in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis was published .    2.570053125134275
in a multicenter , double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled study UNK patients with secondary progressive multiple sclerosis and an expanded disability status scale ( edss ) value between 3 . 0 and 6 . 5 were treated with either 8 UNK .    2.4103627916745602
the primary study end - point was the time until confirmed progression of the disease as UNK by a one point increase of the edss value ( for initial edss values between 3 . 0 and 5 . 5 ) or 0 . 5 point increase when the initial edss value was between 6 . 0 and 6 . 5 .    2.669023808598627
after two years an interim analysis showed a highly significant difference in delay of disease progression by nine to twelve months for the treatment group ( p = 0 . 0008 ) .    2.408573652807152
this means that interferon beta - 1b is the first recombinant beta - interferon to be shown effective in the treatment of secondary progressive multiple sclerosis .    2.5586413402428634
to test the effect of UNK on UNK or UNK function .    3.9684504338955047
cases of female patients who UNK having been sexually abused by their fathers during ( early ) childhood and wish to explore and work on healing this trauma are being discussed .    1.8843282560589931
in this contribution an attempt is being made to understand these patients and to examine their psychodynamic background as well as the deeper meaning of their above mentioned UNK efforts .    2.2884324834642618
on the basis of these cases we can put the following psychodynamic hypotheses : 1 ) the incest - phantasy is a UNK attempt ; 2 ) the incest - phantasy is a symbolic representation ; 3 ) in the sense of a symbolic wish - UNK included in the parent - child - interaction .    2.276960577711589
hospitals and clinics for ambulant surgery shall identify and register certain officially defined nosocomial infections ( surveillance ) as well as the isolation of bacteria with special and important antimicrobial resistancies ( § 23 abs .    2.016618178460052
1 UNK = infection prevention act ) .    2.4232720211771412
the nosocomial infections to be recorded , i . e device associated infections and postsurgical UNK , have been selected on the basis of national and international experiences with the surveillance of nosocomial infections .    2.4643767114686232
important antimicrobial resistancies have been determined according to both the prevalence of the bacteria in nosocomial settings as well as their clinical and epidemiological importance .    2.6086330657702734
most of the relevant data may be provided by the clinical UNK laboratory but shall be collected , listed and discussed by the staff of wards or surgery clinics .    2.163803783810486
both types of documentation shall be used to identify and eradicate problems in hygiene management and to stop further distribution of difficult to treat bacteria like mrsa . they are part of the quality assurance management according to § 137 sgb v .    2.2325063163303764
nasopharyngeal carcinomas ( npc ) belong to the most frequent malignant tumours in certain parts of the world , e . g . , south - east asia , while they occur infrequently in western europe .    2.304262389443729
the association of npcs with epstein - barr virus ( ebv ) , a transforming human herpes virus , is well established .    2.2230860460790254
the current who classification UNK two major npc UNK , non - keratinising npc and squamous cell npc .    2.348490872007908
ebv is invariably present in non - keratinising npcs and the viral UNK lmp - 1 ( latent membrane protein - 1 ) is expressed in some cases .    2.6105698646348587
the tumour cells of non - keratinising npcs show phenotypic features which are inducible by lmp - 1 in vitro .    2.268953412367772
these may contribute to the development of the lymphoid stroma which is characteristic of this tumour type .    2.925712960761393
furthermore , the virus is detectable in nasopharyngeal carcinoma in situ .    2.1990440713855106
thus , the virus is likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of non - keratinising npcs .    3.2499521530218503
by contrast , the association of squamous cell npcs with ebv displays a geographical variability .    2.545413479680733
it appears , therefore , that squamous cell npcs are a heterogenous group of tumours distinct from non - keratinising npcs .    2.2966854786178534
to assess treatment outcome and prognostic factors following postoperative external radiotherapy in 77 patients with low - grade glioma .    2.320564760027969
between UNK and 1996 , 45 patients with astrocytoma , 14 with UNK and 18 with mixed glioma received postoperative radiotherapy with a median total dose of 52 gy ( range , 45 to 61 gy ) .    2.4376960661113416
sixty - seven patients were treated immediately following surgery , 10 patients with tumor progression .    3.137032798711023
the influence of various factors including histology , gender , age , seizures , duration of symptoms ( < = 6 weeks vs > 6 weeks ) , ct pattern ( enhancement vs no enhancement ) , type of surgery , total radiotherapy dose and timing of radiotherapy on relapse - free survival and overall survival was investigated .    2.1757847291816694
the median overall survival time was 81 month , the 5 - and 10 - year survival rates were 54 % and 31 % , respectively .    2.5725553774554397
the median time to progression was 56 months , while the 5 - and 10 - year progression - free survival rates were 45 % and 24 % .    2.39926721504799
univariate analyses identified the total radiotherapy dose ( p = 0 . 01 ) , duration of symptoms ( p = 0 . 05 ) , the presence of seizures ( p = 0 . 04 ) , and the ct pattern following intravenous contrast ( p = 0 . 005 ) as significant prognostic factors for overall survival .    2.936842626805591
progression - free survival rates were influenced by the total dose ( p = 0 . 04 ) , the duration of symptoms ( p = 0 . 01 ) and ct pattern ( p = 0 . 006 ) .    3.1642469551074712
on multivariate analysis , only the ct pattern ( enhancement vs no enhancement ) remained as independent prognostic factors for both progression - free survival and overall survival .    2.190318411731671
a minimum total dose of 52 gy is recommended for the postoperative radiotherapy in low - grade glioma .    2.748087837169217
tumors with ct enhancement seem to need further intensification of treatment .    2.194729814216356
we report three patients with severe guillain - barré syndrome ( gbs ) .    2.5234859159643293
on clinical examination , no sensory deficit was elicited .    2.6919450371076623
electromyography ( emg ) and motor nerve conduction velocity ( ncv ) studies were indicative of an axonal lesion .    2.0099903442548457
in two patients , we found total peripheral conduction block without UNK emg activity .    2.701334394967957
sensory ncv and cortical median nerve evoked potentials remained normal .    2.179160787769226
sural nerve biopsy revealed unequivocal alterations of sensory nerve fibers , some in the form of primary UNK .    2.205159378985642
therefore , these cases must UNK classified as combined motor - sensory syndromes despite the clinical and electrophysiological findings .    2.3201189649568765
although total denervation of the extremity muscles occurred , causing UNK , this manifestation appears to be attributable to the secondary axonal variant .    2.291369469370321
in contrast to positive reports in literature , immunomodulatory treatment proved ineffective in all three cases .    2.251246333809797
continuous spinal anaesthesia ( csa ) is a further means of central nerve block for anaesthesia besides single - shot spinal ( UNK ) , combined spinal / epidural , and epidural anaesthesia .    2.4282646447591736
do hepatitis c virus ( hcv ) infected food handlers represent a risk for the consumer ?    2.4864751978338293
epidemiological data on hcv transmission in our opinion do not provide a basis for excluding hcv positive individuals from working as food handlers in general .    2.1949588820829242
such restrictions seem to be justified only if hcv infected employees might infect their colleagues while performing occupational activities that are associated with a high risk of contracting percutaneous injuries and overt bleeding .    2.296012113124603
recently , good functional and anatomical results have been reported in treating full thickness macular holes .    2.5590861063839645
only a few studies describe a removal of a membrane at the vitreoretinal interface after having removal of the vitreous and its cortex .    2.4532545992127273
to demonstrate the beneficial effects of removing this membrane at the vitreoretinal interface we present our functional and anatomical results in this retrospective study .    2.5334171219409196
dementia - screening in clinical routine requires short , sensitive and specific tools .    2.505222663056024
a number of standardized instruments are available for this purpose .    3.133601003515807
the present study analysed the relationship between size of three examplary dementia - screening tests and their diagnostic accuracy .    2.2927076178898824
a UNK report requires that an exact diagnostic investigation of the peripheral vein system be carried out to assess both function and morphology .    2.4319883423399853
the most important , reproducible findings can be obtained using dynamic UNK and ascending pressure phlebography , as a second expert can directly reconstruct the process by which assessments have been made .    2.2199430395213104
additional quantification information can be obtained by measuring reflux using colour - coded duplex sonography .    2.406087040128192
a UNK condition should always be investigated in terms of UNK .    2.969383288224156
in patients with severe post - thrombotic disease , a chronic compartment syndrome of the posterior spaces should be reckoned with , and in such patients magnetic resonance imaging , computed tomography and , if possible , dynamic compartment manometry are additional suitable methods of examination .    2.6883719055432183
there is currently no generally valid UNK of the post - thrombotic syndrome on which to base an expert opinion .    2.5467323648094693
when evaluating patients , we largely follow our own new classification , which distinguishes four stages based on clinical tissue sclerosis .    2.1282347872248786
since systemic treatment of neuropathic plantar ulcers in diabetics ( dnpu ) has so far been rather ineffective , recent reports of successful management of dnpu by short - term retrograde transvenous leg UNK ( rvp ) by south american UNK encouraged us to apply this treatment method in diabetics suffering from chronic dnpu .    1.8481446714339835
hence , in a prospective comparative clinical trial started in 1989 we have treated 45 male diabetics suffering from dnpu with the same daily doses of netilmycin , administered either in systemic venous infusions ( svi : n = 21 , three times / day ) or in rvp ( n = 24 , once / day ) .    2.291926147918647
diminution of the ulcer area by > 30 % including full debridement was achieved in 10 / 24 of the rvp cases ( svi : 4 / 21 ) .    2.1099891454479804
during 6 months of follow - up , amputation of toes or forefoot was necessary in only 1 patient in the rvp group , but in 4 in the svi group .    2.549060122766301
partial restitution of osteolytic damage was observed in some cases after rvp .    2.874498097043572
our results show that regional netilmycin therapy given by the rvp procedure is clearly superior to equal netilmycin doses administered by svi for the treatment of dnpu .    2.205560109274707
rvp can be recommended in dnpu , particularly when the ulcers are complicated by infections .    2.446218177023555
the topics involved in this conflict cover a broad spectrum , ranging from in vitro fertilization with subsequent implantation of the embryo through the problems of multiple pregnancy and selective UNK , the many questions raised by assisted fertilization , and especially by anonymous sperm donation , and the controversial techniques of preimplantation diagnosis and cryopreservation , to the legal aspects of prenatal diagnosis , some of which have already been the subjects of cases decided in the supreme courts .    2.2529037243862384
against this backdrop objective discussion is all the more important , and the UNK in this paper , which necessarily touch on only some of the matters at issue , are intended to stimulate such discussion .    2.4499025235050595
in mr - imaging , similar to computed tomography , diagnosis of metastatic lymph - node disease is based on lymph - node sizes , and thereby it is non - specific .    2.7955695990120186
superparamagnetic iron oxide as a potential contrast medium for mr - lymphography accumulate in normal lymph node tissue after endolymphatic , interstitial and , in case of very small particles , after intravenous injection .    2.1616871468862175
no accumulation UNK in lymph node metastases .    2.8791735720210787
lymph - node metastases can be detected by all three injection techniques .    2.923357126167018
it has been shown experimentally , that in particular small metastases can be detected in normal sized lymph nodes .    2.4749000657198583
however , mr - lymphography also has inherent methodologic problems , as there may UNK an UNK distribution of the contrast medium between different lymph - node groups .    2.4288738429861723
the purpose of this study was to evaluate anatomical and functional results of vitreoretinal silicone oil surgery for complicated retinal UNK due to trauma and myopia in children and juveniles .    2.2213319854369535
in 1993 , we adopted conventional thoracic and abdominal prosthetic grafting and tailored aortoplasty ( tap ) of the thoraco - abdominal aortic segment iii / iv in chronic - expanding type b aortic dissection ( cead ) to achieve 2 primary goals : 1 . reduction of renal / visceral and spinal cord ischemic time ; 2 . safe and secure reperfusion of all critical aortic branches for prevention of major complications , i . e . paraplegia , kidney failure , and intestinal infarction .    1.9531507044210499
selection criteria are : 1 .    3.012073819142865
cead - > 5 cm 2 . expansion rate > = 5 mm / 6 months 3 . involvement of the critical aortic segment iii / iv .    2.079039841930053
tap consists of : 1 . left posterolateral UNK from th 8 - l 2 , 2 . excision of the intraaortic dissection membrane ( s ) 3 . aortic closure to a diameter of 3 cm to reduce wall tension .    2.1546730653712007
all 5 patients survived without any major complications , particularly no paraplegia .    2.4505371228861894
mean cross - clamping was 43 min .    2.5817474101857827
after 7 months , 1 patient was successfully repaired due to false aneurysm at the distal thoracic graft suture line .    2.1839729072654253
after mean follow - up of 2 . 4 years , ct - angiography revealed a stable tap segment ( mean aortic - 3 . 2 cm ) in 4 patients and one re - expanded tap segment ( from 4 cm after 24 months up to 7 cm ) without signs of re - dissection .    2.5558951764487547
our 4 - year - results ( 1 ) UNK the UNK UNK data .    4.217653596324479
although one re - expanded tap segment is UNK , we found the short - term gains so UNK to strongly advocate the tailored approach as a principle means of avoiding paraplegia in this extremely high risk group of patients .    2.221710808927355
all optically active molecules have at least one asymmetric UNK in common which is attached to four ligands , that can have different three dimensional positions .    2.0881158848109886
therefore it can be concluded that the resulting isomers are chemically identical in all respects except for the direction with which they rotate plane - polarized light .    2.1667686244481033
when the UNK and its corresponding UNK are present in equal proportions , they are called racemic mixture , a mixture that does not rotate polarized light , since the optical activities of the two isomers UNK each other .    2.4043171069906992
although the isomers are chemically identical other optically active molecules can interact with these isomers in a geometrically specific way termed UNK .    1.8985059416829573
the human body comprises a UNK environment due to optically active proteins ; thus it is not surprising that UNK drugs exhibit different pharmacological properties , when used as pure optical isomers .    2.191877978175398
till today most modern anaesthetics have been optical isomers , which are mainly used as racemic mixture ( 1 : 1 mixture ) .    2.296960885464995
for financial reasons pure isomers were only used for research purposes , but nowadays the wide clinical use of pure isomers is UNK feasible due to new production techniques .    2.045145656035527
the terms eutomer and distomer were chosen to indicate the more or less potent form of the drug .    2.475693716024086
the clinical use of pure isomers is only of advisable , if there are significant differences between eutomer and distomer in desired or side effects .    2.2621657880707513
among the modern anaesthetics ketamine , isoflurane , bupivacaine and atracurium exhibit an asymmetric carbon .    2.0245069350815217
for most drugs the separation in pure isomers will reduce side effects .    2.108320940620682
for volatile anaesthetics this question is still unanswered , since experimental and clinical results are inconsistent so far .    2.239578343047955
the high prevalence of aspirin intolerance in UNK and patients with nasal polyps as well as reports of familial UNK suggest a genetic disposition of this disease .    2.836592526467696
our study aimed at obtaining further evidence of hereditary factors in this disease .    2.286191166890766
we included 33 unselected patients from 28 families with aspirin intolerance and UNK in this study .    2.559157482719834
controls were recruited from individuals treated in our ent clinic for diseases other than aspirin intolerance ( n = 52 ) .    2.424490836981746
the application of a tryptophan - free amino acid mixture ( tryptophan depletion test ) induces a rapid and substantial lowering of both total and free plasma tryptophan .    2.037671131631039
consequently , the brain serotonin content and also cerebral serotonin function are decreased .    2.155735904553891
this method provides a paradigm to study the role of serotonin in the UNK of depressive disorders and their treatment modalities .    3.1065352429061694
untreated depressed patients show few behavioral effects during tryptophan depletion .    2.204896328471048
in depressed patients during an antidepressant or light - therapy - induced stable remission , a transient depressive relapse was induced by tryptophan depletion .    2.0891129734421034
these findings indicate the relevance of altered brain serotonin function in the pathophysiology of affective disorders and strengthen the importance of serotonin in the mechanism of action of antidepressants .    2.573227810154904
since recently published studies revealed some evidence that the serotonergic system is directly involved in the pathophysiology of various psychiatric syndromes besides depression , it seems to be reasonable to evaluate the validity of the tryptophan depletion test also in non - depressed patients .    2.530155659479163
they may UNK fm by ( 1 ) the occurance of wide spread pain , ( 2 ) the chronicity of complaints , ( 3 ) the preponderance of females in some of these , and ( 4 ) the lack of objective data to be derived from imaging techniques and laboratory tests .    2.6129066359353565
pain is produced by the disturbance of normal function ( " dysfunctional syndromes " , UNK , UNK .    3.051001154578183
recognition requires examination of the locomotor system under biomechanical auspices both at rest and during movement in order to diagnose hyper - and UNK syndromes ; treatment of these conditions is guided by principles to improve biomechanical function .    2.559661380782147
in addition , the skin needs to be examined to detect UNK ( also called " cellulitis " ) , which may be mixed up with fm due to its preferential occurance in peri - or postmenopausal women .    2.439540045828432
it is concluded that the UNK differential diagnosis needs to be considered appropriately in coinciding fm and all studies dealing with fm .    2.4338404623365717
in a prospective , randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia ( ldl cholesterol > = 130 < = UNK / dl ) , we compared the effect of an early - initiated , intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events .    2.6299968009846544
patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and / or ptca because of severe / instable angina pectoris .    2.753622163982734
the intensified therapy consisted of UNK 20 - UNK with addition of UNK and / or nicotinic acid , if necessary , to achieve an ldl cholesterol < = UNK / dl .    2.7756861456913877
in the control group , antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician .    2.5534105661475857
multiple sclerosis is a rare disease in childhood .    3.0910024836152634
a 10 1 / 2 year old girl developed a rapidly ongoing paresis of the right leg accompanied by paresthesia , sphincter incompetence and retrobulbar neuritis .    2.3203621989109013
abrupt vessel closure of the dilated vessel continues to represent a significant limitation of coronary angioplasty .    2.5138586561081304
despite increasing operator experience and improved technology , abrupt vessel closure continues to represent the most important complication of balloon angioplasty .    2.4194476702567043
intracoronary stent implantation and pharmaceutical blockade of the gp iib / iiia receptor serve as effective tools in the prevention of abrupt vessel closure without completely resolving this problem .    2.119934816039617
about 50 % of patients presenting with abrupt vessel closure exhibit additional complications including myocardial infarction , necessity of cabg or death occurring in up to 10 % of acute occlusions .    2.6349028458830133
the purpose of this study is to evaluate if quantitative coronary angiography and assessment of clinical and laboratory data allows risk stratification concerning the probability of abrupt vessel closure .    2.554282077396924
ptca in the setting of acute coronary syndrome is associated with a markedly increased risk of abrupt vessel closure , indicating that different risk factors may contribute to the development of abrupt vessel closure in patients presenting with stable angina or acute coronary insufficiency syndromes .    2.744596824031746
since the skin dose becomes the limiting factor while deciding the UNK dose , the detailed analysis of dose distribution in the build - up region is necessary for high - energy photon beams .    2.176314455057558
in this study the beam UNK affecting the build - up and skin dose for 6 - and 18 - mv photons are analyzed .    2.211626036617797
measurements were made with 6 - and 18 - mv photons using a UNK parallel - plate ionization chamber ( UNK - 036 ) and a UNK - UNK UNK .    2.88318140748434
build - up ionization measurements were made with the chamber fitted into a 25 x 25 x 25 cm UNK phantom with a fixed ssd of 100 cm .    2.0386980752211756
the entrance and buildup dose measurements were made with a polycarbonate and a mesh type metallic shielding tray and a 45 ° wedge .    1.9430737199819492
exit dose measurements were carried out for the graphite patient supporting assembly table top , 1 . 0 cm thick piece of wood and the 1 . 0 cm thick patient supporting perspex base frame for head and neck treatments .    2.2445191916873792
it was observed that the UNK decreased slightly with field size as with other accelerators .    2.4293465032406014
for both photon energies the surface dose was observed to increase with increase in field size .    2.3210273190132154
it was also noticed that the dose in the build - up region increases slightly when the polycarbonate secondary blocking tray is introduced with the increase in surface dose .    2.1191486277103104
the data show that the tray UNK factor ( tpf ) at surface decreases steadily with tray - surface distance for both photon beams for all field sizes .    1.9895270467653123
it was noted that the tpf was more when the polycarbonate tray was introduced at shorter tray - surface distances for both energies .    1.937288448629002
at tray - surface distances above 60 cm the tpf almost remained close to unity for 6 - mv photons for all field sizes , whereas the continuous decrease in tpf could be noted for 18 - mv photon beams even after the tpf UNK unity .    1.9797990557968246
the increase in surface dose with field size for both photon energies is due to the electron UNK from the UNK materials .    2.7466255548598455
the use of wedge filters UNK low - energy scattered electrons UNK and hence , the relative surface dose ( rsd ) is always less than unity .    2.1005963621827455
the increase in dose enhancement percentage with graphite compared to perspex supporting assembly indicates that the electron backscatter is proportional to the atomic number of the medium .    1.928928869410871
we investigated the nutritional value of a very low fat diet ( diet i ) adapted to nutritional habits in germany .    2.279007364338222
data were compared to a low fat diet ( diet ii ) according to the american heart association .    2.854906084581117
the study was performed in 37 patients with coronary heart disease ( 30 males and 7 females , age 45 - 83 yrs ) stratified to the 2 dietary treatments .    2.4953907028694053
daily fat intake was UNK ( 24 % of energy intake of 6 . UNK / d ) in diet i and 60g ( 31 % of 7 . UNK / d ) in diet ii ( p < 0 . 01 ) , respectively .    2.396956291229006
when compared with UNK , in dieti the intake of cholesterol , saturated and UNK fatty acids , vit .    2.513884378500646
b12 were all reduced ( p < 0 . 01 ) , whereas the uptake of vit .    2.7405722754205457
c was increased p < 0 . 01 .    3.142136614752125
the intake of folic acid was low in both groups .    2.381465718978534
both diets resulted in a decrease in bmi , systolic and diastolic blood pressure , plasma cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels .    2.6304736101832282
concomitantly plasma triglycerides only decreased in response to dieti but hdl cholesterol levels remained unchanged .    2.109126974836738
reduction of bmi and cholesterol levels were dependent on baseline bmi and cholesterol concentrations , respectively .    2.1130687504174954
the cholesterol lowering effect of diet i is in part attributed to the weight lowering effect of the diet .    2.442520467540184
taking into account the nutritional habits in germany , very low fat diets seem to be adequate with respect to their nutritional value .    2.6895268591769885
both diets are effective in lowering body weight , plasma cholesterol and UNK levels without affecting hdl cholesterol .    2.1493518487772216
these effects are most pronounced in overweight and UNK patients .    2.5067175305569527
besides autopsy determined findings of a fibro - fatty replacement in the right ventricular myocardium , no assured clinical evidence of UNK right ventricular dysplasia - cardiomyopathy ( arvd ) exists yet .    2.1352081582308498
criteria for the clinical diagnosis of avrd were complied in 1994 by members of the isfc work group and the european association for cardiology .    2.5143825768601054
with the successive examination of a collective of 24 patients with a histologically determined diagnosis of arvd at the jean UNK hospital in UNK - UNK - UNK , france , the value of the complied criteria were checked .    2.9121811545091734
global or segmental dilatation of the right ventricle in the sense of major criteria could be proven in 20 patients ( 83 % ) using angiography or electrocardiography .    2.5706131282472375
four patients ( 16 % ) exhibited only minor criteria in the UNK UNK or right ventricular angiography in the form of segmental kinetic disturbances of the right ventricular .    3.009619927575905
in all patients , the typical UNK replacement in the right ventricular myocardium could be histologically determined .    2.8918252503845223
t - inversion in the right UNK leads were present in 17 patients ( 71 % ) .    2.9685704920317195
a late potential analysis using signal averaged ecg was only present in 8 patients with positive results in 4 cases ( 50 % ) in the sense of minor criteria .    2.738146949498416
left bundle branch block ventricular tachycardia , which was classified as a minor criterion , was observed in 23 patients ( 96 % ) ; only one patient died without proven arrhythmia from rapidly progressing heart failure .    2.669148029830168
a previous history of unexpected sudden death in family members as a minor criterion arose in 3 of 19 patients ( 15 % ) .    2.248245631404187
the complied task force criteria for the diagnosis of avrd led in all 24 cases to the diagnosis of the disease , whereby the value of a determined histological diagnosis was the gold standard .    3.033752393027893
without inclusion of histological data , the clinical diagnosis was determined in only 10 cases .    2.8616986548367898
the question remains whether with a simple division of findings into major and minor criteria a pure clinical diagnosis is possible .    2.0090188286176427
subungual keratoacanthomas ( ska ) differ in clinical presentation , biological behaviour and the therapy needed from keratoacanthomas in other localizations .    2.1434842795326086
against the backdrop of two personal observations and a review of the literature , the authors describe clinical and histological features and also the differential diagnosis and therapy and this rare benign neoplasm .    2.582125218019043
patients present with a rapidly growing , painful subungual mass , which causes destruction of the underlying bone and usually does not UNK spontaneously .    2.5380196591929667
histological differentiation from squamous cell carcinoma is essential as the prognosis and treatment are different .    2.770041646401024
ska is treated by local excision and curettage .    2.413613888704026
erosions of the underlying distal phalanx usually heal spontaneously .    2.720127248401871
however , persistent recurrences after subtotal excision often necessitate amputation of the distal phalanx .    2.2719344284825436
UNK and UNK are important mediators of inflammation .    3.1250827229727776
while UNK synthesis can be influenced by nsaids therapeutical approaches to the 5 - UNK pathway are rare .    2.66861016095113
UNK extracts of UNK UNK ( h15 , UNK UNK ) , known from traditional UNK medicine , decrease UNK synthesis in vitro .    2.920015029762304
case reports suggest a clinical role for that drug .    2.4183880491140877
methods : outpatients with active ra have been enrolled into a multicenter controlled trial .    2.057196987256396
patients received 9 tablets of active drug ( 3600 mg ) or placebo daily in addition to their previous therapy .    2.2922040339154677
doses of nsaids could be adjusted on demand .    2.416003708687443
efficacy parameters , UNK index for swelling and pain , esr , crp , pain on vas and nsaid dose were documented at baseline and 6 and 12 weeks after initiation .    2.044469432865467
mean values and UNK were calculated to compare the groups for significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation .    2.1113365613161488
results : a total of 78 patients were recruited in 4 centers , the data have been published in UNK .    2.7376380730413783
only 37 patients ( verum 18 , placebo 19 ) , enrolled in ratingen were available for UNK efficacy and safety analysis .    2.2277912995148803
all evaluations in these patients were performed by one investigator ( g . h . ) .    2.757170765869889
there was no subjective , clinical or laboratory parameter showing a significant or clinically relevant change from baseline or difference between both groups at any time point of observation .    1.8173942055812706
the mean nsaid dose reduction reached levels of 5 . 8 % ( h15 ) and 3 . 1 % ( placebo ) .    2.9534928673083876
one patient in each group showed a good response in all parameters but 4 patients in each group worsened .    2.5770498681249694
the others showed no alteration of their disease .    2.403909168763711
controlled studies including a greater patient population are necessary to confirm or reject our results .    2.4040616559746533
a 61 - year - old woman with depression developed recurring elevated itching erythematous lesions in light - exposed areas after taking st . john ' s wort - extract for three years .    1.8959437534576347
routine UNK did not reveal any relevant reactions and UNK testing was negative .    2.3869346780432754
using a systemic oral UNK test with st . john ' s wort , we were able to demonstrate a decrease of the med - uvb which was reversible after withdrawal of the medication .    2.199384339108117
due to its low solubility and the high maximum concentration delivered by the vaporizer sevoflurane is especially suitable for the performance of low flow anaesthetic techniques .    2.248600055292226
high flow phases for wash - in or wash - out of anaesthetic gases can be kept short , the difference between the volatile ' s concentration in the fresh gas and within the breathing system is comparatively small , and the time constants are short even during low flow anaesthesia .    2.318462808482572
the monitoring , required to sufficiently ensure the safety of the patients , corresponds to the current UNK technical safety standards .    2.663320995231129
as compound a may accumulate in the breathing system , sevoflurane should not be administered with fresh gas flows lower than 1 . 0 l / min , until the scientific discussion on nephrotoxicity of this substance in humans is solved .    2.3239680901815296
low flow anaesthesia guarantees a sufficient and continuous wash - out of trace gases .    2.3696434549738026
thoroughly the use of sevoflurane with dry soda lime must be avoided , as this volatile in an extreme UNK reaction is absorbed nearly totally and degraded to a considerable degree by dry carbon dioxide absorbent .    2.0751154514858188
the gaseous degradation products are UNK and possibly may be harmful to the patients .    2.5899023105821075
only by low flow anaesthesia the use of sevoflurane will gain an economically and UNK acceptable range of efficiency .    2.427162753294887
cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction .    2.6240240330547486
the typical delay from the onset of acute infarction to the development of cardiogenic shock and well defined risk factors allow for an early identification of patients at risk .    2.5501088424936826
immediate restoration of coronary artery patency by thrombolysis or ptca can prevent cardiogenic shock in a number of these patients .    2.588675702005592
patients presenting with frank cardiogenic shock should be approached with diagnostic UNK in an attempt to identify a treatable lesion .    2.233028322165634
several non - randomized studies suggest that ptca is superior to thrombolysis in patients with shock and ongoing ischemia .    2.80234789597273
however , aortic counterpulsation may enhance reperfusion rates achieved by thrombolytic therapy in patients with cardiogenic shock .    2.414818614877289
early surgery is required in patients with shock due to mechanical complications , such as acute mitral regurgitation or rupture of the ventricular septum .    3.053406032902234
ventricular assist devices can be used in selected patients with refractory shock as a bridge to cardiac transplantation .    2.6602765728421582
right atrial thrombi are rare , but potentially life - threatening complications of UNK UNK .    2.9608285593045025
we report on a 4 . 6 year old girl , presenting with signs of subacute valve malfunction ; in her cerebrospinal fluid UNK - negative staphylococcus could be cultured , and the cf protein was elevated .    2.3200013193026194
UNK echocardiography demonstrated a large thrombus on the distal part of the shunt .    2.6381132599776302
the thrombus UNK into the right ventricle during UNK .    2.852245124563572
the child underwent UNK and thrombectomy .    2.574440934715783
object of this review is to present the physiological principles , diagnostic techniques and therapeutic options that are related to modifications of oxygen delivery in sepsis .    2.5007867955156464
despite intense research activities in this area , many topics regarding oxygen transport and oxygen consumption in sepsis are still not clear .    2.203389533492698
until now , it was not shown , whether the increase of oxygen delivery to supranormal levels reduces mortality in septic patients .    2.5919334558111657
it is also unknown , which catecholamine and which infusion solution is suitable for the treatment of septic patients .    2.709155497207241
in future further research is necessary to solve the problems associated with sepsis therapy .    2.6506162479020294
the rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration is a quite involved procedure associated with many potential dangers .    2.4710173815925724
a new nasogastric balloon tube has been developed , which will prevent the reflux of gastric contents by blocking the cardia with a balloon .    2.1079257484638942
it was the aim of this initial study to assess the efficiency of the tube in animals , healthy volunteers and patients .    2.7886052941759534
with the approval of the animal ethics committee , a total of 16 anaesthetised pigs were used for the animal experiments .    2.6978103205869335
balloon occlusion of the cardia was performed in 10 pigs .    3.3497599648756613
six further pigs with an unblocked cardia served as controls .    2.193652228705903
vomiting and regurgitation was provoked in each animal using six different UNK while the gastro - oesophageal ( lower oesophageal ) sphincter and intragastric pressures were monitored and the lower oesophagus was continuously inspected using an endoscope .    1.8702344712617225
with local ethics committee approval and informed written consent , ( 1 ) repeated vomiting was provoked in 16 awake , healthy adult volunteers ( 10 females , 6 males , 29 + / - 4 years ) with a fluid - filled stomach in the presence and in the absence of balloon occlusion of the cardia , while intragastric pressure was monitored , and ( 2 ) 30 patients ( 21 - 89 years ) with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration scheduled for abdominal or traumatologic surgery received conventional induction of anesthesia after blocking of the cardia with the balloon .    2.3984183997634285
pigs ( n = 10 ) with a blocked cardia showed no UNK reflux during a total of 60 manipulations to provoke vomiting and regurgitation , while 28 of the 36 UNK manipulations induced reflux in pigs ( n = 6 ) with an unblocked cardia .    2.4884745418279692
among the healthy volunteers with a blocked cardia ( n = 16 ) , reflux of gastric contents was not observed during repeated attempts to stimulate vomiting .    2.361940350789858
after termination of the occlusion of the cardia , reflux was able to be induced by 14 of the 16 volunteers .    2.5729406073427032
in 30 patients with an increased risk of pulmonary aspiration the cardia was blocked and anaesthesia was induced using a mask and manual ventilation without UNK any problems .    2.3078564064676415
the average time from loss of consciousness to tracheal intubation was 164 + / - 8 s . conclusions .    2.5082015572271716
it is concluded from the present results , with further clinical studies pending , that the gastric balloon probe permits low - risk conventional induction sequence of anaesthesia in patients with an increased risk for pulmonary aspiration and that the device may also be safely used during the extubation phase .    2.536931056357763
the article explains the cognitive psychoanalytic theory of psychotherapy developed by UNK and discusses the theory in the field between psychoanalytic and cognitive - UNK theories and therapeutic techniques .    2.271697878256126
the basic assumption is : pathogenic beliefs that are based on traumatic childhood experiences prevent normal desirable goals .    2.1678720027074108
patients are UNK UNK to overcome pathogenic beliefs .    2.831813797618125
in psychotherapy , the patient works to UNK pathogenic beliefs by testing them in the relationship with the therapist .    2.5516835874727106
in this way patients achieve corrective emotional experiences .    2.3080997297920844
the theory is supported by numerous empirical studies .    2.5242524577607326
treatment with " nootropic drugs " of patients suffering from dementia is often described as arbitrary .    2.4574627950255223
to define the potential usefulness of nootropic drugs , effects and side effects , economic aspects in comparison to other treatment approaches were studied .    2.6538521881994295
a summary of literature published concerning these criteria underlines the efficacy of nootropics in improving the symptoms at the beginning and in UNK the progress of the disease .    2.456428196919616
the majority of substances does not lead to severe side effects .    2.584666454033206
there are not enough studies comparing the effects of the substances or on prophylactic effects .    2.59671661864286
delayed admission to care units leads to a UNK - ve cost effect of nootropics .    2.8998445443377
thus , also for economic reasons it seems advisable to treat patients with nootropics .    2.322820611539657
better effects are gained when nootropic treatment is combined with training and changing of the structure of the environment .    2.380124044323252
a proposal for a rational treatment with nootropics is derived from the data .    2.369276252346769
purpose : to evaluate the efficacy of high - dose gd - dtpa - UNK ( UNK , UNK ) as a contrast for magnetic resonance imaging of malignant bone tumors and the use of high - dose dynamic studies for predicting the response to preoperative chemotherapy .    3.4087551005024017
simulation has gained an important role in medical education and continuing education in the field of anaesthesia and emergency medicine .    2.82557694699751
this article gives background information on how full - scale simulators are applied in medical education as well as in continuing education for advanced anesthesia and scientific applications .    2.2028220155201526
acceptance of training seems enhanced by inclusion of the human factor aspect , since this has proven to be a major source for the development of critical situations in our specialty .    2.6667987949158913
furthermore , drawbacks of the simulators available and the current training availability in germany is described .    2.1315915398391034
we evaluated changes in brain tissue oxygen pressure ( ptio2 ) and global cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) during cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) with deep hypothermic circulatory arrest ( dhca ) in ten anesthetized new UNK white rabbits ( body weight 2 . 5 + / - 0 . 5 kg ) .    2.088881860998464
cbf [ hydrogen desaturation ( clearance ) - technique ) and ptio2 ( UNK - UNK ) right UNK cortex ] were determined .    2.3876755246433867
after median sternotomy , the animals were placed on cpb ( standard UNK pump , UNK , - UNK acid - base management , perfusion flow of 180 - 200 ml / kg / min , right atrial and aortic cannulation ) for induction of dhca by cooling to 15 °c rectal temperature ( 1 °c per minute ) .    2.1456144001907984
rewarming period was started after 60 minutes of circulatory arrest and the rabbits were weaned from cpb without the use of any inotropic or vasoactive support .    2.164429943715451
under baseline conditions , ptio2 was 38 + / - 5 mmhg and did not change significantly before dhca .    2.4175319748417463
during dhca the ptio2 decreased within 15 minutes to 14 + / - 5 mmhg , after 30 minutes to 5 + / - 1 mmhg and after 40 minutes to zero .    2.2660375243057485
neither the ptio2 nor cbf recovered fully following restoration of bypass flow and reperfusion : ptio2 ( 25 + / - 4 mmhg vs . baseline : 38 + / - 5 mmhg , p < 0 . 05 ) and cbf ( 43 + / - 8 vs . baseline : 68 + / - 11 ml / 100 g / min , p < 0 . 05 ) were significantly reduced .    2.3990528166719987
arterial and jugular - venous lactate levels increased after rewarming ( p < 0 . 05 ) and corresponded to the appearance of a anaerobic metabolism .    2.228004632847306
these data demonstrate significantly decreased levels of ptio2 ( brain tissue oxygenation ) and cbf ( oxygen supply ) during and after rewarming from dhca .    2.015959273104489
the induced impairment of recovery persists after rewarming and generates a temporary low - flow situation with delayed brain tissue UNK on the cellular / mitochondrial level .    2.2311646785353005
thus , a direct influence on brain functional recovery by the active cooling and rewarming process about the UNK during cpb , resulting in disturbed tissue blood redistribution , mitochondrial dysfunction and / or excessive cerebral oxygen consumption ( compensation of an oxygen UNK ) is a possible explanation .    2.269965296198962
while initially advocated primarily for UNK visualization ( e . g . , craniotomy ) , interventional mri rapidly evolved into roles in image - guided localization for needle - based procedures , minimally invasive neurosurgical procedures , and thermal ablation of cancer .    1.8818599324073852
in this UNK , mri pulse sequences and scanning methods serve one of four primary roles : ( 1 ) speed improvement , ( 2 ) device localization , ( 3 ) anatomy / lesion differentiation and ( 4 ) temperature sensitivity .    2.274985401789002
a 74 - years old patient is admitted to the hospital with a over a period of 4 years growing , scrotal , UNK tumor .    2.5996678726213585
all laboratory findings including the UNK are normal .    2.8609951179422333
the scrotal sonography shows a solid tumor , that is filled with vessels in the doppler sonography .    2.3262186692345495
the complete tumor resection with histological examination leads to the diagnosis of a scrotal leiomyoma .    2.9235321577435487
this rare , benign tumor is a differential diagnosis to UNK or non - UNK tumors .    3.1628352579921013
this review summarizes vascular tumours of skin and soft tissues that have been characterised in recent years .    2.45109367799942
although most of them are very rare , knowledge about their reproducible clinicopathological features is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls .    2.6942221573328604
these lesions include : UNK angiomatosis , a UNK , UNK infection of immunocompromised patients caused by UNK UNK ; tufted angioma , a variant of lobular capillary haemangioma characterised by a " UNK - ball " distribution of multiple UNK composed of packed capillaries and UNK ; UNK haemangioma , a cutaneous haemangioma composed of thin - walled and irregularly branching blood vessels which dissect dermal collagen ; UNK haemangioma , a distinctive variant of cavernous haemangioma which may be located in the subcutaneous breast tissue and then may be confused with well - differentiated angiosarcoma ; " hobnail haemangioma " ( targetoid UNK haemangioma ) , a benign vascular tumour with a distinctive clinical targetoid appearance and a hobnail UNK of the prominent endothelial tumour cells ; retiform haemangioendothelioma , a very recently characterised low - grade angiosarcoma occurring most commonly in the extremities of adolescents which is characterised by UNK blood vessels arranged in a retiform pattern and lined by hobnail - like prominent endothelial cells ; kaposi - like infantile haemangioendothelioma , a borderline malignant tumour of infants mimicking kaposi ' s sarcoma histologically ; epithelioid angiosarcoma , a highly aggressive tumour in the spectrum of epithelioid vascular lesions which stains positively for endothelial and epithelial immunohistological markers ; benign lymph - UNK ( progressive UNK ) , a benign , slowly growing macule or plaque which has to be distinguished from well - differentiated angiosarcoma and kaposi ' s sarcoma ; and UNK of the limbs , a poorly recognised angiomatosis occurring in young patients and limited mainly to the limbs with a favourable prognosis .    2.0467572769402333
cardial features of the UNK syndrome of UNK ( ocrl ) are congenital cataract , mental retardation , hypotonia and renal tubular dysfunction .    2.887161082897995
the primary biochemical defect remains unknown .    2.466745997260622
an inborn error of the UNK phosphate metabolism as a result of mutations within the ocrl gene localized on the x - chromosome is discussed .    2.6191139571493607
experimental animal models of ventricular arrhythmias have been developed to investigate the mechanisms of UNK in man .    3.6510255562418745
ventricular arrhythmias associated with ischaemia and infarction often cannot be elucidated by clinical studies on patients because those arrhythmias are potentially lifethreatening and their occurrence is unpredictable .    2.0415992885395027
because of additional experimental procedures and techniques that can be used in the animal laboratory , such as UNK recording of transmembrane action potentials and high - density optical and electrical activation mapping , animal models have provided information that cannot be obtained from clinical studies .    2.5067890676797426
studies on animal models have provided new ideas and hypotheses that have been tested in clinical studies and that have been found to be true for clinical arrhythmias .    2.665921446800333
animal models have enabled the mechanisms of fibrillation and defibrillation to be understood and new therapeutic concepts to be developed .    2.3726822986041403
the purpose of this article is to briefly review some animal models of ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation .    2.2121878187883564
some contributions that these animal studies have made to our understanding of ventricular tachyarrhythmias will be discussed .    2.3613677865200917
because of the clinical importance of coronary artery disease this article concentrates on those arrhythmias caused by myocardial ischaemia and infarction .    2.6581150860711285
the authors report a rare , recently diagnosed and atypical UNK during one - lung ventilation ( olv ) via a double lumen tube ( dlt ) and left - sided thoracotomy : an ipsilateral pneumothorax during ventilation of the right lung .    2.216617161103941
anaesthesia and surgery were uneventful until aortic cross - clamping release .    2.3998224035358726
the common presentation of increased intrathoracic UNK pressure owing to a pneumothorax in patients with mechanically ventilated lungs is a rapid decrease in oxygen saturation , followed or paralleled by haemodynamic deterioration .    2.1498436860156387
although the above presentation could be seen in this case , the diagnosis of a tension pneumothorax was delayed twice .    3.2189785754003313
first , symptoms were initially obscured by haemodynamic changes resulting from a head - down tilt and aortic declamping .    2.117496419966529
second , since the lack of consolidation after aortic declamping focused attention on the airway problems , complications resulting from the use of a dlt were primarily considered .    2.5157562867979317
in particular , since breathing sounds were detectable initially , malposition or torsion of the dlt had to be excluded by fibre - optic bronchoscopy , which involved a further delay .    2.020173254416093
finally , two observations led to the diagnosis of a right - sided tension pneumothorax : ( 1 ) bullae of the contralateral lung , detected during thoracotomy ; ( 2 ) the finding that ventilation of both lungs and the left lung subsequently increased arterial ( sao2 ) and mixed venous oxygen saturation ( UNK ) and the circulatory status , but ventilation of the right lung caused a deterioration .    2.530132400722738
chest radiography and insertion of a chest tube with drainage of air , thereafter , validated our hypothesis .    2.169829396934795
the time course of oxygen desaturation during olv and tension pneumothorax was as severe as expected ; the time course of haemodynamic deterioration , however , appeared quicker and had more impact than expected .    2.3001484188441266
assuming that mediastinal deviation was not hindered by contralateral intrathoracic pressure during thoracotomy , we believed that circulation should be depressed later or to a lesser extent in patients with an intraoperative pneumothorax .    2.2545199870145787
yet , during thoracotomy , decrease in cardiac filling and output during tension pneumothorax in olv obviously results primarily from the UNK of the mediastinum owing to mediastinal fixation and is at least as decisive as the contralateral intrathoracic pressure in closed - chest patients .    2.2089201722636544
in summary , a tension pneumothorax during one - lung ventilation and thoracotomy is a rare , but disastrous complication during the use of a dlt , which has not , to our knowledge , been reported previously .    2.514564516464479
we recommend that tension pneumothorax be added to the list of complications and problems during olv by the use of a dlt , especially in patients with structural lung diseases .    2.8304691848730825
the intramedullary hip screw system classic - nail and the dynamic hip screw ( dhs ) were evaluated in a prospective - randomized clinical trial for operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures .    2.387764299888578
hundred and ten geriatric patients ( mean age 82 years ) were UNK included in the study ( 56 classic nail , 54 dhs ) .    2.6567190394815388
no significant differences between the two study groups were observed with regard to treatment and follow - up data .    3.2087719351727024
with the classic - nail one complete femur shaft fracture and one incomplete fracture occured at the tip of the nail intraoperatively and could successfully be fixed with cerclage wires .    1.969276600718951
in the dhs group two patients underwent reoperation for significant loss of reduction early postoperatively .    2.088606857913042
at an UNK follow - up of 3 . 7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups .    2.8934394523585567
- classic nail and dhs both lead to equally good results in the operative treatment of trochanteric femur fractures .    2.3701184821046675
the internal fixation of fractures of shaft bones was spread out by a group of surgeons working together with UNK .    2.5827239253750034
the principle of this method is a three point load carrying ( entry point , height of fracture and cancellous bone of the metaphysis of the opposite fracture part ) .    2.2329454924862713
from 1996 to 1999 86 children with fractures of the humerus , the fore - arm and the femur were operated in the technique of intramedullary nailing .    2.4240365673826774
the fractures affected the humerus to 3 . 5 % , the fore - arm to 65 . 1 % and the femoral shaft to 31 . 4 % .    3.0434956869250094
the UNK duration of stay in hospital after internal fixation of the fore - arm in the proximal and middle third lasted 7 . 2 days , the duration of immobilisation in a cast took 13 . 7 days .    2.4716263203416533
96 % of the patients showed very good and good results after operation .    3.2515440689801443
the average stay in hospital for patients with femoral shaft fractures was 14 . 4 days .    2.8002415354556107
17 weeks after operation the intramedullary nails were removed .    2.5974608586550523
at the time of first full weight bearing the legs showed an average shortening of 1 . 2 cm .    2.756870257715216
the fractures of the humerus healed without any restriction of movements .    2.8301903545147984
internal fixation is a minimal invasive operation technique with low risks and small operating trauma .    2.49303383700071
due to the stability a early mobilisation is possible .    2.4567225347534496
the only problem can be caused by too long nails irritating the skin .    2.375804839723835
objectives relief of pain in therapy - resistant lateral UNK through denervation and indirect decompression of the deep branch of the radial nerve through detachment of the UNK muscle only .    2.6101878511652816
physiology and age dependant changes of human bone marrow are described .    2.30471085895472
the resulting normal distribution patterns of active and inactive bone marrow including the various UNK on different mr - sequences are discussed .    2.1133447811814663
this report is based upon experience with UNK implantations of UNK UNK spacer between 1978 and 1992 .    2.4542352354653043
the results of 430 cases were followed up in 1995 .    2.6277463520714193
complications were observed in 31 cases and required further surgery .    2.833675868602244
in 18 cases , the spacer was resected ; in 2 cases a distal amputation was necessary .    2.6046265535789246
due to pain , the spacer was changed in 11 cases , in 5 cases from a single - stem to a double - stem version .    2.756532412294353
radiological reactions increase over time following the operation without correlation to pain .    2.280113242266649
the results in cases of rheumatoid arthritis and arthrosis disease are compared .    3.1281279760074914
approximately 80 % of the patients are free of pain and more than 90 % are satisfied with the functional results .    3.4230937590151043
the results of the arthrosis group are slightly better .    2.341685034220822
introduction : the goal of this study was to compare contrast - enhanced t1 - weighted flash and turbo - flash sequences with conventional spin - echo sequences as a basis for planning high - precision radiotherapy .    2.197035712757328
methods : a total of 25 consecutive patients with different intracranial tumors and a UNK blood - brain barrier were studied .    2.7680724786192323
t1 - weighted flash , turbo - flash and conventional spin - echo images were evaluated after controlled 30 - s infusion of 0 . 1 mmol / kg body weight of gd - dtpa .    2.284504783518102
the evaluation of the three sequences included the measurement of the signal - and contrast - to - noise ratios , the visual inspection of the tumors and artifacts , and the measurement of tumor size .    2.9747199929715475
results : the signal - and contrast - to - noise ratios were significantly ( p < 0 . 05 - 0 . 01 ) lower for flash and turbo - flash than for conventional spin - echo sequences .    2.324605557151593
however , visual inspection of the contrast - enhancing tumors revealed in 23 and 24 of 25 lesions on flash and UNK - UNK - flash images , respectively , good or very good tumor UNK when compared with conventional spin - echo images with a reduction of imaging time by a factor of 7 - 8 .    2.508944937917411
flash and turbo - flash sequences were more prone to susceptibility artifacts , conventional spin - echo sequences more to UNK artifacts in the posterior fossa .    2.0501317231096827
tumor sizes were comparable in all three techniques .    2.870877952816787
conclusion : at present , conventional spin - echo images are superior to fast flash and ultrafast turbo - flash sequences as a basis for accurate target volume definition in high - precision radiotherapy .    2.1084885589908544
however , fast flash and turbo - flash images may be a practicable alternative to conventional spin - echo images for tumors in the posterior fossa or in patients unable to tolerate a stereotactic fixation device .    2.184972335220573
despite some limitations , turbo - flash sequences enable fast dynamic mr imaging combined with an acceptable morphology , which may be sufficient for target volume planning in high - precision radiotherapy .    2.210915714076899
cystic tumors of the neck are usually cysts , UNK masses , lymph nodes , benign and malignant tumors or metastases .    2.8897022628606117
ectopic salivary tissue is a rather rare but clinically important malformation .    2.568961153776772
accessory and aberrant tissue can be identified histologically .    2.629832757073596
there may be an association with lymphatic tissue .    2.7361726940937734
we report on two patients who underwent surgical treatment under the tentative diagnosis of epidermal cysts which histologically turned out to be ectopic parotid tissue .    2.1614948734248633
nucleotides are low molecular weight biological compounds that play major roles in almost all - biological processes .    2.1848454707600817
cell nucleic acids and nucleotides are continuously UNK , degraded and salvaged .    2.0824488893223227
the body ' s pools derive from three potential sources : synthesis de novo , salvage ( UNK of preformed bases ) and the diet .    2.105331139305144
it is generally accepted that de novo synthesis of both purines and pyrimidines from amino acid precursors is capable of supporting the cellular needs for nucleic acid synthesis .    1.787757107193016
when protein intake is decreased or in situations in which there are a high demand of nucleotides synthesis ( after gut injury , after surgical trauma , sepsis , rapid growth : pregnancy or newborn infants , etc . )    2.010315297098924
some tissues with a rapid turnover ( gut and immune system ) may increase the salvage of exogenous nucleotides coming from the diet .    2.023796216053337
therefore , nucleotides may become UNK essential nutrients .    2.296653379665226
this article discusses the possible beneficial effects of dietary nucleotides on small intestine ( maturation and recovery ) and gut microflora , lipid and hepatic metabolism and on the immune system .    2.1616128072105085
human milk is the best source of nucleotides for young infants and the nucleotide / nucleoside profile of it shows a substantial predominance for pyrimidines as compared to purines .    2.205493655056792
moreover , pyrimidine nucleotides seem to be better preserved in breast milk during storage in the breast and during digestion in the small intestine and they are more absorbed and incorporated into tissue rna , as compared to purine ones .    2.1521937440157726
additional research should be done to improve the design of nucleotides supplemented infant formulas .    2.7740407303284407
this includes : 1 ) to investigate in vivo if the incorporation of dietary nucleotides in tissue rna is enhanced in situations of stress or rapid growth and 2 ) to study the biological effects of individually administered purine and pyrimidine nucleotides .    2.211055689747038
parkinson ' s disease ( pd ) causes significant expense for the national health care system due to its chronic progressive course , the duration of the disease , the high prevalence and the devastating prognosis .    2.7998372742922153
in germany more than dm UNK million are spent for drugs to alleviate parkinsonian symptoms .    1.966465707125486
the aim of this study was to calculate the economic burden of pd by assessing direct medical costs .    1.9944246402728771
forty patients suffering from idiopathic pd were interviewed at an office of neurological specialists and at an outpatient movement disorder clinic about their use of health care resources 3 months prior to the study .    2.2623724653885526
the total annual costs reported were dm 14 , 500 , consisting of dm UNK for drug therapy and dm 8000 for other medical services , including hospital inpatient care ( dm UNK ) , outpatient care ( dm 700 ) , medical UNK ( dm 1100 ) and physiotherapy ( dm 600 ) .    1.9642680425439616
the costs were positively correlated to the extent of the disease ( UNK and UNK stage ; UNK ) and the occurrence of motor fluctuations / dyskinesias . we found that both drug - therapy expenses and total medical costs UNK from UNK to UNK .    2.9896880889938844
the rarely employed s . c . therapy with apomorphine additionally increased the costs of drug therapy in UNK .    2.282805397407828
the occurrence of fluctuations / dyskinesias also increased medical expenses by approximately a factor of two .    2.080668272555312
indirect burden due to increased days off of work , unemployment and earlier retirement are also significant in parkinson ' s disease .    1.977326155127215
this study UNK that a treatment which could prevent or retard disease progression as well as a treatment that delays or reduces motor complications would not only UNK the situation of patients suffering from pd , but would also lead to significant reductions in cost for the national health care system .    2.212378433154326
after having been frozen and subsequently UNK , the tissue can , ideally , be transplanted to its original site , where it leads to spontaneous fertilisation .    2.2237548449422033
heterotopic transplantations are also discussed as autografts or UNK in UNK mice .    2.5912167041929806
in addition to the use of whole tissue , the isolation of individual follicles and their in vitro maturation ( ivm ) are discussed .    2.3975897271138673
as in the case of heterotopic transplantation of ovarian tissue , pregnancy can only be achieved in these cases by in vitro fertilisation of the UNK oocytes .    3.277970451008701
although considerable progress has already been made in both directions , these are still , at the present time , experimental processes that require further in - depth investigation prior to widespread clinical application .    2.0949004244516756
in addition to its use following the cryopreservation of ovarian tissue , ivm of immature oocytes also plays a significant role in promoting current methods of assisted reproduction .    2.0374271870257337
the successful maturation of immature oocytes could lead to improved assessment of the oocytes obtained by follicular puncture and to a reduction in the incidence and risk of ovarian stimulation .    2.711115053938068
ivm is therefore expected to broaden the spectrum of individual treatment regimens as in the case of UNK patients , for instance , increasing treatment efficacy by the additional acquisition of immature oocytes or by " UNK " ivf cycles with unintentionally immature oocytes .    2.5137204006502536
background : UNK peribulbar anesthesia is reported to permit better identification of the bulbar limits because of a better view into the UNK ; it is also said to be less painful compared to transcutaneous peribulbar anesthesia .    2.5310748598849164
the aim of our study was to compare the two injection techniques .    2.298379146415997
the german registry for hearing loss in children ( dzh ) processes nationwide data from audiological centers .    1.960434013217308
coping with the UNK data and its subsequent management and analysis requires a high degree of security and control .    2.8171889522776867
to establish a nationwide registry it is necessary at an early stage to take into consideration the legal requirements of the participating states .    2.520953957679835
use of the dzh as an example demonstrates how a pragmatic solution can be reached .    2.656205166303224
special issues concerning data collection , transfer , storage and deletion , coding strategies to ensure UNK , checking for UNK UNK , data separation , and automated data analysis and data protection are explained .    2.0492508098502946
cardiac fibroblasts are known to have high affinity corticoid receptors for aldosterone and account for the accumulation of collagen within the interstitium of the rat myocardium in acquired and genetic hypertension .    2.0549133445925083
this interstitial fibrosis is an important determinant of pathologic hypertrophy in chronic heart failure .    2.4849787975920963
the social environment in which obstetrics is offered today is characterized by a UNK of weariness : weariness by UNK , UNK and by misunderstanding .    2.8922356973215244
as a final result an unscientific era comes about , on which karl UNK UNK in 1945 that only this unscientific spirit had made national UNK possible .    1.9347794445936377
based on the good statistical results of german obstetrics compared to those of foreign countries , it is shown that our patients ' demands for " gentle " obstetrics can be combined with the requirements of safe obstetrics .    2.4397467644255846
if the professional interests of doctors and midwives are joint together , " safe and gentle " obstetrics should result in the common goal of a healthy child and a happy mother .    1.9795695037736705
objectives : due to its unique pharmacokinetics , the new esterase - UNK opioid remifentanil results in rapid post - anaesthesia recovery .    2.106911834520719
the aim of this clinical investigation was to compare recovery times after remifentanil anaesthesia in combination with hypnotic concentrations of either propofol or isoflurane .    2.353714357204861
dosages used in the study protocol were based on recommendations by the pharmaceutical manufacturer .    2.922126063506009
methods : patients ( asa status i - ii ) scheduled for elective arthroscopy were included in this trial .    2.3397874851627476
for maintenance of anaesthesia remifentanil ( 0 . 25 µg / kg / min ) was combined with either a propofol infusion of 0 . 1 mg / kg / min or 0 . 5 mac isoflurane ( = 0 . 6 vol . % ) in o2 / air .    2.9367190376692456
anaesthetic delivery was discontinued simultaneously with termination of surgery and recovery times were recorded .    2.4051118299640915
results : a total of 40 patients were studied at random in two groups of 20 each with comparable demographic data and anaesthetic technique ( tables 1 and 2 ) .    2.291537100886337
in both groups emergence was very rapid .    2.670663584875653
recovery times were significantly shorter for remifentanil - isoflurane than for remifentanil - propofol ( table 3 ) : spontaneous ventilation 5 . 1 vs 8 . 1 min ( p < 0 . 05 ) , extubation 5 . 5 vs . 8 . 6 min ( p < 0 . 02 ) , post - anaesthesia recovery score > = 9 of 10 points 6 . 2 vs 11 . 3 min ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and arrival at UNK 16 . 2 vs 19 . 2 min ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.352975834424716
mild to moderate UNK was noted in 40 % of all patients ( 9 cases following isoflurane , 7 following propofol ) .    2.6768821310598887
conclusions : using the manufacturer ' s recommended dosages , emergence after remifentanil anaesthesia is more rapid with 0 . 5 mac isoflurane than with 0 . 1 mg / kg / min propofol .    2.421773444393452
these results are most probably due to the different pharmacological properties of both co - anaesthetics , especially the applied dosages , and to different interactions with remifentanil .    2.6461396009243745
present clinical experience suggests that a further dose reduction , especially for propofol , is possible .    2.4884680507084
for both remifentanil groups emergence was remarkably rapid between return of consciousness and the awake state ( on - off phenomenon ) , which might contribute to post - anaesthesia safety .    2.1684800315284365
exposure of the skin to ultraviolet irradiation is an important risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma , with uva possibly UNK an important role .    3.2852664785351355
hereditary factors are also relevant .    2.765248176948772
in UNK UNK the dna repair defect is thought to be responsible for the high incidence of malignant melanoma .    3.1003785888386015
frequent and non - random changes in certain chromosomes have been demonstrated in melanoma cells .    2.534044432751384
these might contain sequences that control melanoma growth or melanoma suppressor genes .    2.034196902427599
especially the short arm of chromosome 9 is thought to contain one of these genes .    2.7530824219611203
this hypothesis is supported by a genetic linkage analysis in melanoma families and the demonstration of a germ line deletion of the locus 9p21 in a patient with eight primary melanomas .    2.374587543232866
changes in known tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have also been reported in melanoma , but no consistent sequence of genetic events is known .    2.287370287212398
neuropsychological studies could demonstrate increased risk for impaired attention and short term memory as well as a general reduced information processing speed in childhood ' s epilepsy .    2.3693395326243953
up to now it is not totally understood if focal eeg - pathology represents a specific cognitive deficit strongly related to the corresponding hemisphere ' s functions or represents a less UNK but more general cognitive deficit of both cerebral hemispheres .    2.0554969807048376
in a sample of 44 pediatric patients with epilepsy we studied sequential and simultaneous cognitive information processing .    2.110452187495827
as a major result a general decreased function in cognitive information processing ( more sequential than simultaneous ) has been found .    2.2408917779785202
there was no correlation with the localization of an eeg - focus nor with the hand preference .    2.3083164877006714
according to previous studies patients with an increased number of medical drugs or with presence of neuroradiological lesions are at greatest risk for cognitive impairment .    2.3177673507488312
our data indicate a possible affection of underlying UNK functions .    2.251955126588518
the aim of this prospective and randomized study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a reduced shock strength in transvenous implantable defibrillator therapy .    2.381269728276476
so far clinical data concerning the safety margin of the shock energy in icd therapy do not exist .    2.2787738068622683
the shock energy tested during long - term follow - up in this study was twice the intraoperatively measured defibrillation threshold ( dft ) .    2.7788659083161757
a total number of 176 consecutive patients representing a typical cohort of icd patients were evaluated .    2.310626713132083
all patients received a non - thoracotomy lead system ( UNK , UNK UNK , UNK ) and a biphasic cardioverter - defibrillator with the ability to store episodes ( cardiac pacemakers inc . , UNK UNK prx ii , prx iii ) .    2.924664366706551
the intraoperative defibrillation threshold ( dft ) was evaluated in a step - down protocol ( 15 , 10 , 8 , 5 j ) and hat to be < = 15 j for inclusion into the study .    2.240985807010694
the lowest effective energy terminating induced ventricular fibrillation had to be confirmed and was defined as dft + augmented defibrillation threshold .    2.468052372625797
the dft + value was tested immediately after successful implantation , at discharge , and after a follow - up period of one year .    2.568670446217118
prior to implantation the patients were randomized into two groups .    3.0395449994033874
the energy of the first shock in the study group was programmed at twice dft + and in the control group at the maximum energy output ( 34 j ) .    2.7516155908533473
the efficacy of the first shock and its reproducibility in dft UNK and in spontaneous episodes during long - term follow - up of the study group were compared to those in the control group .    3.0736000715089276
a dft + value was found to be < = 15 j in 166 of 176 patients ( 94 % ) .    2.299373570315748
the dft + in the study group was 9 . 6 + / - 3 . 2 ; in control group 10 . 1 + / - . 35 j .    2.8340171033592028
the UNK of successful defibrillation at dft + level after one year was 84 % .    2.294469702828971
the success rate of the first shock meant to terminate induced ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) was 99 . 5 % in the study group ( 217 of UNK episodes ) and 99 % in the control group ( 201 of 203 episodes ) .    2.6910936052177368
during follow - up of 24 + / - 9 months spontaneous episodes in the study group , 83 / 86 ( 96 . 5 ) monomorphic ventricular tachycardias ( UNK ) and 38 / 40 ( 95 % ) vf - episodes were converted successfully by the 2x dft + shock .    2.4993355321129815
in the control group the first shock was successful in 151 / 156 ( 96 . 8 % ) spontaneous UNK and in 30 / 33 ( 91 % ) vf episodes .    2.600427004764154
the efficacy of the first shock was not influenced by clinical data such as the underlying cardiac disease , left ventricular function , ongoing antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone , or the number of spontaneous episodes per day or by the dft itself .    2.7112625913770705
at a mean follow - up of two years there was no significant difference between the two groups concerning the incidence of sudden cardiac death ( 2 . 4 % in the study group vs . 3 . 8 % in the control group ) .    3.714748350128289
in conclusion programming the first shock with the icd lead system used in this study at 2x dft + is as efficient as a shock energy of 34 j in order to terminate induced and spontaneous episodes of vt / vf .    2.2351716489867757
thus , the safety of icd - therapy is not impaired when programming the shock energy at the 2x dft + value .    2.388246334260024
UNK deficits of the preoperative information cause a complete UNK of the whole medical intervention and lead to liability for any resulting damage .    2.7409933390609043
in cases of controversy it ' s the physician ' s due to prove the correct preoperative information .    2.4972234904959456
to reduce these liability - risks a computer based information system has been developed .    2.3360847738177766
with its help an working sheet is provided which is individually adjusted for the patient .    2.088804641970684
based upon this record the real preoperative information takes place .    2.2226871903600456
the conception ' s use over many years shows that UNK essential aspects and misunderstanding can grossly be excluded for the patient and a high quality of information can be reached .    2.412012095530761
in vitro culture of peritoneal explants of neonatal rats after previous application of agents UNK wound antisepsis is a sensitive screening method for the determination of the tissue compatibility of local wound UNK .    2.2407944729446037
two test models are differentiated : ( 1 ) separated peritoneal explants as a model for chronic or deep wounds and ( 2 ) peritoneum in situ in the experimental animal with subsequent extraction and cultivation of the explants .    2.076459607625331
considering the present state of knowledge the following conclusions can be drawn regarding antisepsis of wounds : UNK ( 0 . 1 % ) may be classified as the agent of choice for deep and chronic wounds , for UNK - UNK irrigation and for antiinfective lavage of body cavities inclusively for peritoneal lavage ( 0 , 05 % ) .    2.4164822183717085
UNK is UNK effective in long term application ( > 6 h ) , and because of its UNK effect as well as lack of UNK it is especially suitable for peritoneal lavage .    3.1149986407587433
UNK solution is very well suited for superficial contaminated wounds and can be used in a dilution of 1 : 10 for short - term rinsing of deep wounds , including body cavities but not for peritoneal lavage .    2.4584255443083234
ethanol causes no inhibition of UNK growth and therefore UNK its importance in wound antisepsis .    2.324247358472758
pain is a widely occurring disturbance of well - being and has serious consequences for the quality of life of patients suffering from acute or chronic pain .    2.876565986468252
thus , pain makes high demands on the health system .    2.5353158044263493
for the first time in the federal republic of germany the national health interview and examination survey allows to make representative statements concerning the prevalence of pain , its intensity , frequency , duration and localisation .    2.1251670316536186
furthermore , the results enable to differentiate according to age , gender , and social classes .    2.5330295860431002
the sf - 36 , used as an instrument to measure health related quality of life , has been employed to demonstrate the UNK significance of pain for the well - being of the population .    2.7459055197669473
in this publication the connection between certain disease syndromes like migraine and arthrosis and the prevalence of different qualities of pain is investigated .    2.2138220751767115
additional more complex evaluation of the epidemiological data on pain are in preparation .    2.7623446022312548
in order to get an effective therapy of UNK UNK drug must penetrate into the follicles .    2.47565075436774
this can not be obtained exclusively by local treatment so that a combination with systemic therapy is necessary .    2.579472165826791
UNK is the drug of choice in childhood until now .    2.8715079202597544
death may occur while a UNK or UNK suspect is taken into UNK by the police .    2.810973847971754
we report about this type of acute death in two males .    2.525421259171969
in both cases , a cocaine intoxication was taken as the cause of death despite an initial suspicion of a direct association between the death and police measures ( e . g .    2.2588154584573057
neck compression or " UNK " , chest compression ) .    2.8765260192740993
from the institute ' s autopsy material we selected another 12 cases with UNK by cocaine as the cause of death of as a secondary finding for comparison .    2.1412763589290407
of the 12 cases 5 were UNK injuries and 4 were classified as suicide .    2.53778329410621
the analysis suggested an increased UNK to apply force against themselves or others under the influence of cocaine .    2.3373354171051415
in both cases , cardiac arrest occurred suddenly and unexpectedly for all those involved and who were UNK of any acute life - threatening situation because of the extreme attempts of the UNK to flee or UNK arrest .    2.515062998298636
attention should be given to these types of cases during the training of police UNK .    2.4321752151342033
abstract hepatitis c antibodies have been detected in more then half of all autopsies of drug - related deaths in a 2 - year period since november 1995 in UNK , germany .    2.625966324487315
it was of interest whether there is a risk of hcv transmission from the UNK .    3.0218816091264453
the presence of hcv - rna indicates UNK in the living but this may be different post - mortem .    2.8132407603712117
to our knowledge no case of UNK infection from a corpse has been reported so far .    2.549413860905768
non - traumatic UNK fistulae are rare , but may be the source of massive UNK bleeding with associated fever and sepsis .    2.8282353931219957
these fistulae result from penetrating duodenal peptic ulcers or right nephrectomy and subsequent radiation to the upper abdomen .    2.008582617674396
the outcome depends on early diagnosis and surgery before a potentially fatal hemorrhage occurs .    2.4296541416779966
the therapy of choice includes closure of the fistula and repair of the duodenum and inferior vena cava .    2.394384788682904
we describe the seventh case with radiogenic duodenal ulcer .    2.1953369365624145
the patient survived following partial UNK ( whipple ) .    2.2315548391629485
purpose : branch retinal vein occlusion ( brvo ) induces variable functional deficits depending on the grade of vascular occlusion and its localisation .    2.222506477789706
UNK deficiences are not easily defined by visual acuity measurements .    2.2692787209800085
however , UNK offers topical mapping of retinal function , allowing precise documentation of the intensity and dimension of retinal functional loss in brvo .    2.0882345932237896
acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) is rare but UNK with a high mortality rate .    2.7210380545911654
in recent years , however , a trend towards higher survival rates has been observed .    2.6806148523818623
high inspiratory oxygen concentrations , large tidal volumes , and high peak inspiratory airway pressures applied during mechanical ventilation have been identified as harmful to the lung and can contribute to the progression of ards .    2.2779914957642036
this had led to reconsideration of the sequelae of ventilatory therapy .    2.3272591418283186
mechanical ventilation and other adjunctive strategies in ards have changed from the conventional approach aiming at normalisation of physiological ventilatory parameters to an elaborated approach that intends to protect the ventilated lung , prevent oxygen toxicity , UNK the infiltrated atelectatic and consolidated lung and reduce the anatomical and alveolar dead space .    1.8617079710623516
this new approach consists of various forms of pressure - controlled mechanical ventilation with peep and permissive hypercapnia , body position changes , and inhalation of nitric oxide .    2.1618849250516203
should these procedures fail to improve impaired gas exchange , extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is an additional therapeutic option .    2.1985768063363276
none of these therapeutic procedures , however , has been tested against traditional standard treatment in a classical randomised controlled trial .    2.857221534838394
the following review focuses on the latest insights into the pathophysiology , diagnosis , and treatment of ards .    3.041357024701014
femoral neck fractures are frequent fractures of the elderly .    3.632070696544146
they can be treated by the use of dynamic hip screws , lag screws , bipolar UNK or total hip replacement .    2.8408249645016173
the results are markedly influenced by the timing of the operation and the choice of the implant .    3.1032824267749755
using the garden classification of femoral neck fracture we demonstrate a different therapeutic approach according to garden stadium i - iv .    2.127621351100449
stool frequency after ileal pouch - anal anastomosis ( ipaa ) is about 5 / day after adaptation during the first year .    2.2799758167356625
it depends on stool volume and pouch capacity , not on the design of the pouch .    2.4804894198712018
in most cases evacuation is spontaneous and as complete as in healthy rectum .    2.1255790962341474
67 % of patients are perfectly continent , while 19 % have to wear UNK due to intermittent leakage .    2.5689141628727903
complete incontinence is reported in 0 - 4 % of the patients .    2.788927262729444
impairment of continence is caused by damage of the internal sphincter with consecutive decrease of the pouch - anal pressure gradient .    2.9032707208981186
despite altered reflex activity , stool discrimination is preserved in most patients .    2.1919675639210525
alterations in bile acid metabolism are lower after ipaa than after ileostomy .    2.1447499573548523
bacterial overgrowth may lead to deterioration of the functional results .    3.1242932507226935
background : methods from the area of virtual reality are used in oral and maxillofacial surgery for the planning and three - dimensional individual simulation of surgeries .    2.539400275292783
thirty - seven patients with chronic sinus UNK were treated after total excision by UNK flap .    2.67323588661534
we saw seroma complications in three and wound infections in two cases .    2.3824392812803863
patients stayed in hospital 6 . 3 days on an average and were able to work after 2 . 5 weeks .    3.004978908295473
the method is easy to use .    2.772997366962608
we have not seen a return to sinus problems in any of this cases .    2.3035183987367724
we describe a patient who was admitted to hospital because of hypoglycemic convulsions at the age of 6 months .    2.7423780592818034
diagnostics revealed that the hypoglycemic episodes were caused by glycogen synthase deficiency .    2.5410301276391176
glycogen synthase deficiency its a rare cause of fasting hypoglycemia in childhood associated with normal production of UNK bodies .    2.1274601473010586
it is characterized by supranormal increase of glucose and lactate in blood after a meal or an oral glucose tolerance test .    1.9789048815523678
diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of a reduced activity of glycogen synthase in liver tissue , and lately also by identification of pathogenic mutations in the UNK gene ( UNK - gene ) .    2.5682354126321125
hypoglycemic episodes can be prevented by offering frequent protein - rich UNK during the day and a late evening meal with UNK UNK starch .    2.3722750834634643
although most subacromial UNK are performed arthroscopically , rotator cuff repair is still performed using an open or mini - open procedure .    2.1797556618118357
arthroscopic techniques have improved in the last decade , however , so that rotator cuff repair can also be performed arthroscopically .    3.2947370601475234
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) has become a well - established method for the diagnosis of diseases of the heart and the great vessels .    3.363348006230879
almost 20 % of all patients cannot be completely examined by transthoracic echocardiography .    2.8835427913575096
however , there are clinical problems for which mri may be used as the first line technique such as complex congenital heart disease , diseases of the great vessels , pericardial disease or cardiac tumors .    2.633389535860809
mri is undergoing rapid technical improvement and this will further improve the diagnostic utility of the technique , especially in patients with coronary artery disease .    2.626653985017245
in the last 7 years we have performed 220 infrainguinal vein bypasses associated with critical limb ischemia .    2.2531057087112285
all patients were prospectively controlled in a follow - up program 3 - 72 months postoperatively .    2.600432769566253
the patients were divided into two groups : patients with diabetes mellitus ( 35 % , group 1 ) and patients without diabetes mellitus ( 65 % , group 2 ) .    2.9645273402316517
there was no difference in sex , age or localization of distal anastomosis ( supra - or UNK ) between the two groups .    2.259525735088832
the primary and the primary - assisted patency rates were not statistically different after 60 months .    2.188828790543678
there was a significant difference in limb salvage .    2.7726491891243894
the limb salvage of group 1 was 75 % after 60 months , while the limb salvage of group 2 was 95 % ( p = 0 . 0045 ) .    2.480174015175521
the rate of major amputations was significantly higher in group 1 ( 15 . 6 % ) than in group 2 ( 4 . 9 % , p = 0 . UNK ) .    3.352443030552138
the indication for amputation was persistent foot infection .    2.363732273278649
a 24 - year - old woman with lymph vessel dysplasia had experienced a progressive edema of her legs since her second year of life and progressive facial edema for the past year .    2.206065339754576
she also had UNK and papules on the background of a diffuse erythema as well as marked seborrhea on her face .    2.5059894248041625
histopathological examination of a representative facial lesion revealed a granulomatous dermatitis with UNK distribution mainly consisting of lymphocytes and histiocytes .    2.0921032503319803
in addition , there was a moderate fibrosis of the dermis with numerous mast cells .    2.4673997509616066
by duplex ultrasound , a diagnosis of a massive edema of the legs without evidence for chronic venous insufficiency was made .    2.7979032153699164
the chronic course , absence of serological abnormalities and nonspecific histopathological features as well as resistance to therapy are the most important diagnostic UNK of this disease also known as morbihan ' s disease .    2.9301092136130125
the cervical spine is an extremely complex functional unit and has always been the subject of UNK discussions among surgeons , orthopedic specialists and neurologists .    2.2315856227543933
in the presence of injuries affecting this section of the spine , which sometimes have grave consequences - including implications for legal insurance aspects , neurologists are usually at the end of the line when it comes to diagnosis and treatment .    2.2342575677761274
in fact , in view of the clinical and technical neurophysiological options available to neurologists , it would be desirable for them to be involved as early as possible .    2.4959879181584497
in this paper the relative value of neurology , compared with orthopedics and surgery , in the diagnosis and treatment of whiplash injury to the cervical spine is discussed .    2.835033247410141
the newer options available - particularly in neurophysiology - are highlighted , as are the differential diagnosis and problems concerned with official expert assessments , which also involve other specialties .    2.0069853563993987
a 19 - year - old male patient with chronic cutaneous UNK was treated UNK with paromomycin sulphate ( 15 % ) and UNK chloride ( 12 % ) in UNK UNK .    2.9685661474508773
after application twice daily for two periods of 32 and 44 days the lesions were completely healed .    2.1453132074376198
previous treatment for 9 months with ketoconazole ( 400 mg / day ) together with the topical application of UNK ( 2 . 5 % ) in base had been unsuccessful .    3.1483878614666634
no major side effects were observed after paromomycin sulphate application .    2.819911167533922
eight patients with spontaneous spinal epidural hemorrhages are presented .    2.4504075304412125
all eight initially had suffered from severe neck or back pain .    2.390367755007542
in seven cases , progressive neurological deficits had developed , some of which led to complete paraplegia .    2.356333581345024
on all eight patients operations were performed .    2.689528335456399
after an average of 11 weeks ' follow - up , full recovery from the preoperative pain and neurological deficits could be seen in 6 of the patients .    2.6768976086358798
the confusion of scientific , economic , UNK and professional contexts is the reason for the present uneasiness within therapeutic culture .    2.7022732259927764
the author UNK for autonomy of these contexts to defend the profession UNK against powerful UNK by other contexts .    1.9909480370360257
the debate about UNK ( " empirically supported therapy " ) is being drawn upon to show that the list of criteria for differentiation of effective and ineffective therapies is not warranted .    2.260114085519203
scientific or economic dominance claims might have deteriorating effects in the professional fields , as well - known researchers meanwhile fear .    2.5238342558843057
in economic contexts the aim is efficiency , in professional contexts it is quality .    2.1855568101453575
to develop own quality measures has the aim to promote the profession as a learning organization .    2.1195580210371596
this could help to rise professionals ' self - confidence .    2.2028747282861203
procalcitonin is the propeptide of calcitonin devoid of hormonal activity .    2.200147710795779
normally , procalcitonin is produced in the c - cells of the thyroid gland .    2.1008210792409336
in healthy humans procalcitonin levels are UNK ( < 0 . 1 ng / ml ) .    2.8108037785263487
in contrast , severe viral infections or inflammatory reactions of non - infectious origin do not or very moderately increase procalcitonin levels .    2.333724806305228
the exact site of procalcitonin production is not exactly known but even large amounts of procalcitonin released during infections do not lead to an increase in plasma calcitonin level or activity .    2.164116481207782
in this retrospective study , oncologic and functional results of 24 patients treated for glomus jugulare tumor stages c and d are reported .    2.340737734961956
the surgical approach used was a combined transmastoid - transcervical approach , which was modified according to individual tumor growth .    2.4994343921918167
as needed , this was combined with a UNK or UNK approach .    3.8362657531106996
complete tumor removal resulted in a cure rate of 100 % .    2.5979228606994687
surgically induced cranial nerve palsies developed in 38 % of the patients .    2.506281880264822
in 54 % of cases it was possible to UNK middle ear function .    3.3837359708762054
seven patients had incomplete tumor removal requiring postoperative irradiation , with tumor progression occurring in 2 patients .    2.2340879479711004
radical tumor removal was modified by efforts to reduce mutilating resections .    2.218785108031922
these results show that individually tailored and combined UNK surgical approaches can allow total tumor removal to be performed with lower morbidity .    2.278565531073675
electron beam ct , which does not require mechanical movement of an x - ray tube , has a temporal resolution which exceeds that of conventional computed tomography by a factor of about ten .    2.245121113991328
axial images of the heart can be acquired within 50 to 100 ms with a spatial resolution below 0 . 5 mm2 and permit precise visualization of all cardiac structures .    2.236623554249808
ecg - triggered acquisition of 30 to 40 axial images ( 3 mm slice thickness ) in a short inspiratory breathhold allows one to sample a 3 - dimensional volume data set which covers the complete heart .    2.045339611799059
overall acquisition times are approximately 30 to 50 seconds .    2.3004212374899
while electron beam ct in general permits a complete cardiac investigation , including morphology , function , and perfusion , the method ' s most important application is non - invasive imaging of the coronary arteries .    2.2881817677883967
without contrast enhancement , coronary calcification by ebct currently constitutes the most sensitive non - invasive marker for the presence even of very early forms of coronary atherosclerosis .    2.216548402952595
UNK injection of contrast agent during image acquisition additionally permits the selective visualization of the coronary artery lumen and detection of significant stenoses .    2.354377749669706
breathhold and movement artifacts , superposition of coronary arteries and veins , as well as severe coronary calcifications currently constitute the method ' s main problems .    2.3357294489375553
in spite of these limitations , electron beam ct has been shown to permit clinically valuable non - invasive investigations of the coronary arteries , which may be further refined as technology progresses .    2.6383799711982574
despite the availability of diagnostic modalities such as transesophageal echocardiography , computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging up to 30 % of patients with acute aortic dissection remain undiagnosed before death .    2.7695394325194114
a novel immunoassay of serum smooth muscle myosin as a potential diagnostic tool for the detection of aortic dissection .    2.69740848770695
the immunoassay was applied in two patients with an acute chest pain syndrome but no initial suspicion of aortic disease .    2.791012175360688
in both patients myocardial ischemia was ruled out by laboratory , electrocardiographic and echocardiographic examination .    2.1679511524204056
in the first patient both dilation of the UNK and long - standing arterial hypertension were known ; however , it was not before 48h until dissection was suspected and a spiral - ct was performed demonstrating a localized ascending aortic dissection .    2.610656197265377
at this time ( 48 h after onset of symptoms ) the smooth muscle myosin heavy chain concentration in the serum was close to normal .    2.350838483008729
in the other patient there was neither a suggestive history nor any clinical sign of aortic dissection .    2.227165313461401
widening of the abdominal was the key to the incidental diagnosis of a clinically unsuspected type b dissection .    2.638701650928628
the serum test 12 h after onset of pain revealed elevated ( diagnostic ) serum levels of smooth muscle myosin heavy chains .    2.12753168360091
recurrent abdominal pain is found in 10 - 25 % of school - aged children , thus being one of the most frequent complaints in childhood .    2.725092272408969
despite that , our knowledge about this syndrome is still very incomplete .    2.615917372316481
following oral surgery , there are sometimes disturbances in wound healing .    2.80270066370173
it was the aim of this investigation to look for relationships between the composition of saliva and disturbed wound healing .    2.2944327692016313
resting as well as stimulated fasting whole saliva was collected from 96 patients ( 19 to 53 years of age ) prior to oral surgery .    2.5556769323044546
the salivary data of eight patients who suffered from disturbed wound healing were compared to the data of 20 randomly selected patients with normal wound healing .    2.934334156090273
patients with disturbed wound healing revealed increased activities and secretion rates for peroxidase in resting saliva .    2.091324467958388
in stimulated saliva , decreased secretion rates for thiocyanate and total protein were found .    2.075615588087193
not a single salivary factor was able to discriminate both groups of patients with sufficient accuracy , but with a combination of tissue type plasminogen activator , peroxidase , plus secretory immunoglobulin a measurements from resting whole saliva a clearly improved and acceptable discrimination of the two patient groups was possible .    2.1905956423658477
a discriminant function including six salivary factors could be used to completely separate both groups .    2.3352900440981554
nuclear imaging methods provide noninvasive UNK of myocardial function , perfusion , and metabolism and are well accepted in clinical cardiology .    2.165836129033919
advances in prevention and treatment of cardiac disease have resulted in decreasing cardiovascular mortality in industrialized nations .    2.484000644126523
the improvement in therapeutic options has increased the demand for diagnostic tests that might guide clinical decision making .    2.2267263952999254
information beyond the pure anatomic characterization of coronary stenoses is required .    2.295571250164825
nuclear imaging can be used for early detection and monitoring of the severity and extent of disease .    3.479024957233219
the prognostic potential of such functional testing is being increasingly appreciated and used to guide therapy , thereby resulting in improvement of the quality and cost - effectiveness of the workup of patients with cardiovascular disease .    2.5973913595032796
extensive clinical validation has resulted in growing acceptance of these techniques .    2.510011174031539
furthermore , ongoing improvement of imaging techniques and development of new UNK will pave the way for disease - specific , molecular - targeted cardiac imaging in the future .    2.4865408106035667
epidural anaesthesia for elective caesarean section can have advantages over general anaesthesia .    2.3390432143147675
the anaesthesiologist can avoid endotracheal intubation as well as fetal depression following placental transfer of systemic anaesthetics .    2.4727574998112116
however , despite reaching an effective blockade preoperatively , intraoperative discomfort and pain may occur during epidural anaesthesia with local anaesthetics alone , necessitating supplemental systemic analgesics or even conversion to general anaesthesia [ 21 ] .    1.918386414216893
addition of epidural fentanyl has been shown to improve onset and quality of perioperative analgesia without evident side effects for mother or newborn [ 24 ] .    2.2495880900238325
nevertheless , administration of epidural opioids before cord clamping is still UNK debated , some UNK maternal and or neonatal depression [ 6 , 26 ] .    1.930627191159975
the aim of the present study was to investigate the quality of analgesia , associated side effects and the resulting maternal and neonatal plasma opiate concentrations after a single preoperative addition of 0 . 1 mg fentanyl to epidural bupivacaine analgesia in comparison to epidural bupivacaine analgesia alone .    2.4422955441337972
the quality of the morphological analysis of myocardial and coronary alterations depends essentially on the method chosen for the heart dissection .    2.1572853508385896
even if previous postmortem coronary angioplasty is not feasible , the best results are obtained by transverse sectioning of the ventricles in a UNK - UNK fashion subsequent to formalin - fixation and serial cross - sectioning of the coronary arteries , with decalcification in addition if necessary .    2.336957096230891
the distribution pattern of disseminated myocardial necrosis , the longitudinal , circumferential and transmural extent of infarction , its age and sequelae and its correlation to the coronary supplying areas can be evaluated with better accuracy than by UNK the heart chambers according to the flow of blood .    2.3101441367386393
cross - sectioning of coronary arteries with preservation of their luminal shape allows proper examination of the degree and extent of luminal narrowing , plaque hemorrhage , parietal and UNK thrombi and the effects and complications of UNK procedures or bypass surgery .    2.2800211948108022
transverse sectioning of the heart is a prerequisite for adequate examination following sudden cardiac death and short - term territorial ischemia .    2.818096348652202
full - thickness samples of the ventricular walls , taken systematically with respect to coronary narrowing and coronary supplying areas , enable identification of early myocardial damage .    2.215926869915422
total hip replacement is one of the most successful procedures in surgery .    2.9317376563950175
in germany there is a great variety of cemented and uncemented implants with different principles of fixation .    2.415777035621709
we reviewed the different principles , with particular reference to long - term clinical outcome , and discuss the most popular systems available in germany .    2.5971542797321354
despite many new developments which have been made in the field of cementless hip replacement , cemented total hip arthroplasty will remain the " gold standard " until prospective long - term data ( > 15 years ) of cementless systems become available .    2.360576662759845
to summarize current knowledge on surgical therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( crohn ' s disease , ulcerative colitis and diverticulitis ) .    2.5596825599086297
procalcitonin is a propeptide of calcitonin .    2.5748629128075997
it is usually not detectable in healthy volunteers but appears in high concentrations in the serum of patients with severe bacterial , parasitic or fungal infection .    2.613670444200114
in contrast , procalcitonin levels do not or only moderately increase during viral infections or during non - infectious systemic inflammatory states .    2.1417871554339563
because of these properties , procalcitonin has been proposed to serve as a marker of severe infections and sepsis .    2.4877355296763253
increased procalcitonin levels have recently been shown to indicate the severity of systemic infection with increasing specificity .    2.8368420594651726
normally , procalcitonin is produced in the c - cells of the thyroid gland .    2.1008210792409336
the origin of the high levels of procalcitonin in septic conditions is not fully understood .    2.7390266423236356
although procalcitonin has drawn attention as a marker of severe systemic infections , a recent study suggests it may also be a mediator of sepsis .    2.278989956712447
more studies are needed to UNK the nature and pathophysiological role of this molecule .    3.0367331245528684
fractures of the hand UNK are common injuries .    3.149828765937305
these are or are associated with phalangeal fractures .    2.72452030884981
kirschner wires can be used for osteosynthesis , but can cause lesions of periphereal finger structures .    2.6438680180841905
we found an increase of insertion attempt frequency and an increasing number of lesions with increasing kirschner wire diameter .    2.598082799210015
because of these findings kirschner wires of 1 . 0 or 1 . 25 mm diameter should be prefered to prevent the periphereal functional finger structures .    2.4233276243110917
UNK , a rare lysosomal storage disease due to nearly complete deficiency of - l - fucosidase , was diagnosed in two unrelated male german patients who exhibited typical symptoms of this disorder including mental retardation , dysostosis multiplex , UNK of lymphocytes and progressive neurologic deterioration by the age of 3 . 2 and 4 years , respectively .    2.4020567249783737
in both cases , activity of - l - fucosidase in leukocytes and cultivated fibroblasts was negligible .    2.062356209367148
dna analysis revealed a UNK mutation ( g401x ) in exon 7 of the fucosidase gene ; this leads to a premature stop UNK and c - terminal deletion of 61 amino acids from the protein .    2.1714930118923994
discussion : on account of the mutation a unique UNK restriction site is obliterated ; this UNK molecular diagnosis of the g401x mutation .    2.138585971830888
so far , the mutation g401x has not been found in any other population .    2.5794387608123537
the main reason for posttraumatic secondary brain damage is cerebral hypoxia .    2.329770277916719
both , severity and duration of hypoxia are crucial in determining wether irreversible cerebral infarction will occur or not .    2.186364701595809
for the clinical routine , the diagnosis of hypoxia is indirectly made by low cpp , low jugularvenous oxygen saturation ( sjo2 ) or low tissue po2 .    2.267546263393787
to minimize misleading false negative sjo2 , the ct - approach for the side of UNK and calculation of arterial - jugularvenous lactate content for detection of anaerobic metabolism is recommended .    2.370505790555635
targeted treatment of hypoxia according to the underlying cause is mandatory .    3.0101915573295828
primary goal is to increase cellular oxygen delivery by correction of low arterial oxygen content and elevation of regional cbf .    2.267436653065416
within the autoregulatory range decreasing cpp causes vasodilation and increasing cpp vasoconstriction with increasing or decreasing cerebral blood volume respectively .    1.9559153651554786
initially elevation of the lower autoregulatory threshold often requires cpp 70 mmhg .    2.6264935038598045
targeted treatment of intracranial hypertension must avoid decreasing cpp .    2.371111113800729
in the early UNK phase prevention of cerebral hypoxia UNK on management of cbf by means of cpp and cerebral vascular resistance .    2.3373413895913835
today , orthotopic liver transplantation is the treatment of choice for the end - stage of various liver diseases , and a 1 - year survival rate of 80 % and a 5 - year survival rate of 70 % in elective patients without tumor are reported in international surveys .    2.9864230190168017
the liver transplant programme of the inselspital in bern is small compared with international centres , which may raise questions about the results and the justification for such a programme .    2.1883983244447602
over a period of 66 months , 62 liver transplantations were performed in 60 patients at the inselspital .    2.520143316235151
the hospital mortality was 3 . 3 % , and the 2 . 5 - year overall survival rate was 92 % for elective cases without tumor .    3.3790958804261506
after a median follow - up of 30 months , 68 % of all patients were re - integrated in UNK or full - or part - time in their profession , and 83 % were independent from the help of others .    2.6100540055587484
we conclude that a small liver transplant programme based only on routine resources can achieve results comparable to the international standards .    2.104495504348538
accidental hypothermia ( ah ) can be defined as an unintentional decrease in core temperature below 35 °c during cold exposure by individuals without intrinsic UNK dysfunction .    2.025483158613972
pathophysiological changes can be attributed both to the severity of hypothermia and to co - morbid factors such as trauma , UNK , intoxication and underlying diseases .    2.6582431073235555
in trauma victims stratified according to the injury severity score , the factor hypothermia is considered to be a poor prognostic sign for survival .    2.730694525338023
in these patients rewarming therapy should be applied as soon as possible .    2.7191020792164533
in the UNK university hospital , adult patients with ah are managed according to an algorithm based on their presenting hemodynamic conditions .    2.2886961570166737
patients with UNK cardiac rhythms and systolic pressures over 80 mmhg will receive continuous arteriovenous rewarming ( cavr ) .    2.0092695627771864
arrested and hemodynamically instable patients are treated with cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) .    2.2297274836293117
in a 3 - year period , 22 patients with ah were admitted to the emergency department .    3.0857893224548314
fourteen patients had a trauma as the cause of hypothermia .    3.253451602245858
twenty patients were treated according to the algorithm ( cavr n = 18 , cpb n = 2 ) and two patients were alternatively managed .    3.002324176620031
mortality in the cavr group was 28 % and total mortality reached 32 % .    2.2441493914919057
complications of cavr are related to placement and removal of vascular catheters and may be severe in these patients with impaired coagulation .    2.5223606402244707
cavr permits a good access to the ( trauma - ) patient and rewarming can be continued synchronously with diagnosis and treatment of various injuries .    2.3344692761267414
the grading of long - tubular - bone pseudarthrosis depends on the biological reaction or lack of reaction in pseudarthrosis or non - unions .    2.5395945173324956
hypertrophic and UNK pseudarthrosis belongs to biologically reacting non - unions , whereas non - reacting non - unions are necrotic pseudarthrosis and defective non - unions with partial decline or complete destruction of cortical substance .    1.9240967159049138
pseudarthrosis is a serious disturbance or disorder within the regulation cycle in fracture healing , which consists of UNK , UNK and stabilization .    2.724187011872438
the causes and underlying reasons for disturbance of this regulation cycle are primarily massive destruction of the biological and functional very important unity of periost , cortical substance and medullary space .    2.0420160340699485
this can occur from trauma , but it happens more often from surgical procedures that do not take the biological principles of bone - healing into account .    2.389535190890597
surgical strategies and interventions that respect the importance of periosteal tissue , cortical tissue and medullary space do fill the biological principles of fracture - healing and fracture union .    2.1707721559391233
background : clonidine , an 2 - receptor agonist , has been reported to prolong the blocking actions of local anaesthetics .    2.499049812469932
the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of UNK injected clonidine on the duration of spinal anaesthesia by mepivacaine and on the postoperative demand for analgesics .    2.406102580074399
differentiation of an elevated , repeatedly determined platelet count ( > = UNK / l ) includes the discrimination between reactive causes generated by a variety of underlying conditions and a neoplastic UNK - UNK disorder ( cmpd ) .    2.4324561007766494
in addition to clinical findings , the evolution of laboratory data during follow - up and histology of the bone marrow exerts a significant diagnostic impact .    2.6959423719195468
characteristic features are not only expressed by hematopoiesis , but also by the myeloid stromal compartment .    2.679913254412449
while the megakaryocyte - rich subtype of chronic myeloid leukemia ( cml ) and the UNK - syndrome ( mds ) are dominated by abnormal UNK , in polycythemia vera ( pv ) this cell lineage reveals a UNK appearance .    2.436962870646879
in essential thrombocythemia ( et ) , a prevalence of giant megakaryocytes with deeply lobulated ( UNK - like ) nuclei may be encountered .    2.523245484437044
a clear - cut discrimination of et from early ( UNK ) stages of idiopathic ( primary ) myelofibrosis ( imf ) presenting with thrombocythemia becomes possible , provided the conspicuous atypical features of megakaryopoiesis UNK the latter entity are taken into account .    1.967725999559645
moreover , cml displays a predominance of the granulocytic lineage whereas pv shows a UNK or UNK proliferation , involving erythropoiesis , in particular .    2.3173551291986656
in contrast , erythropoiesis is markedly reduced in cml and to a lesser degree also in imf .    2.1948229933316368
in cmpds extreme values of iron deposits may be found , ranging from a total lack ( pv ) to minor amounts ( cml ) and a normal staining reaction ( et ) .    2.30690864123033
similar results are exhibited regarding UNK fibrosis , which is usually not present in et , rarely observed in pv and detectable to a variable degree in cml and imf .    2.2006466047423547
nevus cell aggregates in lymph nodes are uncommon .    2.700918846313502
this benign phenomenon may be difficult to differentiate from metastatic neoplasia .    2.590224040280987
we report the case of a 56 - year - old patient who underwent breast biopsy , followed by radical mastectomy including lymphadenectomy .    2.5217959962680685
strong immunohistological staining for the s - 100 protein confirmed the diagnosis of nevus cell aggregates .    2.7818633480002246
we report the case of a seven year old girl presenting with varicella infection 14 days after kidney transplantation .    2.2212353917830443
UNK - like abdominal pain and a UNK were the first symptoms .    3.450715879652879
UNK did not relieve the symptoms , and the following UNK with UNK catheter explantation was performed which did not reveal any pathologic abnormalities .    2.862323589991198
two days after the beginning of abdominal pain an unspecific papular rash developed .    2.7494244204585554
further twelve hours later skin vesicles appeared and varicella - zoster virus was isolated from their fluid .    2.0262299827499834
despite high dose administration of aciclovir and varicella - zoster immune UNK further visceral dissemination occurred and finally lead to liver failure and intravascular coagulopathy .    1.8471604366692096
the patient died 18 days after kidney transplantation from multiorgan failure .    2.361005237104731
the unconscious patient presents an challenging emergency in the intensive care unit .    2.1548283217094157
patient evaluation and treatment must occur simultaneously .    2.5592427520297103
after checking vital signs , deciding about cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation , an intravenous line must be established , blood samples collected and glucose and thiamine should be given .    1.999722387010456
the physical and neurological examination should be performed in a efficient way and must consider the following eight points : best reaction to loud UNK , best motor reaction to noxious stimuli , respiratory pattern , size and reactions of pupils , eye movements , corneal and UNK reflex , UNK , muscle tone and deep tendon reflexes .    2.101860834972242
with this approach it is possible to UNK a working diagnosis , and the appropriate diagnostic steps can be performed .    3.226579159032562
a severe course of alcohol withdrawal has been observed in 28 % of patients in a neurological intensive care unit due to complicating central nerve system ( cns ) diseases .    2.623711396165248
in any atypical alcoholic delirium , especially with focal neurological signs , partial seizures , or decreased level of consciousness , cns diseases like meningoencephalitis , intracranial hemorrhage , or central pontine UNK must be diagnosed by computed tomography ( ct ) scan and cerebral spinal fluid ( csf ) tap .    1.9996586298592187
the diagnostic and prognostic value of ct scan and csf analysis was examined in 32 persons with alcohol withdrawal syndrome or delirium tremens .    2.260084038721719
neurological complications and cerebral convulsions at the beginning of delirium tremens appear to predispose the patient to a protracted clinical course and necessary mechanical ventilation .    2.309800638909665
blood - csf barrier permeability is increased in 70 % of alcohol withdrawal patients and that also seems to be a marker of a prolonged clinical course .    2.5468743556228035
cerebral atrophy as shown in ct scan does not play a role in predicting clinical course .    2.2736582152558884
in our experience , ct examination or lumbar puncture is not necessarily recommended if clinical signs are typical for alcohol delirium .    2.123516631967633
recently , an implantable hearing aid for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss has been developed .    2.6236278920289178
one component of the device is the microphone for implantation into the posterior canal wall .    2.3986903917794424
in the study presented here , the microphone was implanted into 50 cadaver specimens of human temporal bone .    2.4216923698957373
localization of the microphone was determined by the anatomical situation of the facial nerve .    3.3245921926735207
the microphone and the piezoelectric transducer could be implanted in 78 % of the temporal bones after total UNK .    2.6905659364024928
in the final version of the microphone , the size was 4 . 5 mm and total weight 400 mg .    2.681592076476598
collagen vascular diseases , representing systemic soft tissue disorders , may cause a broad spectrum of pathologic changes of the respiratory tract .    2.566139221970399
the type and extent of manifestations can vary considerably among individuals and entities .    2.4130230231874936
this survey describes the chest radiographic and , in particular , high - resolution computed tomographic ( hrct ) findings of individual lesions of the respiratory tract .    2.7563938128510688
it includes UNK alveolitis ( alveolitis , interstitial pneumonia , pulmonary fibrosis ) and bronchial ( UNK / bronchiolitis , UNK ) , pleural and vascular manifestations , as well as lymphadenopathy and abnormalities related to therapy .    2.3501518782442177
we present typical patterns of changes in progressive systemic sclerosis ( pss , scleroderma ) , systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) , mixed connective tissue disease ( UNK , sharp syndrome ) , sjögren syndrome , overlap syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) .    2.0940783905900004
the psychodynamics of patients with severe personality disorders , eating disorders , or " hysterical " symptoms are increasingly understood as ways of coping with traumatic experiences in childhood or adolescence such as abuse or violence .    2.218872947264583
dissociation with induced depersonalisation , derealisation , and UNK of objects as only good or only bad is the central coping mechanism during and after a traumatic experience .    2.3361547940722796
UNK UNK of traumata have a retraumatizing effect and call for defence through eating disorders , substance abuse , self - UNK behaviour , or social acting - out .    2.297693041265756
against this psychodynamic background we describe a method of trauma - therapy which uses experiences of hypnotherapy and of guided affective imagery .    2.179330245220936
in the UNK phase a secure inner space and contact to inner UNK are established in the imagination using a resource - oriented approach .    2.265839876462071
the actual trauma - therapy consists of a gradual leading - up to the traumatic scenes through consistent , minimally retraumatizing confrontation , followed by UNK and the ability to UNK go .    2.8829132678299185
in the final phase there is a return to resource - oriented UNK and concrete life planning .    2.5689665739739724
all patients of the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery at the UNK hospital with odontogenic pyogenic infections have been analyzed in a retrospective study over a period of 10 years , from 1987 to 1997 .    2.7802849789600783
this included questions concerning frequency , seriousness and treatment of these infections , social changes in the UNK prove effects about the referral behaviour and the course .    2.827541619925464
odontogenic pyogenic infections are mixed infections .    2.5776396700085815
aerobic agents such as hemolytic UNK and UNK as well as anaerobic bacteria and fungi can be involved .    2.832584128028806
cephalosporine , UNK in combination with - UNK inhibitor , UNK and UNK are recommended based on analysis of infection resistance as first choice medications with UNK as a reserve antibiotic .    2.6993150890349313
hospitals are competing with each other for the limited financial resources available in the health care sector .    2.2493268623287515
comparison of hospitals is legally required ( bpflv § 5 ) to improve financial efficiency in the health care sector and make competition between hospitals UNK , while also UNK it .    2.0264418295084257
if comparison of the hospitals is really to enhance UNK or efficiency , and not just to reduce the prices for hospital stays regardless of quality , it must extend to far more than the global figures in the compilation UNK performance and calculation and the hospital statistics ( no .    2.030198821250064
of cases , days of care , length of stay , case lump sums and special fees ) .    2.559105076081933
documentation of particular features of the patient population , the potentials of the hospital and description of the treatment processes yield valuable information on capacity and performance level .    2.829787122239389
with rising costs , the danger is growing that the quality and risk dimension of the actual medical treatment will not be promoted with the same enthusiasm by those offering the service .    2.228864832565721
hospital audit does not only allow a check on the hospital ' s own situation with regard to performance , quality , efficiency and patient satisfaction , but can also provide a basis for structural planning .    2.452051095947802
the fact is that all efforts made and steps taken by the responsible persons in the hospital to improve the quality of structures , processes and results can only be successful if they are also perceived by the patients , the doctors who refer them and the UNK .    2.579595848151535
if hospital audit is restricted to the bed occupancy and the UNK data , it is only realistic to expect cuts in performance level .    2.5665162058492914
this would be bad for the patient and , in view of the consequent costs , also for the overall costs in the health care sector .    2.7936650350293957
against the backdrop of a future performance - related system of UNK instead of the principle of covering one ' s own costs that has been in place hitherto , openness about treatment results gains in importance as a competition parameter for qualified hospitals .    2.005702832657406
laparoscopic pelvic lymph node dissection was performed in 120 patients scheduled to undergo either radical perineal prostatectomy or radiation therapy .    2.5143033616906605
on average 13 lymph nodes were resected in each patient , and 21 patients were found to have metastatic disease in 1 - 9 lymph nodes .    2.4145493464642627
after an initial learning curve , mean operative time was reduced significantly , allowing laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical prostatectomy to be performed as a one - stage procedure .    2.455084364813392
the overall complication rate was 10 % ; open revisions were necessary in only 2 of 120 patients .    2.56618500751174
postoperative hospital stay was 2 days in patients undergoing laparoscopic lymph node dissection only .    2.750803326825684
this minimally invasive procedure is particularly beneficial to patients with lymph node metastases not undergoing radical prostatectomy , as well as to patients planned to be treated by radiation therapy .    2.7740812706575673
the combination of laparoscopic lymph node dissection and radical perineal prostatectomy avoids an abdominal incision and thus UNK both the hospital stay and the period of convalescence .    2.3221340640885457
taking the concepts of psychic structure and internal representation as an example , three different ways of relating psychoanalytic concepts to UNK are presented and discussed : the localizing , the metaphorical and the modelling relation .    2.055717063155021
the need is stressed not to mix up the different levels of description and explanation too early ; at the same time it is argued that - after the UNK of the old UNK - this way of relating offers a new chance to integrate neurobiological aspects in the concept of psychic structure without falling into the UNK of UNK UNK and UNK .    2.472613666501775
following augmentation of the upper extremity muscles necessitated by damage to the brachial plexus , special post - operative care programs are required to provide the patient with the best possible results .    2.723766670898723
proper care requires cooperation between the orthopedic surgeon , physical therapists and nurses .    2.2705820071296556
only then can postoperative rehabilitation and functional control of the extremity improve .    2.644542070691403
we describe interdisciplinary postoperative care programs for augmentation of the deltoid muscle with trapezius transfer , arthrodesis of the glenohumeral joint , biceps augmentation with the latissimus dorsi transfer , UNK UNK and augmentation of UNK / extensors muscles in the hand .    2.147143852513816
the prevalence of type i allergy against latex was investigated in dental students by questionnaire , prick tests and the determination of specific ige antibodies .    2.4426240091077474
positive prick tests against different latex fluids were found in 18 ( 8 . 7 % ) of 206 students , with clinical relevance in 11 cases .    2.756750601017203
when the total number of students in each semester was taken into account an increase in the minimal prevalence of clinically relevant latex allergy from 2 % in the second semester to 10 . 4 % in the tenth semester was seen .    2.7590236401104438
a history of UNK intolerance presenting as a UNK - and - flare reaction was associated with a type i allergy against latex in only 50 % of the affected subjects .    3.4059783310826104
atopic diseases and hand eczema of different causes proved to be risk factors in 16 and 5 of 18 students with latex allergy , respectively .    2.218333724714291
a high - ammonia accelerator - free latex fluid proved to be a very reliable test medium compared to the less sensitive determination of specific ige antibodies to latex .    2.5037341804483026
gastrointestinal obstruction is a frequently observed emergency with tumor patients .    2.3908674995019052
in addition to tumor relapse , the development of a second tumor or intraperitoneal tumor spreading , and benign alterations in advanced tumor stages ( radiogenic stenosis , adhesions ) may also be the cause for the obstruction .    2.379659307761122
the main objective of therapy is an attempt to eliminate the intestinal obstruction through surgery .    2.4933985225819293
if this is not possible because of advanced intra - abdominal tumor expansion , several endoscopic or interventional radiology methods , and drugs are available , that are used on an individual basis and based on prevailing experience to relieve the patient ' s condition .    2.207961915275964
the case of a 60 - year - old female patient with a supraglottic larynx carcinoma ( UNK ) and bilateral enlargement of the laryngeal sacculus is presented .    2.9377662231183432
the sacculus is a physiologic part of the roof of UNK ' s ventricle , the size of which can vary greatly .    2.95395109212767
these canal - like structures can be the point of origin of cysts , UNK , UNK , and UNK .    2.944179537706305
adverse effects of resuscitation due to closed - chest cardiac UNK are common , and the incidence is increased when an incorrect technique is used .    2.5577297480765715
nevertheless , thrombolytic therapy of a myocardial infarction can become necessary even after cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) .    2.3058738916176704
in these patients , the risk of thrombolytic therapy - induced bleeding is immanent .    3.6326526531185057
implantable cardioverter / defibrillators ( icd ) have led to a reduction in cardiac mortality in patients with ventricular tachyarrhythmias .    3.253401194357103
a considerable number of patients experience repeated shocks which may have an impact on the quality of life .    2.7702360968282838
an overview of the 30 years history and developement of documentation and information systems in the orthopedic university hospital heidelberg is presented .    2.110768065975742
since the foundation in 1967 four developmental phases can be described : first UNK of medical doctors , establishment of a basic documentation system for scientific purposes , strategic information system planning and realisation of information systems with the possibility of controlling in medical areas and thereby steering of the services .    2.0371260419550317
planning and realisation were accomplished within the framework of the UNK and concepts of the university clinics of the state of UNK - UNK .    3.3902251227222613
the treatment success of ncpap therapy ( nasal continuous positive airway pressure ) depends partly on the relief of symptoms and partly on long - term patient acceptance and the related avoidance of complications . nasal complaints constitute the most frequently reported side effects and , together with problems of mask application , are among the primary factors causing an ncpap - therapy to be prematurely discontinued .    2.167980506766743
the foramen ovale is anatomically open in 25 % of individuals , but functionally closed by the higher pressure in the left antrum .    2.4528879837607196
right - to - left shunt and subsequent paradoxical embolism may occur when pressure in the left antrum rises , for example , as a result of pulmonary embolism .    2.7937963808050195
in the present case we demonstrate a patient who presented 20 days after UNK treatment of a femoral fracture with word - finding deficits .    2.552879629317411
cerebral mrt revealed a fresh ischemic insult .    2.420215662481397
duplex ultrasound of the legs showed a fresh thrombosis of the superficial femoral vein and scintigraphy of the lungs detected pulmonary embolism .    2.3941022811454897
transesophageal contrast echocardiography trapped a hemodynamically spontaneous , open foramen ovale .    2.0843218741542335
duplex ultrasound of the carotid arteries detected no pathological findings .    2.4565070740037904
deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism can be clinically UNK and become manifest by cerebral deficits resulting from UNK embolism and cerebral ischemia .    2.2033878052170404
the diagnostic strategies in multiple trauma aim at rapid identification of life - threatening injuries , recognition of serious organ lesions , and evaluation of the systemic trauma impact , as well as the resulting host reaction .    2.466127840856101
besides improvements in the structure and organization , major innovations in imaging techniques have significantly improved and accelerated evaluation of the patient with multiple injuries in the emergency room .    2.9377881340999386
systematic diagnostic work - up , integrated multidisciplinary approach , and defined algorithms for traumatic key symptoms represent the hallmarks of successful emergency room management .    2.151093037165308
in particular , diagnostic work - up of injured body cavities using sonography and helical computed tomography are evaluated .    2.2928767771542953
pheochromocytomas are functionally active , catecholamine - secreting tumours of chromaffin tissue .    2.091414544072083
the mainstay of pharmacological therapy is preoperative treatment with oral phenoxybenzamine .    2.266597280666561
this drug irreversibly UNK alpha - 1 - adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle and renders them UNK , thereby causing vasodilatation .    2.1502376741801865
the duration of action of a single dose is approximately 24 h . therefore , postoperative hypotension is a hazard of therapy with phenoxybenzamine if adequate plasma volume repletion is not provided .    2.1543254755337036
UNK , a short - acting , competitive alpha - 1 blocker , has been used preoperatively , but has been criticized for its failure to adequately prevent perioperative hypertensive episodes .    2.4473956439413587
case report : case presentation of a 59 - year old female patient , who has been treated for her cancer by a physician of internal medicine with UNK acid .    2.414460194014011
for this therapy to be successful - according to the physician - all drugs especially the analgetics had to be stopped .    2.962446925936387
we present a case of primary plasmocytoma of the left upper bronchus .    2.7728597379890814
occlusion led to atelectasis of the left upper lobe and subsequent poststenotic pneumonia .    2.657797951318172
therapy consisted of local excision of the bronchus and postoperative radiotherapy .    2.761818678911066
this type of lung - conserving therapy in a case of primary plasmocytoma has not been described before .    3.0236690464746028
UNK male patients with a tentative diagnosis " UNK " were examined between november 1984 and december 1994 in the department of dermatology and UNK of the military hospital in ulm .    2.968430357149481
the patients , aged from 18 to 58 years ( mean age 24 . 1 years ) , were examined according to a standardized diagnostic procedure : .    2.8443896527108126
the use of the UNK - assessment battery for children ( k - abc ) was evaluated with a sample of 50 mentally disabled adults in a wide age range , as there exist no special tests for this group of patients .    2.508339166545909
as an assessment battery for children designed for the wide age range from 2 - 6 to 12 - 5 years is more adequate to the capability of UNK impaired adults , the k - abc delivers results on individual UNK and weaknesses , based on a neuropsychological theory .    2.1761052439776534
thus the individual cognitive abilities can be assessed with more differentiation , and that gives an important base for intervention , partial UNK , and placement .    2.3565160710325834
subject : using multi - slice computed tomography ( msct ) large body areas can scanned with high spatial resolution .    2.0238717645708557
in this study , msct was employed for virtual colonoscopy in various pathologies of the colon .    2.1795722242728344
in a regional quality assurance project for screening mammography ( german mammography study ) , 27 UNK women were screened in 40 participating , office - based mammography units from 1990 - 1992 .    1.8528481096247296
screening led to 317 biopsies with a positive predictive value of 0 . 33 .    2.8327868032858547
biopsy recommendations were acted upon in 29 % of cases within 2 weeks .    2.696692271959519
with the exception of the dignity mx physicians were incompletely informed about biopsy results .    2.054198437256049
the surgical procedure was known in the doctors ' offices in 62 % of the cases .    2.562267647453769
specimen UNK were not done regularly .    2.857829739839735
a pathology report was available overall in 42 of 106 malignant cases , respectively .    2.0599628411499906
only one third of the physicians received such reports routinely .    2.9597943769965305
fail - safe information are requested by mx physicians and can help them to better target biopsy recommendations .    2.0114576615023343
the high rate of recurrence after the treatment of adhesive obstruction demands special prophylactic treatment .    2.897501811738107
in a 13 - year period , 52 out of 95 patients with major adhesions were provided with a long nasointestinal tube for intestinal splinting intraoperatively .    2.2574857390739123
the was being left in situ on an average of 6 . 6 days .    2.926483291392408
after an observation period of at least 36 months a recurrence was seen in 2 of these 52 patients ( 3 . 9 % ; causes : volvulus after 6 months / fibrinous peritonitis on the 6th postoperative day ) .    2.489265959853133
amongst the 43 ' non - splinted ' patients , recurrence of adhesive obstruction was documented in 8 cases ( 18 . 6 % ; causes : adhesions after 0 . 3 - 136 . 9 months ) .    2.36861916944749
in the course of aftercare abdominal complaints were significantly fewer in patients who had been splinted .    2.6104417263744657
complications concerning the nasointestinal tubes did not occur .    2.319551323941719
the rate of perioperative complications was similar in both groups .    2.5638309601357814
minimally invasive cardiac surgery has been developed to offer patients the benefits of open heart operations with decreased pain and limited skin incision .    2.458131903734923
in this study , we report the results of minimally avr compared to the conventional method performed in the same period .    3.5547068598791345
from may 1996 to january 1998 , 86 patients received isolated aortic valve replacement by the limited superior median sternotomy ( group 1 ) .    2.2264050594232905
as a control group ( group 2 ) , 78 patients were enrolled who underwent isolated aortic valve replacements by standard sternotomy in the same period .    2.5965001449853626
av - synchrony and rate - responsive pacing are known as major factors to increase the maximum working capacity in patients with chronotropic incompetence .    2.4909127996428295
however , their importance throughout low - levels of exercise is poorly evaluated .    2.283550779098894
we studied 11 patients with implanted dual - chamber pacemakers ( UNK , meta UNK ) concerning oxygen uptake kinetics during serial treadmill exercise testing at a constant workload of 35 w ( UNK protocol ) .    2.094119383440337
each patient was tested in vvir - , ddd - , and dddr - mode .    2.603884152622653
all av delays were constant at UNK .    2.3913817388946743
the oxygen deficit ( o2d ) , mean response time ( mrt ) for oxygen uptake , and a oxygen deficit index ( o2di ) were determined .    2.345356430652074
in addition , the heart rate ( hr ) and UNK were monitored .    3.091588035840345
results : significant differences ( p < 0 . 01 ) were observed in hr and o2d when comparing both ddd - to vvir - and ddd - to dddr - modes .    2.1505194556609544
comparing the randomly synchronous vvir - to the dddr - mode , only the mrt of oxygen uptake demonstrated a significant decrease in the dddr - mode ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.149995830284545
there were also significant decreases in o2di and mrt in the dddr - mode , as compared to the non - rate responsive ddd - mode ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.2874585543537753
stress testing in pm patients with an appropriate chronotropic response to low intensity exercise UNK that av synchrony is of much less influence on oxygen uptake kinetics than the rate - adaptive pacing .    1.9909292356738435
purpose : this paper discusses the role of different imaging modalities in the diagnostic work - up of crohn ' s disease ( cd ) .    3.04135960812549
introduction : results of animal experiments have demonstrated that the osseous integration of non - cemented prostheses can , at the very least temporarily , be impaired by the application of non - steroidal antiphlogistic agents ( such as diclofenac ) .    2.386531758986829
it is the objective of this study to examine whether there is a direct influence of diclofenac used in usual clinical dosages ( 3 times 50 mg daily ) on bone cells and their progenitor cells which would explain the observed slow integration of the prostheses .    2.33944628564468
methods : to investigate this , cultivated human in vitro osteoblasts and stromal bone marrow cells were incubated with increasing doses of the medications .    2.1468917483379726
our study focused on the effect of diclofenac application on proliferation and functional metabolism in both cell lines .    2.408562410088971
this correlated with diclofenac concentrations between 1 and 10 ml found in our experiments .    2.212204515409586
the detected values were correlated to the control group ( 0 µg / ml diclofenac ) .    2.8047823622106494
results : the drug effect upon osteoblasts was higher than on progenitor cells .    2.204253510483541
the proliferation of in vitro stromal bone marrow cells , compared to untreated cells , was found to be decreased .    2.7816082151489834
we observed a decrease to 82 % at a diclofenac concentration of 1 µg / ml , osteoblasts exhibited a decrease to 97 , 5 % at the same concentration .    2.504850856991315
the dna synthesis increased to 118 % in stromal bone marrow cells , in osteoblasts to 144 % .    2.0324224449258836
in contrast , we detected a UNK decrease to 92 % in the collagen synthesis of osteoblasts compared to untreated cells .    2.2570181931242215
the synthesis of osteocalcin by osteoblasts increased to 119 % .    2.1856775929150376
the alkaline phosphatase activity was found to be decreased to 88 % in stromal bone marrow cells and increased in osteoblasts to 111 % .    2.1936644283105178
conclusion : temporary inhibiting effects on osseous integration in non - cemented prosthesis by diclofenac could be caused by a disturbance in the anabolic bone metabolism , exhibited by an increase of osteoblastic osteocalcin expression .    2.3198093836228404
osteocalcin as a known negative regulator of the UNK is most likely inhibiting the collagen matrix deposition .    2.7481347920471055
recent investigations have controversially but convincingly interpreted the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis ( arteriosclerosis ) .    2.3790848799175617
the main arguments for chlamydial genesis are : correlation of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic diseases and antibodies against chlamydia pneumoniae .    2.19901245167711
( 2 ) chlamydia pneumoniae could be detected with different techniques ( pcr , icc , UNK , UNK , culture ) in a high percentage of UNK from different sites .    2.931122704303974
( 3 ) according to three successful international studies with UNK in coronary heart disease .    2.6685015716334766
( 4 ) target cells of atherosclerosis ( UNK , macrophages , muscle cells ) can be infected by chlamydia pneumoniae in vitro .    2.725125960492074
( 5 ) provocation of UNK in animal experiments .    3.258129954883432
( 6 ) the reduction of incidence of atherosclerotic diseases since the 1960s , probably due to advances in antibiotic treatment .    2.378257967955256
( 7 ) elevated levels of acute - phase proteins and other inflammatory signs ( crp , UNK count , UNK ) briefly before cardiac infarction occurs .    2.393336237982693
there are good arguments for intervention studies in coronary heart disease and other manifestations of atherosclerosis .    2.374297506664865
the relevant antibiotics are available for chlamydial infections and are inexpensive and safe .    2.454503719858097
meticulous protocols and long - term monitoring of patients should be developed .    3.191799845703454
the pre - and postoperative symptoms of zygomatic bone fractures were examined in a follow - up study to prepare a classification proposal .    2.8007172212000992
a differential indication for minimally invasive therapy modes was looked for with respect to this proposal .    2.5229541846880292
the aims of this study were clinical and radiological assessment of the repositioning result in terms of aesthetics and stability and quantification of the postoperative remission of disturbances of sensitivity of the infraorbital nerve .    2.8857298912174527
a total of 52 patients were examined .    2.9984773060225014
after the operation ( on average after 3 . 5 days following the trauma ) they were followed - up postoperatively for 12 months according to a strict schedule .    2.5952937354356096
other symptoms , such as periorbital haematoma and flattening of the zygomatic UNK , were observed in 49 patients and 45 patients , respectively .    2.7201796663191598
all fractures were repositioned well as assessed clinically and radiologically .    2.5338766359025326
the aesthetic result was evaluated as symmetric and durable in all cases .    2.3554611668364953
six months postoperatively 41 patients reported normal sensitivity in the area of the infraorbital nerve .    2.3185269921320497
in only five patients ( 10 . 2 % ) was the sensitivity loss persistent throughout the entire follow - up period .    2.8649175941735856
patients with primarily lacking diplopia developed neither eye motility disturbances nor postoperative UNK in the following period .    2.487211553806892
it can be concluded that the treatment of an isolated zygomatic bone fracture which UNK aesthetic and functional requirements is possible by reposition and fixation with one miniplate at the lateral orbital rim .    2.362816880977883
an additional osteosynthesis at the infraorbital rim or at the UNK crista is not necessary .    2.501383978028412
a routine revision of the orbital floor is only indicated in cases of preoperative diplopia .    2.88932148137101
a zygomatic bone fracture connected with diplopia should be classified as combined zygomatic - / orbital floor fracture .    2.1366124564941416
chronic primary headache has a considerable impact on the quality of life .    2.668888796273584
to date , this impact has been evaluated by measurements of the general pain specific impairment of the quality of life .    2.5370006222583923
headache specific measurements of quality of life or of disability caused by the headache are still missing for the german language .    2.8783842857723028
in america , a headache specific questionnaire , the " headache disability inventory " ( UNK ) , has been evaluated which is used in the presented study to create a german version , the " UNK zur UNK UNK UNK " ( ibk ) .    3.0294945984583155
cronbach ' s alpha was a = 0 . 90 , the test - retest - reliability after three months was r = 0 . 87 .    2.5536403914011983
an analysis of subscales for emotional and functional disability showed similar values for the internal consistency and the test - retest - reliability of these subscales .    2.061802770211078
the scores of the different headache types did not differ significantly .    2.9131829928357065
in post - hoc - analyses , however , cluster headache showed higher disability scores than migraine both in the total scale and in the subscales .    2.50390434538271
the total score of the ibk was significantly correlated with the number of headache days per month ( r = 0 . 41 ; p < 0 . 0003 ) but not with the duration of disease or other demographic parameters .    2.610305858591099
the ibk is the first german headache specific measurement of certain aspects of the quality of life in chronic headache patients .    2.8147113602519482
it can be used in clinical settings to evaluate the current state of the patient or to monitor treatment and it can be used for scientific studies .    3.6302382507158333
age and menstrual cycle have an important influence on the breast .    2.997829760992752
this well - known fact is experienced in the daily routine of gynecologists and radiologists .    2.469850743105573
the number of publications UNK the effect of these influences on imaging , however , is surprisingly low .    2.9502877396477287
the aim of this work is to describe the influences of age and menstrual cycle on the breast and to address their clinical relevance for mammography and mr mammography .    2.1844261265512035
therefore , own data are presented concerning the age and menstrual cycle influences on breast parenchyma in dynamic mr mammography .    2.098439029987253
literature data are used to correlate mammography and mr imaging findings with these influences .    2.643822563333557
the changes of the breast due to age and menstrual cycle have important direct implications on performing and reading conventional mammography and mr mammography .    2.270379856137085
the knowledge of these changes is also helpful in the interpretation of findings when comparing different methods .    2.571303259255383
finally , the data gained by using imaging methods enable important basic insights into physiology and physiopathology of the breast in vivo .    2.1673764312331287
as part of our neonatal screening program we applied tandem mass spectrometry on 128 . 225 dried blood samples for detection of inborn errors of metabolism .    2.0085121051592254
appendectomy is one of the most frequent surgical procedures .    3.060512633117557
accuracy in the clinical diagnosis of acute non - specific appendicitis , however , suffers from the fact that the symptoms and clinical findings of acute appendicitis can be UNK by many other abdominal diseases .    3.2783462176197586
the clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis , therefore , can only be definitely confirmed by UNK analysis , the criteria of which are reviewed in this paper .    3.061907122300771
extra - articular interventions by osteotomies to correct the axial malpositioning of the joint ( genu varum or valgum ) are treatments proven over many years .    2.0684501751434374
unfortunately a uniform critical examination is lacking because the investigators used no scores .    2.076055808911209
the good results by infra - and supracondylar osteotomies - some of them for 15 years and more - have to be achieved by prosthesis first .    2.4406106576108533
the important facts for gonarthrosis of the knee joint are the axial malpositioning , the miss load , and the instability of the joint ; these facts are the cause for the complaints and for the restriction of functional efficiency .    2.544722837055459
therefore , indication of infra - or supracondylar osteotomies is not limited by the age of the patient .    2.426281796481265
the most important fact is the condition of the joint , especially the quality of bone , the instability of the joint , and the loss of bone .    3.8919340851462825
given the right indication , the treatment of genu varum and valgum by osteotomies is an important factor in preserving the joint .    2.5798134338181953
also , there are still chances to do another operation , such a prothesis .    2.6299407348931316
psychic trauma may be followed by a variety of unpredictable reactions by the subject , which differ individually and are dependant upon the situation .    2.42355947855181
differentiation between psychic crises and psychiatric emergency situations ( pes ) is often difficult as the first might proceed into the second and definitions of the two tend to UNK .    2.3800991991559584
this article aims to overview the different psychic and psychiatric disturbances which are relevant in preclinical emergency medicine .    1.9939041485635192
for the most important disturbances and syndromes the differential diagnostic procedures and therapeutic strategies are presented .    3.105320376336885
acute pancreatitis is a UNK entity with rather diverse clinical courses .    2.735410015479016
whereas edematous pancreatitis has a mortality of less than 1 % , nowadays ; still approximately 20 % of all patients with the necrotizing form UNK to the disease .    3.0606394923226286
to further improve therapeutic results a standardized approach should be used .    2.584306379537652
all patients with signs of pancreatic necroses during abdominal ultrasound and patients with organ insufficiencies should undergo a ct - scan to define exactly the nature and the extent of the disease .    2.423969971858232
primarily all patients are treated conservatively .    3.250769475774133
main indications for operative intervention are signs for infection of pancreatic necroses and an acute abdomen due to local complications of acute pancreatitis .    2.240789343431626
in cases of biliary origin an elective cholecystectomy has to be performed during a free interval to prevent a recurrence .    2.580169609408982
objective : diagnosis of osteomyelitis is difficult in early state of disease .    2.3307894100811954
usually , characteristic x - ray findings cannot be obtained during the first week of disease .    2.9997007000317173
sonography , scintigraphy and magnetic resonance tomography were compared at clinical manifestation of osteomyelitis .    2.551240216498871
a 73 - year old female patient is known to have hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy ( hocm ) since 1989 .    2.6299728573920405
after a transmural anterolateral myocardial infarction with the development of a large apical UNK of the anterior wall , a previously measured gradient of 11 mm hg in the UNK is no longer detected .    3.217821385328579
as a consequence of this UNK , " pseudo - UNK " caused by myocardial as an example of an uncommon spontaneous course of hocm .    2.5945801353604976
aim : intensified insulin therapy is the therapy of choice for patients with diabetes type i .    3.0288275662067243
intensified insulin therapy includes an basis - bolus insulin injection regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion , several times daily blood glucose self - monitoring , self - adaptation of insulin dosages by the patients themselves and a far - reaching UNK of nutrition .    1.8721696889217674
the patients learn UNK of diabetes therapy in a structured treatment and teaching program .    2.291779168875599
the effectivity of this program is evaluated in the routine care .    2.777561514978969
the treatment of idiopathic scoliosis over 40 ° ( cobb ) during the growth period is under discussion concerning the indication for conservative or surgical treatment .    2.432708450558799
curve progression depends on the degree of the frontal and sagittal deformity , vertebral rotation , rigidity of the curve , the skeletal age , the age and sex of the patient , the familial frequency of scoliosis and the location of the curve .    2.5540582831139553
in scoliosis over 40 ° progression is fast and the possibilities for successful conservative brace treatment are reduced during the growth period .    2.13238413998806
progression occurs more frequently in thoracic and double major UNK , especially in young patients ( UNK sign 0 and 1 ) .    2.7221705952951
the purpose of this study was to evaluate low - field magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) with an open system and to correlate results obtained with the experience of the radiologist .    2.6253776948072716
between august 1995 and may 1997 , 75 patients at the UNK UNK , mainz , germany , with an acute trauma of the knee joint were operated on arthroscopically after clinical examination , x - ray and mri imaging .    3.225827712615936
mri analysis was performed by two independent radiologists with varying mri experience without knowledge of the patient ' s history .    2.8845699749440277
the sensitivity and specifity of the more [ u1 ] and the less experienced [ u2 ] radiologist ranged from 83 to 100 % ( u1 ) and from 61 to 100 % ( u2 ) .    2.026661534550636
positive and negative predictive value ranged from 83 to 100 % ( u1 ) and from 58 to 100 % ( u2 ) ; accuracy ranged from 92 to 100 % ( u1 ) and from 77 to 100 % ( u1 ) .    1.8881154360175176
we conclude that the results of low - field mri are comparable with those of high - field mri and that differences in the results of the experienced and less experienced radiologist can be established .    3.1647315563778036
in intervention trials it was without exception possible to influence the development of atherosclerosis by a reduction of the ldl - cholesterol and an increase in hdl - cholesterol and to reduce complications like myocardial infarction , sudden cardiac death , angina or heart failure .    2.6706084867041233
changes of lifestyle can be effective , but are rarely accepted and are difficult to communicate .    2.433019680337515
dermatosurgery has been gaining in importance in recent years .    2.391427800258628
in departments of dermatology german - speaking countries the total number of operations increased by 58 % from 1984 to 1991 .    2.3813986324199434
the increase in the number of operations of moderate and extreme severity was especially marked .    2.710269595968264
out - patient dermatosurgery was also performed mainly by dermatologists as opposed to other specialties .    2.2242972024819094
from 1988 to 1992 dermatologists in private practice recorded an increase of 40 . 6 % in the number of operative procedures they performed .    3.2517679589774424
the importance of dermatosurgery in hospital and private practice can be expected to continue increasing in the future ; dermatologists must therefore prepare themselves for the present and future challenges inherent in surgery of the skin .    2.37731528430506
there is evidence that diastolic function is a major determinant of overall cardiac performance .    2.2549134322210502
intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) enables doppler measurement of mitral UNK pattern ( e / a ratio ) .    2.0636806256581224
the e / a ratio is suggested to be a reliable index of changes in myocardial relaxation .    2.4830300182888143
in the present study we compared the time course of the e / a ratio and the time constant of myocardial relaxation ( ) assessed by direct left ventricular pressure recordings in patients before and after cardiopulmonary bypass ( cpb ) .    2.2787808093228903
after ethical approval , 12 patients undergoing cabg surgery were studied .    2.4071374534572603
measurements of the e / a ratio and were performed after induction of anesthesia ( i ) , immediately prior to cpb with the pericardium open ( ii ) , 5 min after cpb ( iii ) , and after sternal closure ( iv ) .    2.6531157220360027
time constant of myocardial relaxation was calculated as the reciprocal value of the slope of the left ventricular dp / UNK and left ventricular pressure UNK .    2.6808947181446947
the e / a ratio was significantly decreased at the end of surgery ( iv ) .    2.45391618289655
cardiac index and heart rate both increased after cpb .    2.7058431975341506
the results of the present study demonstrate that diastolic dysfunction occurred immediately after cpb , as indicated by an increase in the time constant of myocardial relaxation .    2.5931604098059338
however , improved rapidly to pre - cpb values .    2.3670473742175093
the e / a ratio alone failed to detect the initial post - cpb alteration in left ventricular relaxation .    2.040424234355502
acute exercise is followed by a mobilization of white blood cells , mainly induced by increased levels of catecholamines and cortisol .    2.2353101658407577
nk - cells react the most intensive , they can increase UNK after intensive exercise .    2.2006289284429252
additionally a weak acute - phase reaction occurs .    2.4164016640047934
most of these changes normalize during twenty - four hours .    2.504375512874856
parameters of the humoral immune system may be different from the pre - exercise levels up to seventy - two hours .    2.5449521812676843
repeated physical exercise , which is typical for sports , is followed only by small changes of immunologic parameters under conditions of rest .    2.323536137042577
epidemiological studies give clues that the rate of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes can be described by a j - shaped curve .    2.4422270706396256
moderately active subjects have the lowest rate of infection .    2.4675180652589432
for this influence of exercise on health mainly functional changes seem to be important .    2.516466371331111
especially after UNK exercise immunological cells can be seen in the muscle tissue , which remove destructed tissue .    2.6024524291232383
not very much is known about the role of the immune system in the regeneration of tendons and other bradytrophic tissues .    2.668328919547234
to achieve septoplasty without compromising the surgical goal of UNK a straight and solid septum , even in cases of marked deviations or severe post - traumatic deformities , we now use a new technique in which the septal reconstruction includes the placement of a resorbable implant as a " compound graft " .    2.441348359756568
for this purpose the entire septal cartilage is removed , and the severely deviated part is divided into straight sections that are UNK to each other to form a straight and solid plate .    2.2706126672359326
as connecting material we use a polydioxanon ( pds ) foil .    2.1921355739185038
the sections of cartilage are sutured to the foil with pds suture material .    2.071596082003421
the compound graft thus constructed consists of the septal cartilage and resorbable alloplastic material and is reimplanted into the nose .    2.139457003424797
the pds and suture material are usually resorbed within 8 months , excluding long - term complications .    2.334721304911712
during the past 2 years this method was used in treating 38 patients .    2.669770852886997
the surgical goal was attained in every case , and no immediate or long - term complications occurred .    2.7850640935324615
this method of combining septal cartilage with a resorbable implant leads to a better , significant correction of even severe septal deviations .    2.2758866525760517
two types of corticosteroid receptors have been identified in the brain and pituitary that play an important role in the regulation of the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenocortical ( hpa ) axis .    2.1880849172126666
these glucocorticoid hormone binding receptors are the UNK receptor ( mr ) and the glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) .    2.442585127964408
UNK , a tight control of the concentration and function of these receptors is of prime importance for maintaining and regaining homeostasis after stressful challenges .    2.315006087220476
here , we describe a novel mechanism revealing a rapid UNK in mr density in the hippocampus ( a limbic structure highly involved in hpa axis regulation ) after an acute psychologically stressful challenge .    1.9886691208469367
thus , an acute stressful experience results in a reorganization of the hpa axis involving a principal role of the hippocampal mr .    2.2251657339846087
this novel mechanism may be of significance for increasing our understanding of the etiology of stress - related disorders .    2.8804983711707557
the wide variety of therapeutic effects make neuroleptics potent drugs in the treatment of pain .    2.9547834687619825
until now there has been no proof of their analgesic potency ; in spite of this fact , neuroleptics are used to treat chronic pain states on the assumption that they do have analgesic potency .    2.5032699425419205
a metaanalysis was performed and 48 publications reviewed .    2.6968024443485428
thirty - four , the majority of the studies , are case reports , retrospective analyses or non - randomised cohort studies .    2.6384960334886376
most of these reports UNK to a positive effect .    2.927522039336101
however , only ten out of fifteen studies with a higher statistical study power describe a possible analgesic effect .    2.083534105335475
none of the studies could differentiate between the effects of analgesia and sedation of the drugs used .    2.6567116656613505
the metaanalysis provides no evidence of intrinsic analgesic properties of neuroleptics for their use as adjuvant analgesics .    2.134061765156739
studies into the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke have indicated that treatment options are likely to be optimised when early signs of stroke are recognised and treatment is initiated within 3 hours from symptom onset .    2.2306201928950435
for most patients there is a long delay between the onset of symptoms and the start of therapy .    3.0915338541408253
many factors are responsible for this time delay : signs and symptoms often go unrecognised by patients , relatives and UNK and stroke is not given a high priority by medical staff .    2.2431676665357005
although a small number of stroke patients is treated as emergency and attended to by the emergency medical services within this time window , this number could easily be increased by intensified public and emergency personnel education .    2.179690359874029
for the future , we hope that emergency medical services ( ems ) will be able to initiate therapies which must be administered within the first few hours of acute stroke .    2.2805060881332415
standard of care by the ems personnel includes maintenance of oxygenation , treatment of cardiac arrhythmia and hypertension as well as hyperglycemia and hyperthermia .    2.6826485989801725
early notification by the emergency medical services about stroke patients would enable stroke teams to be present at admission , thus improving the likelihood of a better outcome for patients .    2.1377801179329374
a decrease in compliance of the ascending aorta caused by prosthetic replacement or " wrapping " may lead to a partial loss of the arterial UNK - function .    2.726353304933284
the following study investigated the effects of this intervention on aortic input impedance .    2.7586123202720527
in 8 pigs , the wall of the ascending aorta was wrapped with a prosthesis .    2.59142332729233
this approach was chosen to minimize additional influence of extended operative procedures on the ascending aorta , like extracorporal circulation , cardioplegia or blood loss .    2.2054427016728857
flow and pressure were recorded before and after the intervention , and following fourier transformation , the aortic input impedance was calculated .    2.467768934399342
mean pressure , mean flow , and total peripheral resistance were unaltered , while there was a significant increase in blood pressure amplitude and characteristic impedance in response to the " wrapping " procedure .    2.4361735390727834
thus , it becomes obvious that even the loss of elastic properties of the ascending aorta only leads to an increase of left ventricular load .    2.8776554525714277
cervical UNK are widespread diseases in otorhinolaryngology .    2.64208936432045
there are many differential diagnoses which have to be considered when swelling persists .    2.879686882692534
to gain further information it is advisable to perform sonographically controlled fine needle aspiration biopsy ( fnp ) .    2.0508953401134673
if there is no reliable result , it is necessary to remove a lymph node .    3.0128130812834595
we report on the rare case of isolated histiocytosis x in lymph nodes .    2.436571303329274
a 63 - year - old male had noticed a swelling of the right side of the neck about 6 weeks previously .    2.7911016846164807
the preliminary examinations ( fnp / blood examinations ) revealed no pathological findings .    2.082928713818178
only the histological examination delivered the diagnosis of histiocytosis x .    3.1464724082729227
systemic manifestation was excluded by staging examinations .    2.4586005085748903
no further therapy was necessary after lymph node extirpation .    2.404428371569141
the report demonstrates how to diagnose and treat this rare disease .    2.327916181867875
we report our preliminary results using a new magnetic resonance imaging technique for visualization of the urinary tract .    2.8444138101624437
using the paramagnetic contrast medium gadolinium UNK UNK UNK - acetic acid ( dtpa ) , we were able to obtain images of the urinary tract comparable to those obtained by conventional excretory urography .    2.5847693022791245
the major advantage of our technique is that besides good morphologic visualization , the excretion of gadolinium - dtpa can be studied simultaneously .    1.9825322760821935
we demonstrate our preliminary results in selected cases .    2.5787825854938844
microcallus formations are demonstrable in nearly all cancellous bones by means of suitable preparation techniques .    2.450161660849375
histologically , these structures are immature fibrous bone formed in local UNK parts of the trabeculae .    2.2269804064912844
using a preparation technique that allows combined two - and UNK analysis , 26 normal human spines and 11 osteoporotic spines were investigated for microcallus .    2.2182353920533293
microcallus formations occur frequently in people over 45 years of age .    2.280983358734545
they are mainly localized in the lower thoracic and lumbar spine and occur significantly more frequent in females than in males .    2.4849076680315214
the number of microcallus formations depends more on the UNK of the cancellous bone than on individual trabecular parameters .    2.673242066954427
in about 33 % of cases UNK are demonstrable in the centre of the microcallus formation .    2.728593698575508
in noninvasive studies the bone mass could be misinterpreted due to microcallus .    2.12101488440223
although it indicates instability of the bone structure , microcallus formation is not a purely negative mechanism .    2.768686487283248
it stabilizes and UNK the bone tissue .    3.088773472865303
furthermore , complete new trabeculae can be formed due to bridges of microcallus between residual trabeculae .    1.8982773450398522
osteoporosis is not the result of an inability to form microcallus .    2.9323907931874467
dna cytometric investigations of intraosseous cystic lesions and osteoblastic tumors may be helpful in morphological diagnosis .    2.2836256395221843
the detection of a dna - aneuploid stemline supports the diagnosis of a high - grade malignant bone neoplasm , even in small biopsies .    3.249602773151088
solitary and aneurysmal bone cysts have dna - diploid cell populations .    2.3840451451319846
low - grade central osteosarcomas may show single - cell UNK of varying extent as well as a dna - diploid stemline .    2.8607429591224025
their presence may be a sign of genetic instability within the population of neoplastic cells before a dna - aneuploid stemline is established and should prompt careful postoperative observation .    2.1937893293765116
although noise in general can induce hearing loss , environmental noise represents an important risk for children , teenagers and young adults .    2.272224975895332
epidemiological investigations now support the occurrence of an increasing number of irreversible hearing losses in these groups .    2.6341306259731496
major causes of hearing loss are toys ( UNK ) , UNK and UNK amplified music delivered by head sets or UNK in UNK and open air UNK .    3.0153135479529793
the development of arthroscopic wrist surgery has helped to understand the anatomy and pathology of the wrist joint .    2.5860168328113824
one of the most important functions of the arthroscopic inspection in the radiocarpal and UNK joints is the evaluation of the wrist stability .    2.9306437657639943
state of the art in the hand surgery today includes a combination of arthroscopic and arthroscopic assisted operations .    2.7307214436691005
the arthroscopy of the wrist offers significant information independent from the standard radiological diagnostic tools .    2.543078291815466
UNK lesions and scapholunate dissociation remain to be the most common causes for arthroscopic wrist surgery .    2.9031328931775247
wernicke ' s encephalopathy ( we ) is a consequence of vitamin b1 ( thiamine ) deficiency and in the majority of cases due to alcoholism .    2.67245945029229
we report here the case of a 26 - year - old male alcoholic who had stayed UNK at home for 4 days until hospital admission .    2.3443280945903746
clinical diagnosis was difficult due to major disturbance of consciousness .    2.4346361652622606
mri showed an increase in signal intensity ( t2 - , flair - weighted ) around the third ventricle , the UNK bodies , the UNK , the UNK bodies , the floor of the fourth ventricle and around the UNK .    2.808443872083137
these findings were indicative of we although of unusual extent .    2.227876372664999
in this case mri correlated well with clinical symptomatology .    2.345681950535286
therapy with thiamine was started immediately and symptoms as well as mri findings resolved partially .    2.7446044211370517
the presented case illustrates the diagnostic usefulness of mri in we especially if the patient is of reduced consciousness and clinical investigation is limited .    2.3792536322285964
background : UNK UNK examination after the extraction of choroidal UNK membranes ( cnv ) in age - related macular degeneration ( UNK ) shows absolute UNK in the area of pigment epithelial loss .    2.6038455959578695
laser treatment also causes complete functional loss .    2.3671209050059145
the functional results of these two methods should be compared before the surgical procedure is expanded .    3.0365636776141236
three case reports of a UNK and an UNK vascular proliferation of the synovial membrane as rare aseptic complications of unicompartmental knee arthroplasty are presented .    2.810314700803677
neither complication can be confirmed by clinical examination , laboratory findings or diagnostic imaging techniques .    2.728687447365005
arthroscopy of the knee joint permits both diagnostic evaluation and low - risk surgical treatment .    2.8336799580304954
strabismus surgery in children is associated with a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting ( ponv ) .    3.0430968976879007
we report on a case of a 23 years old man who was polytraumatized in a car accident .    2.417039009521345
he survived with excellent clinical outcome , but after 113 days after the accident he collapsed , massive bleeding out of the UNK started and the patient died within a few minutes .    2.9903742274254883
a gastric ulcer bleeding was assumed , but autopsy showed the UNK - in of a posttraumatic aortic aneurysm into the esophagus .    2.2452886047781404
the difficulties of in time diagnosis of thoracic aorta lesions are discussed .    2.226858056210225
the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of oral leukoplakia ( ol ) in hiv - positive patients and to evaluate the clinical and histopathological features and the presence of candida hyphae and viral infections ( hsv 1 , 2 , hpv , ebv and cmv ) by immunocytochemical methods using mono - or polyclonal antibodies .    2.272060648111313
a total of 269 hiv - seropositive patients , ( 222 men , median age 36 . 7 years and 47 women , median age 32 years ) were registered .    2.3347502346232445
ol occurred in 20 / 269 ( 7 . 4 % ) patients ( men , smokers , median age 38 years ) ; the non - homogeneous form was observed in 11 % .    2.7210042247889383
a lesional biopsy specimen was obtained from 8 / 20 patients .    2.3326017228438567
specimens did not show signs of epithelial dysplasia .    2.724028831900615
candida hyphae were evident in 2 / 8 cases .    2.6005506342381572
two patients tested positive for hpv and cmv ; antibodies against ebv , UNK and 2 were negative .    2.398983572983753
in conclusion , the prevalence of ol is comparatively high in this group of hiv - seropositive patients ( 7 . 4 % vs . 0 . 9 - 2 . 2 % ) .    3.1247826223683037
moreover , the mean age of the study group at the time of diagnosis for ol was lower ( 38 years vs . 60 years ) .    2.9415360958833126
damage / dysfunctioning of the heart forms part of the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome ( mods ) in sepsis and sirs .    2.603777578170205
this acute septic cardiomyopathy is often underestimated in degree and relevance , although about 10 % of all sepsis fatalities are due to intractable heart failure .    2.3571952344203364
this potentially reversible cardiomyopathy is characterized by a considerable pump failure , not primarily ischemic , with coronary blood flow being normal or even enhanced ; the left and right ventricle is enlarged as a consequence of an increased ventricular compliance .    2.058104410402646
damage of the heart can further be aggravated in case of additional right ventricular impairment due to pulmonary hypertension in ards .    2.617768260781499
sirs - cardiomyopathy in non - infectious mods has common traits with acute septic cardiomyopathy .    2.564425940473704
the pathogenesis of heart disease in sepsis and sirs is multifactorial , the endotoxin / tnf / no / cgmp - cascade representing a main negative inotropic axis .    1.9840568851024136
therapy of acute septic cardiomyopathy and sirs - cardiomyopathy at present is still mainly symptomatic ( volume substitution , inotropic / vasoactive agents ) ; causal therapeutic principles are , however , put to test in the context of a comprehensive concept of causal sepsis treatment .    2.155433205818541
fractures of the distal metaphysis of the tibia often include an extension into the ankle .    2.631604915934743
intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis should reduce the high incidence of soft tissue and ankle problems and should be an alternative to open plate fixation , with good ultimate functional outcome .    2.5715501994539376
between january 1993 and december 1995 , a prospective study on 49 patients with distal metaphyseal tibia fracture and involvement of the ankle was performed .    2.655397089277281
all the fractures were treated with intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw osteosynthesis , and plate fixation in cases of fibula fractures .    2.758818938226266
there were 27 men and 22 women with an average age of 46 . 4 + / - 12 . 7 years ( range 21 - 90 ) .    2.7591420383466776
in most studies of the use of intramedullary nailing in distal tibial fractures the classification has been inadequate .    2.5269511353867555
therefore a new classification according to robinson et al .    2.450563397804762
( 1995 ) was used : 10 fractures were type ii b ( 20 . 4 % ) , 13 were type ii c ( 26 . 5 % ) , and 26 patients suffered a combination of type ii b and type ii c ( 53 . 1 % ) .    2.8513248821611104
this fracture type was defined as type ii d for use in this study .    2.664049412436787
the severity of soft tissue injury was recorded using the gustilo system in case of open ( n = 19 ) and the UNK system in case of closed fractures ( n = 30 ) .    3.3563538215242876
in 31 patients distal tibia fracture was accompanied by a fracture of the fibula , which was first UNK using a plate .    2.829051795418378
for reconstruction of the distal articular surface , covered screw osteosynthesis was done .    3.0765031221729227
at the next step intramedullary nails were inserted and were statically locked proximally and distally .    2.1131800057308148
from january 1993 to february 1994 , the reamed ao standard nail was used .    2.0801443273143705
after introduction of the unreamed tibial nail ( utn ) all fractures were treated by this implant .    2.6743907796524002
full load on the operated leg was allowed after 8 weeks .    2.578412529341633
union of the fracture was assessed by standard radiological and clinical criteria .    3.195913086340055
UNK was defined as more than 5 ° of angular rotation .    2.8055484705982647
further surgery due to a valgus deformity in the ankle joint had to be done in three cases .    3.2078161941584074
there were no deep infections .    2.5687923047147136
three patients had a superficial infection in the ankle area , but surgical debridement was not necessary .    2.7516084180059837
a leg shortening was found in 4 cases , but it was less than 1 cm in every case .    3.2347215096154582
therefore , surgical correction was not done .    2.515598342892565
patients were reviewed at intervals of 2 , 6 , and 12 weeks , and after 6 , and at least 12 months .    3.269183873257756
all 49 patients were finally reviewed after an average time of 15 . 7 months ( range 12 - 38 ) .    2.6783536023238237
bone fusion was reached 12 . 8 weeks ( range 9 - 21 ) after the operative treatment .    2.666148698530698
a specific assessment of the ankle symptoms was made using the score of olerud and molander ( 1984 ) .    2.5334583444087713
in 29 patients excellent results were recorded .    2.622210381147824
a satisfactory result was attained with 17 patients and just 3 patients were found to be unsatisfactory .    2.440239669598136
although proximity of distal tibia fracture to the ankle makes the treatment more complicated than for fractures of the tibial diaphysis , closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a good alternative to open reduction and plate fixation .    2.2287399787366513
the major advantages are closed procedure and simplified interlocking techniques .    2.202621617831197
therefore , closed intramedullary nailing combined with covered screw fixation is a safe and effective method of managing this type of fracture .    2.375096438191171
laryngeal candidiasis is very rare in the absence of other more proximal diseases in the aerodigestive tract .    2.592309636894268
the lesion shows UNK hyperplasia or acanthosis and , given its rarity , may be confused with cancer .    2.317574530706106
in the present paper we report on a 56 - year - old male patient who presented with UNK .    2.8237565084052494
physical examination of the larynx revealed a hyperplastic lesion involving both vocal cords .    2.5930506692100495
the clinical aspect and the risk factor profile of the patient ( ten UNK of UNK and 40 UNK per day ) generated the clinical diagnosis of laryngeal cancer .    3.0780859092908854
the histopathological examination of the specimen excluded a squamous cell carcinoma ; however , it could not provide a clear diagnosis .    2.966176692431696
laryngeal papillomatosis and tuberculosis , which had been suspected , could be excluded .    2.652233129521064
as the lesion progressed , further biopsies led to the diagnosis of candidiasis .    2.8442639655977433
lymphatic spread of bronchial carcinoma can reach any part of the mediastinum , irrespective of the localisation of the primary tumor .    2.697357644143108
metastatic spread may not affect al topographical lymph node positions , but this is unpredictable .    2.239499232134209
the number of lymph nodes in each position varies .    2.6343394133573086
therefore , systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection includes all ipsilateral compartments of the mediastinum .    2.256452187580536
it is also possible to reach contralateral sites .    2.7474977224103885
in right - sided UNK the lymph node dissection is standardized .    2.995541750157198
UNK the aortic arch and the large vessels also allows complete mediastinal dissection by a left - sided approach .    2.2575954668127345
the surgical technique is described .    2.9643762961752245
perioperative morbidity does not increase .    2.866145155395144
systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection is the gold standard for evaluation of an exact pn stage .    2.64266771242661
therefore , it should be required that systematic mediastinal lymph node dissection be standard in the surgical treatment of bronchial carcinoma .    2.8058980942650478
in the diagnosis and treatment of acute scrotal pain and swelling it is important to differentiate between testicular torsion and UNK - orchitis .    3.195540439629105
a special case of a thirty - eight - year - old male UNK from UNK was presented in the urological service with acute scrotal pain .    2.635579650499403
to exclude testicular torsion , a diagnostic exploration of the UNK was done with the findings of an acute funiculitis with abscess formation .    2.9906102681636995
under surgical drainage of abscess together with medical treatment the acute inflammation disappeared .    2.2890860183726907
the diagnosis of UNK funiculitis was made after identifying the UNK in a blood vessel and in the peripheral blood UNK .    3.1611712447289704
a UNK medication with UNK UNK was administered with good symptomatic relief .    2.8445327019013433
we studied 10 patients with parkinson ' s disease and 12 patients with parkinson - plus - syndrome , trying to improve patients ' gait by application of various external rhythmic stimuli , including metronome stimulation ( 96 beats per minute = middle UNK ) .    2.1539527007120394
the test course of the patients was UNK meters and 3 u - turns .    3.1032874808300184
the patients ' gait quality under stimulation was compared with their free walk ( velocity , number of steps , number of freezing episodes ) .    2.212883063941543
march music stimulation was less effective and UNK stimulation ( UNK UNK on the patient ' s shoulder ) even produced negative results .    2.752484592775234
the positive effect of metronome stimulation was also found , when the tests were not performed inside the hospital building , but outside in the hospital UNK .    2.2287336210053206
metronome stimulation was comparably effective in both patient sub - groups examined in this study ( m . parkinson , parkinson - plus - syndrome ) and seems to be an important additional help in the treatment of these patients .    2.680787592174333
UNK UNK are not expensive , easy in handling , and portable .    2.463733977480466
a theoretical explanation of metronome stimulation effectivity in patients with parkinson ' s disease still needs to be elucidated .    2.8116384019672327
the occurrence of perineural epithelial complexes within the pancreas cannot always be regarded as evidence of malignancy .    2.324963080538879
chronic pancreatitis can induce alterations in the anatomy of the organ with a histological picture comparable to that of neural invasion .    2.5186527728618153
the important criteria for differential diagnosis are neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells or their UNK morphology without UNK .    2.5108231300096375
objectives repair of acute rupture of the achilles tendon through a percutaneous technique under general , regional , or local anesthesia .    2.2985992790236236
deciduosis of the appendix is a rare cause of acute appendicitis in pregnancy .    2.945146218670327
ectopic decidual cells localized in the submesothelial stroma may represent a physiologic reaction of the pluripotent stromal cells to UNK hormonal stimulation .    2.1434943223426193
less frequently , deciduosis is based on a preexisting extragenital UNK , visible in a localization other than strictly submesothelial , in residuals of cyclic proliferation and bleeding , and in endometrial glandular formations embedded in the decidual cells .    2.0965197396099
in 14 patients with acute lbp the effect of manual therapy was examined .    3.017873946307293
the examination was conducted with the triflexometer , which is an electromechanical measuring instrument for examination of the posture and function of the spine .    2.794574993308315
in our study we measured the spine from c7 to UNK in the sagittal and frontal planes .    2.629800027288721
improvement in movement was detected in all patients following manual therapy , as well as in UNK - , retro - and lateral flexion on both sides , and local functional disturbances also disappeared partially or totally .    2.642177966559615
our study shows that the triflexometer makes it possible to record the effect of manual therapy in acute lbp .    2.64691475821582
the proof of the local functional disturbances after manual therapy indicates that these patients have a higher risk of new episodes of acute lbp or perhaps of chronic lbp , and because of that there it is necessary to use other treatment forms .    2.310990336364844
diagnostic imaging after renal transplantation is of high importance in the differential diagnosis of peri - and postoperative complications .    2.7456865318360846
sonography with color duplex imaging is the method of choice in the diagnosis of acute transplant rejection .    2.8402654368627624
mri is an additional method in the diagnosis of transplant dysfunction especially in diagnosis of UNK fluid UNK .    3.228383807081443
angiography , complemented by carbon dioxide angiography , still is the gold standard in the diagnosis of transplant artery stenosis .    2.682900471107317
nutrients and trophic factors independent of nutritional substrates influence the proliferation and the differentiation of the cells that make up the intestinal wall .    2.2162656375272998
the resorptive mucosa must be differentiated from immunologically active cells of the " gut - associated lymphatic tissue " ( UNK ) .    2.4247781845204406
UNK is the main oxidative substrate of UNK and an important nitrogen donor ; its importance becomes apparent in very sick patients .    2.450763987984885
the amino acids arginine and ornithine are mainly important for immunological gut cells as precursors of no and UNK synthesis .    1.9101421494777024
complex UNK are fermented in the lower gut UNK to short - chain fatty acids , mainly acetic , UNK and UNK acid .    2.5882470321762083
the trophic effect of these acids is also mediated via an improvement of blood flow .    2.563903906186578
among the trophic substances independent of nutrients are the hormones UNK and UNK and various growth factors , contributing to the maintenance of a UNK gut mucosa .    2.9212049979090016
we investigated 88 patients with a total of 102 angiographically diagnosed intracranial aneurysms by means of transcranial colour coded duplex sonography ( tccd ) during a time period of 15 months .    2.5269944948765435
both the size and teh localization of teh UNK were determined .    2.3190599686019295
seventy aneurysms ( 77 % ) with a diameter of 16 + / - 8 mm ( 6 - UNK ) were detectable , with excellent visualization in 36 ( 42 % ) , moderate visualization in 34 ( 40 % ) , and no sufficient visualization in 16 ( 16 % ) aneurysms , respectively .    3.068449495029279
in another 16 cases ( 16 % ) there was no sufficient UNK window .    2.7231174780066842
thrombotic material inside the aneurysm was detectable in 16 / 20 cases ( 75 % ) , visualization of coil embolized aneurysms in 12 / 25 patients ( 48 % ) .    2.3816853761803123
tccd allows the follow up of cerebral aneurysms , with the detection of thrombosis and treatment effects after embolization .    2.987651486642631
the method is not valid for the detection of intracranial aneurysms    3.120990771171751
the authors report the case of a young patient suffering from plasmacellular osteomyelitis of the thoracic spine , a unusual localisation of this type of chronic osteomyelitis .    2.6321429721639884
they discuss the role of imaging diagnostic modalities in this disease , focussing on mri .    2.7663468005573733
the heidelberg retina tomograph ( hrt ) is a new instrument to analyze the three - dimensional structure of the retina .    3.073416128168218
it is based on confocal laser scanning technology .    2.8876301610334116
as parameters such as cup depth and cup volume can be UNK with a high degree of accuracy , this new instrument may prove to be an excellent tool to follow up swelling of the optic disk .    2.55547054645364
evaluation of three patients , aged between three months and five years because of failure to thrive and persistent diarrhea revealed the diagnosis of small bowel bacterial overgrowth .    2.5173417687484583
a combination of a typical history , endoscopy , laboratory , radiological and histological methods as well as the breath hydrogen test were used .    2.7166548374557506
all patients had preexisting intestinal disease : two ( former premature infants ) had been operated several times because of necrotizing UNK including resection of larger parts of small bowel .    2.060317502838369
the third patient was suffering from UNK UNK ' s disease .    3.1380763150647306
all patients gained weight and reported less complaints after antibiotic treatment with metronidazole .    2.1344635187556014
discussion : small bowel bacterial overgrowth has to be considered in the differential diagnosis of failure to thrive , especially in cases with preexisting intestinal disease .    2.925030781508222
the diagnosis may be substantiated by a combination of indirect methods .    2.7734220541794032
direct UNK analysis is difficult .    2.7673991874783064
usually , antibiotic treatment leads to a good weight gain after a short period of time .    2.580743334161714
in contrast to carotid endarterectomy , the indication for vertebral surgery is not standardized .    2.5636287221587737
in a prospective study including 44 patients , it was investigated whether extended diagnostics help in making the decision as to whether operative treatment should be given .    2.4851838598115292
the diagnostic procedures included dsa , cct , mri , 24 h ecg , otoneurological , and neurological examination , and ultrasonic flow measurement .    2.065382917008949
we compared the diagnostic results before and after surgery with the subjective symptoms of the patients .    2.849730310692125
two different surgical procedures were used : transposition of the vertebral artery to the cca or graft implantation between cca and atlas loop .    2.2328762825734225
in the follow up period ( 6 - 9 months ) , 72 % of the patients had improved or were without complaints .    2.9039489293237217
the validity of the applied diagnostic parameters relating to a successful operation were disappointing especially the ultrasonic flow measurement .    2.127624176832585
in our opinion , exact anamnesis and sufficient angiography are decisive for the indication of vertebral surgery .    2.1644945750302758
it has long been a goal to develop a means to measure UNK angles in three dimensions simultaneously .    2.2661131307472466
a three - dimensional binocular method is naturally needed especially with surgical procedures that affect three dimensions of ocular motility .    2.1817124528718326
in situations of depressed myocardial function , the role of immunological mechanisms has been studied recently .    2.6026119213969414
in different pathophysiological situations , such as chronic heart failure , open heart surgery with extracorporal circulation , cardiac transplantation , myocardial infarction and angina pectoris , patterns have been described with elevation of proinflammatory cytokines , such as tumor necrosis factor - , interleukin - 1 , interleukin - 6 , and reversible myocardial dysfunction , which may represent a final common pathway .    2.6930813650818277
the available data suggest a modulation of important determinants of pump function , i . e . , contractility , preload , afterload , and heart rate , by cytokines .    2.2211972139186873
potential mechanisms include the - adrenoceptor - and nitric oxide pathway , as well as a direct impact on intracellular calcium homeostasis .    2.435387984950827
interventional strategies based on this understanding are beginning to emerge .    2.507013764291062
a total of 121 patients undergoing open hernia repair was divided into two groups .    2.1824283817429
the first group was permitted to UNK postoperatively , allowing the wound to come into direct contact with the water , the second group was UNK to keep the incision dry .    2.079574841278402
water contact , wound healing and patient satisfaction were assessed .    2.5596025842423566
there was no difference in wound healing between the two groups and no manifest infection .    2.5588423823194666
in children and adolescents motor / vocal tics and obsessive - compulsive behavior are known to be closely related .    2.3283385082667323
thereby , a continuum of symptoms ranging from single tics to a mixed picture of tics / UNK / obsessive - compulsive traits to clinically relevant UNK and UNK could be described .    2.263275456902204
as neurobiological substrates dysfunctions in corresponding UNK - UNK - thalamo - cortical circuits ( sensorimotor circuit in UNK symptomatology , orbitofrontal circuit in obsessive - compulsive behavior ) were postulated .    2.046124179934831
for both disturbances behavioral therapy can be used to improve control mechanisms to UNK tics and obsessive - compulsive behavior , respectively , and psychopharmacological agents can be UNK to compensate UNK in neurotransmitter systems .    2.446662732190471
in case of a mixed UNK picture it is necessary to include interventions for both UNK of the symptom - continuum in the therapeutic programme to achieve extensive improvement as a basis for a further positive development of the patient .    2.7590477390511476
as laparoscopic cholecystectomy becomes more established , interest in legal aspects increases .    2.1708993027083547
the legal cases dealt with in germany since the introduction of this laparoscopic method in 1989 were studied to determine the legal consequences of complications .    2.3872586537655796
of 40 cases , 16 were judged to be cases of malpractice , whereas 24 were not .    2.1607098354691927
the most common cause was injury of the common bile duct ( 26 cases ) .    2.6068199270415637
seven of these 26 cases were judged to be cases of malpractice , 2 of these as grave errors .    2.1921588537812653
the main reasons for the acceptance of a case as malpractice were delay in changing to conventional cholecystectomy , delayed revision , laparoscopic revisions and not UNK to conventional cholecystectomy in unclear situations .    2.183191387575284
purpose of this review is , to highlight key issues in transplantation medicine today and to summarise basic information on current state of perfused organ transplantation .    2.1980907248192345
there is special emphasis on ethical and legal considerations with regard to living donor transplantation , brain death concept , donor consent and organ allocation .    2.263606056778511
transplantation frequencies and the impact of whole organ transplantation on the treatment concept for patients with end stage organ disease is heavily dependent on donor and organ availability .    2.473048274291477
organ donor rate of 25 to 30 donors per million inhabitants per year seems to yield sufficient organ supply for patients on renal replacement therapy .    1.9511398817168402
15 to 20 liver transplantations per million inhabitants per year , my be sufficient , to cover the need of organs for non malignant end stage liver diseases .    2.22763243784979
this frequency my be achieved by increasing donor rates and employing " split techniques " , where one liver is used for two recipients .    2.160006825101413
one year graft survival in kidney transplantation can be expected to be between 85 and 90 % , one year patient survival in heart and liver transplantation can be expected to be beyond 80 % .    2.2228299414696404
patient - and / or graft loss after the first year is in the order of 1 to 5 % .    3.1124864629551143
whole organ transplantation for kidneys , hearts and UNK are considered routine procedures , lung transplantation is reaching standard phase , pancreas and combined pancreas kidney transplantation is well established technically , but its indication is still controversial .    2.0697268238114552
laser - induced interstitial thermotherapy ( litt ) is a promising method of treating different types of tumors .    2.593652900989068
to increase the effectiveness of litt , a new thermo - controlled application system for minimal invasive intervention was designed .    2.661552576598124
this laser system consists of a laser applicator 3 mm in diameter , insertion equipment and an UNK : yag laser source .    2.582800436674514
the power of the laser source is controlled dynamically by UNK in a water - cooling system of the laser applicator .    2.703092168943918
in in vivo experiments in five pigs , within 10 min we found homogeneous coagulation regions in the liver that were of 3 cm and 5 cm in diameter .    2.1775877978579476
via ultrasound we observed in real time the increasing coagulation zone that appeared as a UNK halo .    2.4188250644605116
however , due to perifocal edema , the real coagulation area was smaller than detected by ultrasound .    2.184281880014814
the reparative reaction after irradiation was early fibrosis .    2.276715601421661
in the course of 4 weeks , the surrounding scar capsule , containing fibrocytes , biliary UNK and collagen fibers enlarged .    2.231674295517138
as a result , the coagulation necrosis became more and more fragmented between collagen fibers and was largely resorbed .    2.123420621642663
the absence of complications in our animal experiments suggest that the technique of thermo - controlled laser light application is safe and useful in therapy for metastases that are not resectable .    2.518690252845067
attachment theory , originally developed by john UNK , becomes increasingly relevant in the field of psychotherapy ( research ) .    2.252559693436114
this review starts with a definition of central concepts and hypotheses of this theory and summarizes results regarding the development as well as correlates of attachment , mainly from research in developmental UNK .    2.092695588220986
related to adults , attachment theory has to be UNK which is done in another part of this paper .    2.9078505505945613
inflammation - mediated osteopenia is an animal model for bone mass reduction following chronic inflammation .    2.3127652270216026
we found a reduction of calcitriol serum concentrations during the inflammatory process , in addition cytokines are increased .    2.631666142286174
treatment of the animals with calcitriol is able to prevent bone mass reduction and to preserve bone formation .    2.449456818604946
the beneficial effects of UNK , however , appear to be difficult to prove .    4.383628093339618
in this study a comparison was made of heart rate ( hr ) , blood pressure ( bp ) , and norepinephrine , epinephrine , and cortisol levels .    2.551507271535519
in group i 19 children recieved only psychological treatment , while in group ii 21 children received 0 . 2 mg / kg midazolam orally .    2.5069711164548467
measuring points were directly before medication , 30 min UNK , and at induction of anaesthesia .    2.830329844097118
during the observation period the patients ( 5 - 10 years old ) remained UNK .    3.3721586078748005
at the beginning of the study the parameters of all patients were within a normal range ; 30 min after premedication the hr and bp were significantly higher in group i than in group ii .    3.0106711820899053
in contrast to group i , epinephrine levels in group ii were lower at the beginning of anaesthesia than before premedication .    2.620423980313421
in both groups , norepinephrine levels were the same at induction of anaesthesia as before premedication .    2.3378584598506613
cortisol decreased only in patients who received midazolam .    3.2863415051679996
hr , bp , as well as humoral stress parameters indicate that midazolam in a dose of 0 . 2 mg / kg orally is sufficient to reduce preoperative stress in children .    2.571851943913655
a case of isolated right ventricular myocardial tuberculoma with pericardial effusions is presented .    2.3358247088347945
the diagnosis of myocardial tuberculoma was initially suggested by echocardiography and later by magnetic resonance imaging .    2.427099886231168
the diagnosis of cardiac tuberculosis was confirmed by demonstration of UNK UNK in the pericardial fluid .    3.242572923403808
this is a very rare condition which is usually diagnosed only by necropsy .    2.5176801720546433
myocardial tuberculoma should figure on the list of UNK masses visualized at echocardiography .    2.2196526856986907
the incidence of hepatitis a infections has decreased due to improved UNK conditions in germany .    2.457545259660346
however , hepatitis a is one of the most important diseases UNK to the country .    2.9643876323050486
currently , more than the half of all registered hepatitis a infections are acquired in foreign countries .    2.3618714561521106
according to the decreased morbidity over the past few decades most younger people ( age below 50 years ) are not UNK and , subsequently , this age group is at higher risk during exposure in foreign countries .    2.273417511792862
therefore , a hepatitis a vaccination is recommended before travelling in countries with a higher incidence of hepatitis a ( southern europe , africa , south america , and asia ) .    2.0022597358112617
lactic acid bacteria ( lab ) are a group of gram - positive organism , which have in common a UNK metabolism with lactic acid as the major end - product .    2.208722666175942
except for bifidobacteria , the lab are UNK closely related .    2.2768855089851696
they directly contribute to human well - being as they are the most important germs in the production process of fermented UNK which constitute one fourth of our diet .    2.443285410715844
they are , furthermore , an essential component of the mucosal flora and especially of the intestinal flora .    2.8576613914521034
the genus streptococcus contains highly pathogenic species which can be clearly differentiated from the useful germs .    2.400361942640871
the intestinal flora contains such species of the genus UNK that are also important in food UNK and species which are strongly adapted to the intestines and therefore , can be found exclusively in this ecological niche .    2.2909483325177558
a special status UNK bifidobacteria and enterococci .    2.490664475911126
enterococci are rather ubiquitous , participate in UNK food fermentations , are found in the mucosal flora and are UNK as opportunistic pathogens .    2.19634315085493
to influence the intestinal flora and to achieve health promoting effects lab are isolated from the intestinal flora , grown and employed either as pharmaceutical preparations or UNK to food ( usually fermented milk ) .    1.9591749795333355
these bacteria are termed " probiotics " .    2.390768671773907
the exposition of consumers to high numbers of germs belonging to one or a few species needs an evaluation of their safety for human health .    2.086803773283896
in this process the traditional experience with the safe nature of the species can serve as an important criterion .    2.492104663229254
in front of this background , lab in probiotics can be considered to be especially safe , nevertheless some restrictions have to be made .    2.5646634473773893
in addition they should not produce UNK UNK ( e . g .    2.45495036186886
histamine , tyrosine or UNK ) and should not UNK UNK .    3.2419323514419367
the assessment may also include the following : absence of a potential for UNK of bile salts , induction of platelet aggregation and binding to fibrinogen and UNK .    2.2828601855323067
these examinations may be required as certain lab have been identified in clinical isolates .    2.430272194598804
the isolates were , however , obtained in the most majority of cases from debilitated patients .    2.9429816915438662
the germs were components of the body flora as well as of the environment , organisms deliberately employed in food fermentations or probiotics have never been isolated .    2.456806383614215
dural sinus thrombosis is not uncommon .    2.7873078859213463
due to the nonspecific symptomatology , as well as the UNK etiology , clinical diagnosis may be difficult .    2.9036685467319603
in these cases imaging procedures are frequently crucial in deciding how to proceed and how to treat .    2.1428209182685376
the aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic utility of helical ct in the detection of dural sinus thrombosis .    2.4933774412075405
in 20 patients with clinically suspected thrombosis ct angiography was performed .    2.8326014923802196
in 6 patients dural sinus thrombosis was diagnosed .    2.6312538591693224
in order to acquire also arterial vessels , a short delay of about 22 s after the onset of the application of contrast medium was selected .    2.620875456600476
by this method we found an occlusion of the mca in two patients with clinically suspected sinus thrombosis .    2.9893000476262417
in all patients the transverse slices and the multiplanar reconstructions showed filling defects or an " empty delta " sign .    1.9641082273882324
with irregular outlines the thrombus could be depicted over the complete course of the sinus .    2.583807902343478
the mip reconstructions were particularly helpful in the evaluation of the vessel anatomy and the pathological collateral venous drainage .    2.709152877643384
in three patients mr angiograms were available for comparison .    2.619598912681413
the smaller veins , such as the v . UNK inferior , were less clearly depicted than in ct angiography .    2.3800247291336465
ct angiography is a fast and reliable method to exclude or verify a sinus thrombosis .    2.2868478594629282
it can be performed immediately after non - enhanced ct .    2.945086084792919
according to our present experience ct angiography is sufficient for the diagnosis of a sinus thrombosis .    2.780788676503262
coronary angiography ist considered to be the most important component in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease .    3.505339560337847
only the lumen may be visualized using contrast radiography of the coronary arteries , however .    2.3973221991474696
despite typical symptoms , an UNK image of the coronary arteries is sometimes unable to show unambiguous stenotic lesions of the coronary arteries .    2.6589360478792137
in such cases , intravascular ultrasound provides a new complementary diagnostic tool for detecting even early forms of arteriosclerosis or angiographically underestimated coronary findings .    2.002602485835472
two cases are used to illustrate this .    2.937378863116998
in those , angiographic visualization of the coronary arteries was unable to produce an unambiguous finding despite typical clinical symptoms , yet intravascular ultrasound could detect considerable arteriosclerotic wall changes .    2.1347186477071878
purpose : the pontine micturition center plays a central role in regulating the micturition reflex , but the precise neural mechanisms are unclear .    2.132267812317294
the cerebral cortex is involved in UNK micturition but there is little knowledge on specific evolutionary higher brain regions .    2.296591374296016
the present study aimed to investigate whether cortical activation during micturition can be demonstrated by eeg power spectra patterns and to explore whether specific cortical regions involved in the interaction of inhibition and release during the micturition reflex can be discerned .    2.0638228980614883
we also aimed to test whether intravesical electrostimulation ( UNK ) therapy in patients with micturition disorders has an effect on patterns of cortical activity .    2.7434452589816436
background : indirect traumatic optic neuropathy represents a severe , potential vision - threatening disease process that requires close interdisciplinary cooperation for treatment .    1.9730865696155009
in general , any therapy has been dis - UNK controversially in the literature .    2.2634232077307748
based upon experiences with spinal cord trauma , high - dose steroid therapy is recommended initially to minimize secondary consequences following orbital trauma .    2.221909071454871
the usefulness of surgical decompression of the optic nerve has been confirmed in several studies but is still not recommended in principle .    2.680135591229849
in recent years there has been an increasing incidence of streptococcal toxic shock - like syndrome ( tsls ) in otherwise healthy adults .    2.1511956719495013
it is characterized by fever , rash , hypotension and early shock with consecutive organ failure and a mortality rate of about 30 % .    2.170113598832043
various aspects of the pathophysiology , diagnosis and therapy are discussed .    3.5424071150152985
only early , aggressive and repeated surgical debridement can reduce the bacterial load and decrease circulating UNK and thereby , in combination with antibiotic therapy , decrease the high mortality of this entity .    2.3346836913033298
purpose : to test , whether axial , coronal and sagittal mip and UNK reconstructions of diagnostic quality can be obtained from 1 - mm collimation msct data of the chest for the evaluation of thoracic anatomy and pathology .    2.336667738884455
the risk to health UNK by a UNK lifestyle is a problem of our times .    2.771345198934084
in contrast to the previous assumption that only fairly high - intensity sporting exercise undertaken over a minimum period of 20 min produces health - related benefits , recent studies have shown that even everyday UNK ( UNK UNK , UNK walking and cycling ) can have a UNK effects on health , particularly in those who take little exercise .    2.334261436340922
so now the recommendation is : exercise of moderate intensity lasting 30 min at least 5 times a week , corresponding to an energy consumption of about 150 UNK / day or 1000 UNK / week .    1.8853074882820096
the results of experimental studies on sport and arthritis and sport and osteoporosis point to the UNK of taking up or maintaining an active sporting lifestyle .    2.3315842659496187
for one thing , it can be assumed that a moderate amount of movement does not increase the risk of developing arthritis : for another , sporting activity during early and late childhood produces a high maximum bone mass , UNK delaying the development of osteoporosis in later life .    2.279472929822309
the new guidelines on the extent and intensity of health - giving exercise make it easier to advocate exercise and sport for disease prevention and health promotion because they appear to implement .    2.0217493857055646
more difficult , however , is deciding on a suitable method for motivating inactive individuals to increase their level of physical UNK .    2.285601414582279
a model that has proved effective in smoking cessation programmes , and one that can also be applied to exercise counselling ( UNK model ) , can help in the selection of an appropriate counselling strategy .    2.361261558396193
depending on whether an individual is inactive , or sporadically or regularly active , each one UNK his or her own strategies primarily to maintain this lifestyle .    1.932967767284698
assuming that the counselling is adapted to the level of activity , the patient ' s attitude and behaviour can be influenced both more effectively and more economically .    2.648275940155317
background : UNK keratectomy ( prk ) is the most frequent refractive surgical procedure worldwide .    2.7291784052375347
this procedure results in considerable alterations of the corneal structure .    2.514351020432624
what does this mean for the mechanical properties of the cornea ?    2.7951831770519306
beginning in the UNK UNK reich developed the fundamental concepts of a body - oriented psychotherapy out of psychoanalysis .    2.622230473478934
he started from considerations of UNK , sexuality and the analysis of resistance and character patterns .    2.7852288045829905
thus he began to UNK repressed affects through working on muscular tensions and bodily expressions .    1.9512669677892007
that way their meaning in the person ' s history could be understood and a self - healing process UNK .    2.4176813108384323
this approach to release constrained energy is still valid for UNK schools such as bioenergetics , UNK , UNK and others whose understanding of human nature and of healing processes is similar to those of other schools of humanistic psychotherapy .    2.246418492055022
bodily processes are used as indicators for the processes and UNK of therapies .    3.001570802896918
besides there are impulses in modern body UNK to work with the body in the relationship and transference process and attempts to reintegrate psychoanalytical concepts .    2.1493471987894788
recurrent UNK in young patients with subsequent severe postthrombotic syndrome and chronic venous leg ulcers may be caused by underlying hereditary disorders of hemostasis or may occur as part of other congenital syndromes .    2.1764388606272087
the most common hereditary disorders of hemostasis in this respect appear to be deficiencies of antithrombin iii , protein c , and protein s , and activated protein c resistance ( mutations of factor v ) .    2.045644984975233
less frequently , UNK , increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels , or deficiencies of tissue plasminogen activator or heparin cofactor ii may be found .    2.3273534811348666
klinefelter ' s syndrome and UNK are prime examples of those rare congenital disorders indirectly associated with an elevated risk of thrombosis in young individuals .    2.5118262176431467
early diagnosis of these disorders will allow timely treatment , preventive care and counselling of patients as well as family members .    2.5597761888819996
epidurography with contrast medium is used to verify the correct UNK of an epidural catheter and to detect malpositioning .    2.4852018526170565
there is great variability in the distribution of contrast medium according to the individual morphology of the epidural space and the way it is injected .    2.859003557777763
results of investigations of the anatomy of the spinal canal and epidural space performed with anatomic specimens , epiduroscopy , and conventional and computed tomographic ( ct ) epidurography are sometimes contradictory .    2.279674546778976
we have performed ct epidurography in approximately 30 patients to date .    2.39416417464208
insights regarding the distribution of contrast medium in the epidural space can help to interpret conventional epidurographies and to explain special features , such as the " UNK - road - track phenomenon " or the plica mediana dorsalis .    2.45949173732795
patients scheduled for major abdominal operations were studied .    2.400740408532654
catheters were introduced into the thoracic epidural space on the day before the operation .    2.576442832047427
conventional epidurographies were performed routinely after insertion of the catheters with a mobile x - ray apparatus , usually in the recovery room , using 5 ml iopamidol ( UNK 250 m ) .    2.1842035622540017
selected patients ( good mental state and stable psychic condition ) , after written consent and with approval of the local ethical committee , were investigated with ct epidurography using the same contrast medium ( partly UNK ) .    2.095337091639263
when small volumes ( 5 ml ) of iopamidol were injected slowly , we regularly observed a railroad - track phenomenon in the ap images of conventional epidurographies .    1.9605832310078453
after rapid injection of larger volumes ( 10 - 15 ml ) , the spread was more homogeneous and sometimes outline a UNK zone of contrast distribution in the midline .    2.47308558184843
ct epidurography in these cases ( 5 out of 30 patients ) revealed a plica mediana dorsalis .    2.597534390471722
in the majority of the ct scans of the thoracic epidural space its anterior ( ventral ) compartment was UNK by contrast medium .    2.434446767444852
according to the findings of several investigators , dura mater and ligamentum longitudinale posterius have grown together , so that an epidural space does not exist in ventral thoracic segments of the spinal canal .    2.2063758951345362
in lower thoracic and lumbar segments both structures are separate , and a wide anterior epidural space was present and filled with contrast medium .    2.3069734303154794
in other cases the dorsal and dorsolateral epidural space was completely filled , but the contrast medium stopped behind the spinal nerves and surrounding dural sheaths , as if these structures , together with the connective tissue strands between them , formed a membrane that spread in a frontal plane .    2.026806417311255
a railroad - track phenomenon is interpreted in the literature as the x - ray correlate of contrast medium spread in the subdural space , indicating an incorrect catheter position .    2.29497249522058
according to conventional epidurographies and confirmed by ct scans , this feature is also seen regulary in cases with correct catheter position .    2.327370020412852
small volumes of iopamidol spread preferentially into the wider parts of the epidural space between the gaps of the vertebral UNK , whereas the dura mater and periosteal layers touch at the inner side of the UNK and UNK , allowing the existence of only a potential epidural space .    2.7345170911913415
ct epidurography is a valuable tool to provide better insight into the morphology of the epidural space when filled with fluid ( contrast medium , local anaesthetics ) , UNK findings using epiduroscopy and anatomic specimens .    2.2847452726199595
a 71 - year - old woman suffered from pronounced erosion of her nose after soft x - ray therapy ( total dose 28 gy , half dose depth 10 . 5 - 11 . 5 mm ) .    2.5530976367168208
5 weeks after the end of the irradiation no healing tendency was observed .    2.7475695117793726
this unusual clinical course was caused by a simultaneously existing pemphigus vulgaris that worsened after radiotherapy , presumably as a consequence of the release of epidermal antigens .    2.3828677904229343
in this case it is UNK that the pemphigus was induced by the radiotherapy , as has been reported on several occasions in the literature .    2.3937556495801076
however , this possibility cannot be entirely excluded .    2.293648651068729
a vascular etiology of parkinson ' s disease ( pd ) has been long debated .    2.5817616965300405
in order to search for an ischemic basis of pd we assessed the clinical symptomatology of a consecutive group of 60 pd patients and UNK their frequency of cerebrovascular risk factors , carotid atherosclerosis and ischemic brain lesions with age - matched groups of stroke patients and normals .    2.1623026809428194
there were 16 ( 27 % ) subjects with pd who also had symptoms of cerebrovascular disease .    2.195497950601617
the frequencies of carotid stenoses , ischemic brain lesions and most of cerebrovascular risk factors seen in the latter group was comparable with those of stroke patients and significantly higher than in the investigational subsets of patients with " pure " pd and normals .    2.4714788147335165
only one ( 1 . 6 % ) individual with pd presented signs suggestive of an ischemic etiology of parkinsonism .    2.5580184847647565
these findings suggest that cerebrovascular disease occurs in approximately one fourth of patients with pd , but seldomly is causally related .    2.6357098423503365
neurological involvement is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with sarcoidosis .    3.3121899132932837
the aim of this study was to evaluate the role of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in the diagnosis of patients with neurosarcoidosis .    3.115040537327384
the mri brain scans of 22 patients with sarcoidosis were retrospectively reviewed , along with the clinical information provided in the request form .    2.292473418751414
all patients had signs and symptoms UNK to the head and were examined with gadolinium enhancement .    2.942976677151905
cranial ( facial ) nerve paralysis was the most common clinical manifestation identified in 10 patients .    2.741173111045232
a wide spectrum of mr findings was noted : UNK and white matter lesions on t2 w spin echo images , mimicking multiple sclerosis ( 46 % ) ; multiple supratentorial and UNK brain lesions , mimicking metastases ( 36 % ) ; solitary intraaxial mass , mimicking high - grade astrocytoma ( 9 % ) ; solitary UNK mass , mimicking UNK ( 5 % ) ; leptomeningeal enhancement ( 36 % ) .    2.307162084246346
the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is often difficult , particularly so in patients who lack either pulmonary or systemic manifestations of sarcoidosis .    2.2824590148254975
mri shows a wide spectrum of brain abnormalities associated with neurosarcoidosis .    2.3904014154459263
these findings , however , are not specific for sarcoidosis and one must consider appropriate clinical circumstances in arriving at the correct diagnosis .    2.4430363342518597
in selected cases with isolated brain involvement , meningeal or cerebral biopsy may be required .    2.3244988290369553
in 1990 , we first described the papular - purpuric " gloves and socks " syndrome ( ppgss ) .    1.8715313360640378
it is characterized by an itching erythema and edema of the hands and feet together with oral mucosal lesions and fever .    2.2884768499337804
the skin lesions subsequently become purpuric and resolve spontaneously after a few days .    2.288533163017407
in a few cases of ppgss , other viral infections have been found , for example hepatitis b and measles .    2.638283851177055
we report on a patient with ppgss and review the literature .    2.4064433623440546
fungus - UNK in the renal pelvis are an unusual manifestation of severe candida albicans infection .    2.6676943344119532
a newborn infant with UNK - association suffered from fungus balls in the renal pelvis after candida albicans sepsis , and developed a hydronephrosis with beginning postrenal failure .    2.08550221144077
following systemic antimycotic therapy with amphotericin b and flucytosin as well as local irrigation with amphotericin b via percutaneous nephrostomy renal function normalised rapidly .    2.2136645058104145
discussion : since the incidence of systemic mycotic infection in neonates becomes more common the differential diagnosis of UNK should include fungus balls .    2.7520599719741465
interactional understanding in psychoanalysis , especially the concept of the ' third point ' , suggests that the development of insight , UNK and relationship are dimensions of one and the same UNK process peculiar to psychoanalytic understanding .    2.691368176047378
in this context the psychoanalytic method , here understood as working with resistance , transference and countertransference , does not only offer a route to UNK , but also to the formation of a conflict - solving , UNK , and supportive relationship peculiar to psychoanalysis .    2.337466880462295
this is exemplified by a case history .    2.7113462037492315
the UNK supreme court ruled that in exceptional instances , physician - assisted suicide might be justifiable for patients with unbearable mental suffering but no physical illness .    2.0249758272155973
a recent report shows that explicit requests for physician - assisted suicide are not uncommon in psychiatric practice in the netherlands .    2.151557371328409
some of those requests were granted and their medical background was described .    2.1350030017852295
psychiatric consultation for medical patients who request physician - assisted suicide is relatively rare .    2.221981738077875
pemphigus is a rare UNK autoimmune bullous disease .    3.129374414766854
two major variants , pemphigus vulgaris ( pv ) and pemphigus UNK ( pf ) , are distinguished .    2.200608622661805
the aim of this study was to document the clinical and UNK findings in all pemphigus patients who were diagnosed in the department of dermatology at the university of würzburg over the past 10 years .    2.6929223089194916
post - dural puncture headache ( pdph ) is a significant complication of spinal anaesthesia .    2.7017232450876554
diameter and tip of the needle as well as the patient ' s age have been proven to be important determinants .    3.3293484818801438
the question of whether post - operative recumbency can reduce the risk of pdph has not been answered uniformly .    2.844799040777884
and besides , some studies referring to this subject reveal methodical failures , for example , as to clear definition and exact documentation of post - operative immobilization .    2.292217419118335
furthermore , fine - gauge needles ( UNK or more ) have not been investigated yet .    2.3514801319736622
the first aim of our study was therefore to examine the role of recumbency in the prevention of pdph under controlled conditions using thin needles .    2.52411376160175
secondly , we wanted to confirm the reported prophylactic effect of needles with a modified , atraumatic tip ( UNK and UNK ) by comparing them to quincke needles of identical diameter .    2.2422727013706223
most of the former investigators compared quincke with atraumatic needles of different size regardless of the known influence of the diameter on pdph .    2.434635159078375
three characteristic developments in modern western societies usually are considered to be independent variables in the ethical discussion : .    2.2560949897048186
background : neuropathic pain syndromes may be treated by intervention at the sympathetic nervous system .    2.503838213740088
the pain in these syndromes is therefore called sympathetically maintained pain ( smp ) .    2.181150511452875
typical disorders with a smp component are complex regional pain syndromes ( reflex sympathetic dystrophy and UNK ) , traumatic UNK and herpes zoster .    2.327474240984427
the tendency towards sphincter - preserving resection for distal rectal cancers has led to a UNK of the technique of coloanal anastomosis ( caa ) in recent years .    2.860741929249982
in order to improve functional results , creation of a colonic j - pouch in conjunction with a coloanal anastomosis ( cpa ) was proposed .    2.2969360182624383
two different operation techniques exist : i ) double - stapling with the anastomosis close to the dentate line and ii ) intersphincteric resection with the anastomosis located immediately at the dentate line .    2.0518595238685213
a long rectal remnant after double - stapling leads to UNK in 15 % of the patients due to stool retention in the UNK remnant .    2.884265624615116
no UNK motility patterns were recorded from the pouch which is UNK UNK by upper colonic UNK .    2.204647665157108
under these conditions the average stool frequency is reduced from 2 - 6 / d after caa to 1 - 3 / d after cpa .    2.406956561371731
this effect is maximal during the first postoperative months , but is still significant after 3 years .    2.6079674297181925
colonic pouch construction also leads , due to better blood supply and prevention of pelvic hematomas , to a significant decrease of the anastomotic insufficiency rate from 10 , 0 % after caa to 5 , 4 % after cpa .    2.484932505146993
therefore creation of a colonic j - pouch should be combined with coloanal reconstruction if the oncologic situation allows a sphincter - preserving procedure .    1.9790199041981638
background : workers in the construction industry carry an increased risk for head and neck cancer due to the high consumption of alcohol and tobacco plus exposure to occupational carcinogenic or co - carcinogenic agents .    2.2838411676055097
these latter substances include asbestos , tar products , metal dust , wood dust , cement dust and UNK .    1.8488057264491617
presently , there are no well - defined standards for documentation of echocardiographic studies .    2.6993822039903863
nevertheless , standards are essential to provide comparability of data and to realize electronic communication , both essential for quality management in echocardiography .    2.252456647881041
embolia cutis medicamentosa ( UNK syndrom ) is a very rare complication of intramuscular injections which presents with extensive necrosis of the injected skin area .    2.477650475347284
intra - arterial and / or para - arterial injections after prior perforation of certain vessels are discussed as possible pathogenetic mechanisms .    2.534569204359646
we describe the occurrence of embolia cutis medicamentosa after intra - articular injections into the knee .    2.464596188976913
in a 30 - beds - unit of the orthopedic university clinic in bochum for an example we studied the frequency of combined injection therapy with local anesthesia and chirotherapy in a one year period .    2.2711423004364613
there have been done 191 injections into UNK joints as well as 28 injections into facett joints of the cervical spine and additionally 315 into facett joints of the lumbar spine .    2.3479060923105175
on the other side there have been done 122 UNK maneuvers at cervical , thoracic or lumbar spine by senior doctors with education in manual medicine .    2.011065138844612
the injection therapy however was done in mean predilection sites of the patients suffering from cervical spine disorders or low back pain , the chirotherapy was done in other spine areas .    2.605593688043896
the growing number of doctors with an education in manual medicine seems to improve the chirotherapy of the mean pathology as well , but it is not able to reduce the number of local injection therapy .    2.832100268192869
in a retrospective case control study at the university of frankfurt , germany , 101 babies born to opiate - addicted mothers were identified from birth charts from 1988 to 1995 .    2.2021842849773057
after birth , they developed a withdrawal syndrome ( neonatal abstinence syndrome ) .    2.2438227366235357
fifty control infants and their mothers were selected from neonatal wards .    2.2548847850748373
the group of opiate - exposed babies was subdivided into a group born to mothers without methadone treatment ( n = 48 ) and a group born to mothers who were enrolled in a methadone program ( n = 51 ) .    2.5555540043951885
the methadone infants had a significantly higher mean birth weight ( UNK g ) than children in the group without methadone ( UNK g ) .    2.48539446053697
the abstinence syndrome was much more intense in the methadone group ( convulsions 47 . 1 % ) than in heroin - exposed babies without methadone treatment ( convulsions 27 . 1 % ) .    2.2526987803667473
women in methadone maintenance programs lived in more stable socioeconomic conditions than opiate - addicted women without methadone substitution .    1.9549720697780977
moreover , they cared significantly better for their babies : 81 . 3 % of the methadone mothers visited their children on a regular basis and 90 . 9 % cared adequately .    2.3340229248798425
the data emphasize the need in future research to look more closely at the role of methadone treatment programs in the development of opiate - exposed babies .    2.4982286454504847
neurofibromatosis type 1 ( nf1 ) is an autosomal dominant hereditary disease of high UNK and variable expression .    2.5171657531849077
epidemiologic data on craniofacial manifestations are still lacking .    2.32683366081484
up until now 74 patients with nf1 have been treated at the department of oral and maxillofacial surgery of the university of hamburg .    2.711984561550599
forty - two patients presented periorbital and orbital neurofibromas varying in extension and in the severity of findings of the affected site .    2.7942746451932874
surgical therapy is mainly based on tumour reduction , frequently combined with face - lifting .    2.145882454264698
in our experience neurofibromas of the neck tend to be pseudo - encapsulated , facilitating the preparation of the tumour .    2.480926049814497
on the other hand , identification and preparation of diffuse infiltrating neurofibromas in the trigeminal nerve region are difficult and local recurrence must be expected .    1.9533072058665968
objective : the revised UNK - UNK valve was introduced onto the market in june 1990 .    2.5127722737963443
the results of a prospective follow - up study after valve replacement with this prosthesis are presented .    2.702295815621085
a granular cell tumor is one of the rare tumors of the esophagus .    3.2700674145482975
we present the case of a 65 - year - old male patient , who was admitted to our hospital for an elective cholecystectomy .    2.610958034065702
in the routine diagnostic gastroscopy an intramural tumor in the distal esophagus was incidentally found .    2.5061105231855723
repeated endoscopic biopsies did not reveal the histologic diagnosis , although endoscopic ultrasound invasion to the tunica muscularis could not be excluded .    2.347218024214461
after indicating the operative therapy , the tumor was removed through a thoracoscopic approach .    2.568739128572067
the histologic specimen showed a granular cell tumor of the esophagus ( tumor of abrikossoff ) .    2.3601227122665627
since the tumor grade was unknown , our therapy seemed to be justified because of the low risk involved in minimally invasive operative procedures .    2.5230658186687203
there has been much discussion and controversy in the literature on this subject , including the potential for malignancy and the correct therapy regime , with a general shift to conservative or minimally invasive treatment .    2.5971506988719537
the case is discussed with a review of the literature .    2.6762067199218977
this review deals with the differential diagnosis and treatment of critically ill neuromuscular patients .    2.839237477571994
acute muscular weakness may be a sign of newly acquired neuromuscular disorders or of an exacerbation of a previously existing disease .    2.34157692266498
typical features of the more common neuromuscular conditions are presented and the problems of neurocritical care delineated .    2.983254666779358
the appropriate ancillary tests are presented .    2.455452142678851
psychiatric care for chronic schizophrenic patients has improved in recent years , but for severely ill patients , often with multiple comorbid psychiatric conditions and in great need of care , the situation remains unsatisfactory .    2.2984418896600376
community - based psychiatric care is limited and psychiatric hospitals are now cutting back on inpatient care .    2.2338128468837217
the quality of care that chronically mentally ill patients receive at independant psychiatric nursing homes removed from population centers is undetermined , and many patients end up in UNK or homeless UNK unable to provide for their psychiatric needs .    1.9975234872067598
neither a reliable way to assess the needs of these complicated patients nor a scientific basis for therapeutic intervention exists yet .    2.2763783399204898
a diagnostic scoring system , recently published by UNK et al .    2.308249938799125
in this journal , was validated by analyzing the clinicopathological data of a consecutive series of 2 , 359 patients , admitted for suspicion of acute appendicitis .    2.1073099634285146
the results of the scoring system were compared to the results of clinical evaluation by junior ( provisional ) and senior surgeons ( final clinical diagnosis ) .    2.487206162946663
to assess the diagnostic ability of the score , the accuracy and positive predictive value were defined as the major diagnostic performance parameters ; the rate of theoretical negative laparotomies and that of diagnostic errors served as the major procedural performance parameters .    2.6071943507638773
the overall sensitivity , specificity , positive predictive value , negative predictive value , and accuracy of the provisional clinical diagnosis were 0 . 50 , 0 . 94 , 0 . 77 , 0 . 83 , and 0 . 82 ; 0 . 93 , for the score 0 . 63 , 0 . 93 , 0 . 77 , 0 . 86 and 0 . 84 , and for the final clinical diagnosis 0 . 90 , 0 . 94 , 0 . 85 , 0 . 96 , and 0 . 93 , respectively .    2.6676976604657643
of the main diagnostic performance parameter , the accuracy of the score was UNK better than that of provisional clinical diagnosis ( p < 0 . 05 , 2 test ) .    2.641114931022578
the score yielded a rate of negative UNK and laparotomies of 14 . 3 and 12 . 3 % .    2.573713725438793
with respect to the rate of overlooked cases of acute UNK , the score demonstrated a superior performance , with only 6 cases missed ( 0 . 9 % ) .    3.0358016726528434
however , the number of patients with acute appendicitis , including those with perforated disease , who were not identified by the score , was almost four times that of the final clinical diagnosis ( 245 vs 63 ) .    2.6772949408615334
with regard to the main procedural performance parameter , the score resulted in a significantly smaller number of diagnostic errors than the provisional clinical investigator ( p < 0 . 05 , 2 test ) .    2.308119964937738
the results of this study indicate that the diagnostic scoring system might be helpful when experienced investigators or additional diagnostic modalities such as ultrasonography are not available .    2.453331975104041
it may therefore be of value in the preclinical evaluation of patients with suspected acute appendicitis and may be instrumental as a quality control tool and in clinical guidelines .    2.31224315609305
purpose : the standards and regulations concerning the protection of patients and operator staff within the context of mri are compiled .    2.3626282306167092
resulting consequences regarding physical parameters are evaluated .    2.3939321765861656
replacement of the tracheal conduit remains an unresolved problem .    2.6202071906010764
the microporous material expanded UNK ( eptfe ) is suitable for tracheal reconstruction .    2.2781815937681515
the aim of our study was to improve the limited mechanical properties of this material by incorporating reinforcement elements and to examine the influence of these elements on host incorporation and UNK .    2.408499288254281
in so UNK eptfe prostheses were reinforced with ionomer cement and porous high density polyethylene ( UNK ) rings and implanted into the neck muscle of UNK pigs .    2.061622068260741
one of these prostheses was epithelialized by a cell seeding technique and was thus placed into a tracheal defect .    2.0037462366296426
results were examined grossly by endoscopy and than by light and scanning electron microscopy .    2.2161798042344683
the shapes of both types of prostheses showed a high stability .    2.5046807340722923
the reinforcement elements did not impair UNK or the ability to UNK .    2.7268326230130233
in vivo interposition of an incorporated and epithelialized prosthesis to a host led to cell differentiation .    2.024822002967931
the improved biomechanical properties of the prostheses UNK and the reproducible formation of UNK are important advances in the solution of effectively correcting tracheal defects .    2.579059245477296
primary infection with human herpesviruses 6 and 7 ( hhv - 6 and hhv - 7 ) during early childhood causes permanent latent infection , usually without any ill effects ; only a small percentage of primary infections will lead to exanthem UNK .    1.9832107924582978
like other herpesviruses , hhv - 6 and hhv - 7 can be reactivated at any time if host defence mechanisms become defective ( e . g .    1.8577216408852106
in transplant recipients , aids , tumour patients ) .    2.292646675180408
in addition , the reactivated virus may influence the course of autoimmune and proliferative diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and hodgkin ' s disease .    2.282845677673879
while , hhv - 7 may be associated with similar disorders , more systematic studies are needed to clarify the clinical implications and the pathogenetic mechanisms of both viruses .    2.3201691591560665
pulmonary artery catheterization ( pac ) is widely used for monitoring and optimization of hemodynamic therapy in critically ill patients .    2.1557328653077565
despite its widespread use there is no clear evidence that morbidity and mortality can be reduced by this approach .    2.960198743965717
in contrast , it has been suggested that pac might increase mortality .    2.517057033415143
available data do not allow the definitive omission of pac in medical intensive care , nor do they justify its widespread use .    2.205444165441209
possible reasons that might affect outcome are catheter - related complications and often misinterpretation due to insufficient knowledge about pac .    2.289510771941109
open questions on the influence of pac on outcome variables in critically ill patients have to be answered by conducting randomized controlled trials .    2.910130552935107
beforehand , knowledge about pac has to be improved .    3.211809809237525
as a consequence , pac should be performed whenever a specific hemodynamic question arises that cannot be answered by clinical judgement or by less invasive means .    2.1944657579267086
it is important that the investigator be experienced in catheter placement and data interpretation to avoid harm to these critically ill patients .    1.9780051499328177
a long - term goal of assisted reproduction techniques should be the development of methods which are able to replace the high - dose stimulation with UNK in order to limit the costs and risks of in vitro fertilization treatment .    3.162035784360072
the in vitro maturation of immature oocytes derived from follicular UNK and the in vitro growth of early follicles isolated from ovary biopsies are discussed as possible alternatives .    2.4522945821801496
both methods are able to shift the application of stimulating hormones from the in vivo to an in vitro level , but are today still far away from being established in clinical routine .    2.389777200954574
the exact knowledge of the topographic anatomy of the urethra as well as the macro - and microcirculation of the penis [ 6 ] are the basics of reconstructive urethral surgery .    2.6030065349458837
adherence to the fundamentals and principles of tissue transfer [ 5 ] are necessary to UNK conditions for successful treatment of the various disorders of the male urethra .    2.914620721180153
UNK description of the anatomy of the male urethra in conjunction with external male genitals is necessary because of developmental similarities as well as the close anatomical relationship .    2.6485128563822364
the arterial and venous blood supply of the urethra and the penis have to be taken into account if vascularized flaps from the penile skin or the prepuce are used in urethral reconstruction .    2.384139340687331
the dual arterial and venous UNK of the genital skin is of fundamental importance to a successful outcome of the operative treatment .    3.0342894839651007
the purpose of this article is , to summarize the relevant anatomical knowledge of reconstructive urethral surgery .    2.1671758426546033
in this study the course of osteochondritis dissecans at two often affected areas , the femoral condyles of the knee joint and the talus at the upper ankle joint , is evaluated by studying and comparing the medium - term outcome in 40 patients treated conservatively and 72 patients treated surgically by arthroscopy .    2.3384556552100397
the criterion of assessment was magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , which shows a close correlation to the arthroscopic stages of osteochondritis .    2.4615110691324764
the stages on mri follow the morphology of the interface , i . e . , the zone between the osteochondral fragment and the parent bone , on t1 - and t2 - weighted images .    1.9997148802290834
after 18 and 24 months there were no substantial differences visible on mri between the two different treatment groups .    2.5819661319060274
in fact , in the majority of cases ( > 60 % ) the mri result was the same in spite of the treatment that had been carried out .    3.1677273525161627
arthroscopic treatment compared to conservative treatment resulted in a small percentage in a UNK in the sense of UNK on the mri ( 36 % to 30 % ) ; nevertheless , a disintegration could not be avoided in all cases ( 4 % ) .    3.48717465498722
in both treatment groups the age of the patient seems to play an important role in the course of osteochondritis , juvenile forms following a milder course than adult forms .    2.561719103603578
the number of women with congenital cardiac disease , who mature into adulthood is increasing .    2.502498005491049
unfortunately , there are no prospective data published about the relative risk of different forms of contraception for these patients .    2.50430631616863
most women with congenital cardiac disease can safely use oral UNK , especially low - estrogen combination or progestin - only preparations , with the exception of those , who are at particular risk because of thrombembolic complications ( especially in cyanosis , pulmonary hypertension , eisenmenger reaction , rhythm disturbances ) , fluid retention ( especially in reduced ventricular function and congestive heart failure ) , arterial hypertension ( important in coarctation ) , infectious complications ( endocarditis ) or hyperlipidemia .    1.9513616098034015
oral contraceptives should be avoided in patients at increased risk for thrombembolic events .    3.063552077543024
intrauterine devices are very effective , have no metabolic side effects and merely UNK a small risk of endocarditis .    2.229749445397062
newer devices containing progesterone only may put the patients at a still smaller risk .    2.1509103301945647
UNK UNK implants ( e . g .    2.448907883334873
UNK ) are used with good results in the united states for patients with contraindications to estrogen - containing oral contraceptives and may well become more widely accepted in patients in germany in the coming years .    2.6296642860704913
barrier methods can be used , but have a higher failure rate , which may be inacceptable in patients at risk ( e . g .    2.6340233974364384
especially in eisenmenger ' s , permanent sterilisation should be advised .    2.2670445247780804
two groups of 15 patients each with disseminated intravascular coagulation in association with septic disease were treated with low - molecular - weight heparin ( lmw - heparin ) in different dosages ( group i : 1 , 5 - 5 ie / kg body weight ( bw ) per hour ; group ii : 8 - 15 ie / kg bw ) .    2.5011494094217293
we studied the levels of d - dimer , thrombin - antithrombin iii complex ( tat ) , prothrombin fragments 1 and 2 ( ptf ) , and global tests of coagulation like prothrombin time ( pt ) , activated partial thromboplastin time ( ptt ) , thrombin time ( tt ) and platelet count , plasminogen activation ( pa ) and fibrinogen concentration to estimate the success of heparin therapy in the two groups .    2.0339882279892514
tt and fibrinogen concentration were not suitable to follow the course of the coagulation disorder .    2.7567303290934593
pt , ptt , platelet count progressively pa , d - dimer , tat , and ptf normalised progressively after heparinisation .    1.883013614340334
however , only the last three parameters were sensitive enough to show different effects of variable dosages of lmw - heparin .    2.1163419838492845
d - dimer , tat , and ptf levels declined in proportion with heparin concentrations , and thus appear to be the most useful parameters for monitoring the therapeutic effect of heparin in septic coagulopathies .    2.256347940449642
in patients with acute or chronic myocarditis , arrhythmias are a common and often the only clinical symptom in the natural course of the disease .    2.430661988748395
factors responsible for the increased incidence of cardiac arrhythmias are structural changes , parameters of ventricular dynamics and vascular changes .    2.407675127742932
on the one hand , inflammatory processes in the cardiac myocytes and interstitium can lead directly to fluctuations in membrane potential .    2.0852749529127723
fibrosis and scarring of the myocardial tissue and secondary hypertrophy and atrophy of the myocytes favor the development of ectopic pacemakers , late potentials and UNK as a result of inhomogeneous stimulus conduction .    2.5800021517329585
furthermore , parameters of ventricular dynamics such as increased wall tension , increased myocardial oxygen consumption and diminished coronary reserve in the case of disturbed systolic or diastolic left ventricular function also contribute to the increased incidence of arrhythmias .    2.1838765023655395
lastly , vascular factors can further increase the UNK of the inflamed myocardium through the disturbance of micro - and UNK perfusion and the resulting myocardial ischemia .    2.839132583103576
non - invasive UNK evaluation by 24 h holter ecg , measurement of ventricular late potentials and heart rate variability can be used for UNK risk stratification of the at - risk patient with myocarditis .    2.677859369038141
programmed atrial and ventricular electrophysiological stimulation also has a relatively high predictive value for spontaneous ventricular tachyarrhythmias .    2.526112131397273
it should be emphasized that , at the present time , optimal electrophysiological parameters with a high predictive value do not exist .    2.49270575053818
in a selected patient population , immunosuppressive therapy in addition to conventional antiarrhythmic therapy can lead to the reduction or complete suppression of spontaneous and inducible arrhythmias .    2.4933323125414466
nevertheless , in the interim , further precautionary antiarrhythmic measures such as serial antiarrhythmic treatment , vt ablation and UNK implantation are necessary in patients with malignant cardiac arrhythmias .    2.438693116433268
right ventricular myocardial biopsy for demonstration or exclusion of myocarditis is an important additional examination which can improve the differential diagnosis and treatment of patients with cardiac arrhythmias of unclear etiology .    2.7755846895989773
aim : to investigate the distribution of collagens in experimental microvascular surgery .    2.747962744646671
material and methods : autografts ( 4 mm ) of the left common carotid artery in 20 wistar rats were harvested up to 4 weeks after surgery .    2.559390252625798
the specimens were investigated immunohistochemically for the demonstration and distribution of collagen iii and iv .    2.388567533624033
results : the demonstration and distribution pattern of collagens was a function of the accuracy of each single suture .    2.658408231627196
in the intima , the organisation and amount of collagen iv was directed to the lumen and dependent on the distance and vitality of the vessel segments .    2.2268792978095813
the media had in its axis direction the lowest reparative potential for UNK the continuity break .    2.220378558084824
the adventitia formed a thick cuff around the anastomosis , in which collagen iii and iv - positive vasa vasorum had grown in a circular fashion .    2.11095310606562
the marked UNK hyperplasia in the area around the anastomosis and in the entire autograft was made up of collagen - positive extracellular matrix .    2.4909233855719433
conclusions : our results support the demand for a careful and atraumatic suture technique in microvascular surgery .    2.206175631590132
the identification of collagens in rat vessels is a valuable tool for studying wound healing in experimental microsurgery .    2.366363912329608
we treated UNK patients with invasive malignant melanoma were treated up to 1995 .    2.5644539695745587
three had second primary tumors with greater thickness .    2.372871021484885
one case showed metastasis from another tumor .    2.37627731106883
in two cases the metastases were not ascertained histologically .    2.4850644715258414
the remaining 39 cases showed some peculiarities : a greater proportion of late and of internal ( as contrasted to regional ) metastases .    1.9197060697718424
most of these primary tumors had a breslow thickness of more than 0 . 5 mm and were clark level iii or even iv .    2.4336490379719087
male patients and primary tumor sites in the area of head and neck were significantly over - represented .    2.6581063485396244
in this paper the question is considered to what extent the patient ' s and analyst ' s perception and tolerance of both aggressive and destructive elements of the analytic relationship can be increased .    2.5147886904919527
successful interpretation enables the patient to feel , enact and UNK animosity in the transference and experience that the relationship can continue .    2.0620489545710474
the concept of primary aggression developed in freud ' s UNK on death UNK is discussed in its clinical function of relief .    2.5100595206800573
the UNK concept of primary aggression facilitates work on aggressive and especially destructive developments of the relationship .    2.1289204626551994
freud ' s and subsequently UNK ' s examination of the UNK of destructiveness and narcissism opened plausible clinical UNK to explain the compensation of defence mechanisms against UNK ' s vulnerability in the face of mortality .    2.9054865514409163
since aggressiveness is often concomitant with fear and suppressed UNK , interpretation plays a decisive role in relieving the superego strain ; more confrontation may involve the analyst in the role of the UNK .    2.0587517736020295
sudden and UNK feelings of UNK towards the analyst require careful treatment of the patient ' s irritation .    2.8790025438213633
interpretation of genetic causes of animosity often prove to be countertransference resistance ; interpretation in transference , however , is viewed as UNK .    2.2240843795963277
finally , those dangerous and destructive phases of treatments are discussed , which UNK the analyst to protect the setting .    2.5065520529666867
background : respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) is the most common viral agent of severe lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children throughout the world .    2.3175871272153024
highest hospitalization rates are seen in the second and third month of life .    3.0277978547940414
young infants , especially those with predisposing conditions such as prematurity , UNK dysplasia ( bpd ) , chronic lung disease ( cld ) , congenital heart disease , cystic fibrosis or immunodeficiency , are the pediatric patients at increased risk for severe rsv disease .    2.1508045595703584
specific therapeutic options for rsv are limited .    2.6279196507211506
in this prospective study we investigated the efficacy of microcatheter spinal anaesthesia in comparison with a combined spinal - epidural technique in trauma patients .    2.8142934141999767
background : in denmark , france , germany , great britain and italy , the UNK project combines clinical centers of ophthalmology and internal medicine , an institute for medical UNK and health services research , a publishing company and different industrial UNK in the UNK market .    2.24606892988289
purpose : a prospective study was initiated for the correlation of the findings in the initial cranial ct with the long - term follow - up mri in children with severe head injury .    2.882461664324642
a differentiation is made between patient information on findings and diagnosis , patient information on avoidance of known dangers , and patient information on the risks involved in a particular intervention that has been selected .    2.368454934684014
if no information is given on the risks inherent in a patient ' s condition and how she must proceed in order to ensure that they do not come about , this is considered to be a treatment error , and in these circumstances the intervention is then legally seen as bodily harm .    2.6846330119871684
information on the risks involved in an intervention must be given in good time , which generally means on the day before the operation .    2.3919676882188674
an exception is made to this rule for day surgery .    2.365582462862377
the patient must be informed about treatment alternatives when the method selected is not the method of choice or when there is an alternative offering equivalent chances but risks of a different kind .    2.466673404239348
such information is given to the adult patient who is capable of legal transactions .    2.731395976849786
in the case of minors or of patients who are not capable of legal transactions their legal representative is responsible for receiving the information [ and making decisions ] .    2.1350686278043236
in the case of unconscious patients UNK depends on " presumable consent to the operation " .    2.2656387361007306
if a patient later UNK lacks in the information supplied to her to support a claim for compensation in a situation where it would be UNK to refuse an operation , she must elaborate plausible UNK for being in conflict over the decision even following appropriate information .    1.792603348704371
within the last few years the use of point - of - care analyzers increased .    3.187540777470085
these testing is primarily performed in the emergency room , intensive care units , and in the operating room using small portable analyzers .    2.975365657613737
the fact of being UNK and working with UNK or UNK batteries and UNK cartridges caused us to use blood gas analysis in the prehospital setting .    2.4004155137316294
patients undergoing major vascular surgery frequently require a substantial intraoperative fluid replacement to assure hemodynamic stability , which is in excess of the expected fluid requirements due to UNK , blood and UNK losses .    2.3127604343718944
this leads to a positive fluid balance which can not be readily explained .    2.7849118170873375
the case of a 57 year old patient is reported , who suffered from an acute myocardial infarction with maximum ck and UNK values of 821 and 84 u / l , respectively .    2.6089113206188856
the patient underwent bicycle exercise testing 9 days after a myocardial infarction in 25 w steps every 2 min starting with 50 w . the ergometry was interrupted at 125 w because of st segment depression of 0 . 28 mv in v6 .    1.9942116434527817
systolic blood pressure dropped to 55 mm hg , combined with severe angina and shock .    2.6674557400631604
volume substitution and catecholamines did not UNK blood pressure .    2.5771752784182227
immediate m - mode and doppler echo revealed a " UNK " - shaped mitral regurgitation profile typical of acute mitral valve insufficiency .    2.3651284485669475
the transesophageal echocardiogram showed a distinct mass moving between the left ventricle and left atrium , diagnostic of papillary muscle rupture .    2.1296516283403975
despite of shock , mitral valve replacement was performed successfully .    2.5419199437393987
to our knowledge , this is the first report of a papillary muscle rupture during exercise testing after myocardial infarction .    2.1512610992814887
the flow directed balloon - tipped pulmonary artery catheter introduced by UNK and UNK 1970 has made possible the measurement of filling pressures in the heart and is extensively used in operating rooms , in catheterization laboratories and in intensive care units .    2.2795263057523214
the rupture of the pulmonary artery is an uncommon complication associated with a high mortality rate exceeding 50 percent .    3.237453938994164
main symptoms are cough , hemoptysis , dyspnea and cardiac shock .    2.2528354563094215
complications occur if guidelines for the safe use of the balloon - tipped catheters are not strictly followed : excessive catheter manipulation , advancing the catheter tip too far peripherally and leaving the UNK balloon in the wedge position for long periods should be avoided .    1.9872037766715045
on 90 patients with 93 unstable fractures of the thoracic spine and the thoracolumbar junction we treated by a minimal invasive procedure between may 1996 and april 1998 , in 46 patients an endoscopic splitting of the diaphragm was performed .    2.4066683879648956
the diaphragma was dissected at its attachment at the spine and the adjoining UNK base .    2.2738352429026705
an additional stabilization was done by using a plate and screw system .    2.767983785996939
the incision of the diaphragm was closed by suturing or using an universal UNK .    2.273456595885542
controlling the postoperative results a complete closure of the incision was documented by x - ray and ct - scan .    2.6278998963372957
there was no conversion to the open procedure or postoperative infection .    2.427525945090707
splitting the diaphragma opens also the thoracolumbar junction to a minimal invasive treatment and stabilization of fractures .    2.4294484710570647
this is a report of an interdisciplinary approach to diagnosis and treatment of stroke , combining a stroke unit and rehabilitation in one clinic .    2.43374349246773
this series contains unselected patients from a narrow surrounding .    2.473262049271651
mean age of UNK patients was 68 . 7 years ( median 70 years ) .    2.9952908374549416
25 % of patients had an initial barthel index of < 30 , 20 % presented with UNK ' s and UNK ' s .    3.391713130154671
9 % suffered from cerebral hemorrhage .    2.513352766987403
the UNK chain of care allowed a relative short length of stay in the acute care ( 9 . 4 days ) without prolonging the rehabilitation phase .    2.4980029111815765
the one month mortality was 6 . 7 % , one year mortality 18 . 3 % .    2.935087451537034
discharge to a nursing home was necessary in 5 . 4 % .    2.826862867157373
overall more than 90 % of our patients have been treated continuously in our clinic .    3.1687313888279567
combining modern diagnostics with early onset rehabilitation seem advantageous .    2.356618615754846
about 220 knee endoprostheses are implanted at our clinic annually .    2.323492554691082
this is a routine procedure for the instrument staff .    2.5785910537570755
practice has shown , however , that deficient operating room management as regards the instruments , implants , operating room staff , and surgical planning causes problems .    2.3356765751952473
as a result of this , a prophylactic search for sources of error began ( risk management ) .    2.151179914254893
if the sources of error are found , described , and remedied , knee endoprosthetic surgery will be successful for both the patient and the surgical team .    2.5161733198461786
cooperation and communication among manufacturer , surgeon , and surgical nursing staff should serve to minimize forensic risks .    2.1784590945374145
UNK are epithelial pathogens UNK for causing persistent infection .    2.234899163598528
a bacterial contribution to atherosclerosis appears more relevant if the UNK mesenchymal cells of the vascular wall that constitute the plaque can support chlamydial infection continuously .    2.090629308142295
the study consists of a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy .    2.9585646314719516
besides medical and sociodemographic data , two personality factors - self - efficacy and locus of control - were found to predict postoperative pain .    2.261161227720324
self - efficacy describes the expectations of a person to successfully UNK the behavior required to produce behavioral outcomes .    2.189246457510843
locus of control , in the extreme case , is a personality factor which is represented by an internal orientation in which the individual believes that rewards are brought about by his own action , versus an external orientation , in which the individual believes that rewards are the result of powerful others or chance factors and fate .    2.1495826158755986
we postulate that the two personality factors correlate with postoperative parameters of pain and that there are also multiple correlations between them .    2.337932863830559
at present there is neither an completely UNK biomaterial available , nor does a universal test exist which objectively evaluates biocompatibility .    1.8570108354365338
one reason is the individuality of the host , especially with regard to the inflammatory response .    2.8688992579002823
inflammation was found to induce biodegradation by hydrolysis or auto - oxidation of vascular prosthetic matrix after implantation .    2.135974535959561
the present study was performed to investigate the specific humoral immune response after implantation of segments of a collagen - UNK UNK prosthesis ( dacron ) in UNK / c mice on experimental days 1 , 18 , 38 , and 322 .    2.2889471065772495
serum antibody detection was performed by modified enzyme immunoassay using the prosthesis as a target .    2.4232634287314365
specific polymer antibodies , enhanced by repeated implantations , could be detected in all mice which received grafts up to experimental day 322 .    2.234444612403428
these antibodies were not directed against the collagen coating .    2.4788885621819037
the antibody formation could be further enhanced by a combined administration of complete UNK ' s adjuvant together with the first implantation at experimental day 1 .    2.4042969164427177
results suggest that specific polymer antibodies , reflecting an inflammatory response , might be an additional parameter for biocompatibility testing of vascular prostheses .    2.2998081874422955
twenty - nine unicondylar fractures of the distal femur were treated at the trauma center " bergmannsheil " , university of bochum , germany , between 1981 and 1994 .    2.5252576638028197
all patients sustained their injuries from severe direct trauma .    2.212229393837704
there were 16 lateral condylar fractures , 7 medial condylar fractures and 6 tangential posterior ( " UNK - type " ) fractures .    2.2047895539059903
twenty - eight closed injuries and 1 grade iiib open fracture were included .    2.117404597159504
eleven patients sustained concomitant injuries to the skeleton .    2.7287600228580993
all fractures were treated with open reduction and internal fixation with screws within 8 h of admission .    2.8203711085751326
postoperative management consisted of early continuous passive motion and minimal weight - bearing for 6 - 8 weeks , progressing to full weight - bearing .    2.432493651374122
the mean follow - up was 68 months ( 18 - 120 ) .    2.5402951218492165
the therapeutic outcome ( clinical result , radiographs ) was rated by the neer score .    2.144320161114252
twenty - seven patients were available for follow - up examination .    3.248992969951364
of these , 23 were rated as excellent .    2.4487804647549964
3 achieved satisfactory results , and 1 had an unsatisfactory result .    2.6790331135283654
all patients who did not achieve an excellent outcome had had accompanying injuries .    2.2629820078876155
open reduction and internal screw fixation of unicondylar femur fractures provided overall excellent long - term results .    2.366296585192841
the therapeutic outcome was significantly affected by associated injuries of the skeleton .    2.579205710326938
the realization that a disease will not respond to a curative treatment causes massive fear and anxiety in affected patients , but also feelings of helplessness and insecurity in health professionals caring for the patients .    2.2472113651044814
the global fears of affected patients can be divided into three main categories of problems ; stepwise UNK of these problems may help to maintain or restore an UNK high quality of life according to the who guidelines for palliative medicine .    2.3970547556143864
in light of the anxiety felt by physicians and others caring for this patient group , palliative psycho - oncology must offer patient - centered UNK care in which the psycho - oncologist is not an isolated therapist but rather a member of a team made up of physicians , nurses , religious workers , psychologists , UNK , physiotherapists , social workers , and especially family members .    2.107569866140577
together , this group of health professionals and family members caring for the affected patient form a group that itself receives care as needed .    2.1434436366298395
UNK - chiari syndrome ( bcs ) with hepatic vein occlusion is a rare disorder that can effectively be treated in advanced stages with orthotopic liver transplantation .    2.2033435093725546
we report on 16 patients who received 18 liver grafts and were followed up for at least 2 years .    2.4217089697938
in 7 patients a hematological disorder was confirmed by bone marrow biopsy .    2.710730887293877
one patient died after 4 months due to cytomegalovirus pneumonia ; another patient died after 2 years due to progressive liver failure after portal vein thrombosis .    2.1875582893651044
the actuarial 5 - year survival rate is 87 . 5 % compared to 85 . 3 % in all other 710 orthotopic liver transplantations performed from september 1988 to december 1995 at our institution .    2.566923252517638
anticoagulation consisted of intravenous heparin and overlapping continuation with dicoumarin .    2.277000213349541
three patients received hydroxyurea for thrombocytosis , one patient for 1 week only early after the transplantation .    2.1640621853511646
two postoperative abdominal hemorrhages required laparotomy .    2.411636221875325
terminal bcs represents a good indication for orthotopic liver transplantation ; however , life - long , closely monitored anticoagulation is essential .    2.309302564454169
postmenopausal estrogen - replacement therapy maintains bone density as assessed by densitometry of skeletal sites relevant for future fracture .    2.098516722215732
optimal doses are 2 mg oral estradiol , 0 . UNK mg conjugated UNK estrogens , 1 . 25 mg UNK and 50 µg transdermal estradiol .    2.4717293908317006
there is a role for calcium supplementation in individuals with non - optimal dietary intake of calcium .    2.3872105451845
observational studies suggest that estrogen replacement reduces the future risk for hip fracture by 25 % .    2.332254745054902
discontinuation of replacements is associated with an increase of fracture risk few years later .    2.947840640441957
it is noteworthy that there is a lack of formal fracture studies providing data on the efficacy of estrogen replacement for primary prevention of osteoporosis and for secondary prevention in terms of treatment of women with established osteoporosis , with a diagnosis based on who criteria .    2.6129578030920597
UNK , a selective estrogen receptor modulator , and UNK , a synthetic steroid with weak estrogenic , UNK and UNK properties , may constitute alternatives to estrogen - replacement therapy .    2.88190653343052
UNK maintains bone density in and reduces UNK fractures by some 50 % in women with prevalent osteoporosis .    2.3647812721298376
artificial insemination from donor ( heterologous insemination ) is a rationally based treatment in complete male infertility .    2.272663510293772
in this overview the enlarged knowledge on semen donors , the receiving couples and the development of the offspring will be summarized .    2.190283287086435
although motivation of men towards semen donation is predominantly based on financial expectancy , most of the donors agree to offer the offspring not - identifiable information on biological and social characteristics .    1.9288370984664174
semen donation does not enhance the risk of consanguinity and of genetic diseases in the population .    2.572984594584743
the decision to undergo heterologous insemination is a burden for the couples .    2.1861831633047726
retrospectively , however , the majority state positive influences of the insemination on their partnership .    3.009631333987103
the most important question is whether they should disclose the insemination to the children .    2.2108129280248314
the course of the pregnancy and the postnatal development of the children do not differ from those of children of natural UNK .    2.72166537970976
they receive more love and care than " usual " children .    2.0532638597042125
their rights concerning the insemination , however , are poorly considered .    2.787047807344352
if we agree that the knowledge of genetic descent is part of human rights , non - disclosure of the donor insemination to the children raises severe ethical problems .    2.1384628440793603
the extended field of view imaging procedure named " UNK " provides , for the first time , a mode of establishing in real time a sonographic picture up to 60 cm in length .    2.196880956038267
this allows the display of large organs or tumors as well as large areas of the body in a single view , without having to assemble several pictures .    2.4334417560258896
furthermore , pathological find - UNK can be shown in full size in their UNK .    2.416141695084571
this method makes it considerably easier to convey sonographic results to the therapist who is not present at the investigation and to control a finding , for instance a tumor , during therapy .    2.0370712393560026
heart rate variability ( hrv ) has been established as an important risk parameter in patients surviving myocardial UNK .    2.6658760970221556
recently , analysis of hrv - particularly of the standard deviation of UNK intervals ( sdnn ) - from short term ecg recordings has been proposed as an alternative to that from 24 hour holter UNK .    2.2558295531873913
the present study is the first to compare sdnn from short term recordings to that from 24 hour recordings with respect to risk stratification after myocardial infarction .    2.46170703931793
in 60 patients at the time of discharge from the hospital , sdnn from holter monitoring averaged 93 + / - 30 ms compared to 39 + / - 18 determined from short term recordings .    2.723633006768441
patients with a prospectively defined clinical endpoint differed significantly from those with an uneventful course with respect to age , left ventricular ejection fraction , mean rr interval from holter recording ( UNK + / - 153 vs UNK + / - 132 ms ) , mean rr from short term recording ( UNK + / - 153 vs UNK + / - 163 ms ) , and sdnn from the holter recording ( 71 + / - 27 vs 97 + / - 29 ms ; p < 0 . 001 ) however , patients with and without clinical event could not be UNK by means of sdnn measured from short term ecg UNK ( 35 + / - 22 vs 41 + / - 19 ms ; p = UNK ) .    2.7615916644389884
thus , sdnn measured from short term ecg recordings does not seem to be useful regarding risk stratification of patients after myocardial infarction .    2.3922884395624497
analysis of hrv should be performed using 24 hour holter monitoring , which provides more information and reflects circadian UNK in autonomic tone .    2.2333185414160948
glomus tumors ( glomangiomata ) are benign tumors arising from glomus cells .    2.1842421397562797
multiple glomangiomata are less frequent and less painful than the solitary variant , which is usually located UNK .    2.5363909389189288
nonetheless multiple glomangiomata - sometimes being sensitive to pressure and changes in temperature - may cause considerable discomfort .    2.179756586848774
treatment of multiple glomangiomata is problematic because of the often large number of tumors .    3.169314912965619
sclerotherapy represents an alternative to surgical and UNK therapy .    2.8064397861575374
we report on sclerotherapy in a 35 year old female patient with multiple hereditary glomus tumors .    2.348066999428592
conventional echocardiographic methods of measuring left ventricular mass ( lvm ) are limited by assumptions of ventricular geometry and image plane positioning .    2.051349191629932
three - dimensional ( 3d ) echocardiography offers a promising new approach for more accurate determination of lvm .    2.290454617181654
this study was performed to compare lvm measurement by one - ( UNK ) , two - ( 2d ) , and 3d echocardiography with magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in patients ( pts ) with dilated cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) .    2.796362125844687
determination of functional residual capacity ( frc ) can be performed through washout methods , indicator gas dilution or UNK .    2.24957981153675
some of these techniques have been adapted for use in intensive care patients whilst being mechanically ventilated .    2.8369435599570667
however , most measurement UNK are bulky , UNK to use and their running costs are high .    2.190801532616297
hence frc measurement has not become a routine method in intensive care although it offers considerable advantages in the management of ventilated patients such as the determination of " best peep " , the detection of progressive alveolar collapse in the course of acute lung injury and during weaning from mechanical ventilation .    2.442502213024608
up to now most efforts to improve and simplify frc measurement were made at the expense of accuracy .    2.0314909124643004
an ideal method ought to be accurate , easy to handle and cost - effective .    2.362598976109516
it should supply not only frc data but also information about intrapulmonary gas distribution and dead space .    2.026058719421018
these demands can be met using modern data acquisition software .    2.2258871337459594
the pros and cons of all methods available for frc measurement are discussed in view of their suitability for intensive care patients .    2.5473015194004525
a conventional nitrogen washout using emission spectroscopy for measurement of nitrogen concentration gives satisfying exact values for the determination of the parameters mentioned above .    2.274898238011598
the measurement error can be lowered under 5 % by special corrections for flow and nitrogen signal ( delay and rise times , changes of gas viscosity ) .    1.865192893880864
for flow measurement a normal UNK can be used .    3.3560124490839986
using a UNK computer for data acquisition the bed - side monitor fulfills most of the demands in intensive care .    2.4204621037035996
it is then also possible to measure indices of intrapulmonary gas distribution such as alveolar mixing efficiency and lung clearance index .    1.9988839091311674
three strategies are followed in handling the key issue within the field of action of care and services for the elderly : securing the material needs of those requiring care , creating appropriate care structures , and providing an effective counselling back - up to alleviate interface problems .    2.0623050744105957
UNK latter , process - oriented aids , have been the subject of discussion and further development under the key term of case management for a good decade .    2.48971478687101
the aim in this context is to prevent the elderly from being unnecessarily moved into UNK care , to stop the UNK door syndrome , to ensure that older people can stay in their homes , to support family members acting as care providers , to enhance the quality of services and those to ease the strain on fund providers .    2.0030837981639107
in the context of case managment , these diverse tasks are performed by three basic UNK functions : the UNK , UNK , and advocacy functions .    2.7141927519263125
each of these three functions characterizes the main variants of case management with a different weighting ( care management , community care , managed care and case management as a counselling approach with a particular focus on individual help ) .    2.005022365376714
bullous pemphigoid ( bp ) is a bullous autoimmune disease of the elderly ; it is characterized by tense bullae on both erythematous and otherwise apparently normal skin .    2.7189249190705542
several clinical variants of bp have been described , and we now add our observations of two bp cases mimicking subacute prurigo .    2.2342788867355843
both patients had suffered from intensely pruritic UNK papules for several months before presentation .    2.3315754791373022
blisters had never developed and did not occur during follow up .    2.745241081331508
histology showed changes of chronic dermatitis .    2.5934328625069836
in the serum of both patients , indirect immunofluorescence on nacl - separated human skin revealed the presence of circulating antibodies binding to the roof of the artificial blisters .    2.3322044148061005
UNK skin biopsies showed linear igg or c3 deposits in the basement membran zone .    2.1528263848192934
UNK of epidermal and dermal extracts demonstrated the binding of the antibodies to an epidermal 230 - kd protein , which is the known major bullous pemphigoid antigen .    2.064418877363998
these cases are described as a basis for discussion of the clinical spectrum of bullous pemphigoid .    3.3294836603567832
the distal metatarsal osteotomy according to magerl allows correction of a hallux valgus deformity by lateral and plantar displacement as well as by pronation and varisation .    2.2541451218623823
the length of the first metatarsal can be adjusted by the depth of the cut at the resection or by a slightly oblique osteotomy .    2.458968879025157
if necessary , soft tissue release and / or a osteotomy of the first proximal phalanx can be done to UNK the UNK under the head of the first metatarsal .    3.4890637968484755
a review of 118 foot operations in 75 patients demonstrated a very good or good result in about 75 % .    2.3261860823757816
radiological examination showed sufficient lateralisation of the metatarsal head .    2.3879392783415194
evaluating the length of the first metatarsal and the amount of variation , the results were less satisfying .    3.4645689784319513
the metatarsophalangeal angles could be corrected by 14 ° and the UNK angles by 7 ° on average .    2.5261978698823273
the sophisticated operative procedure limits the use of this technique as a standard procedure .    3.0396350847594134
the contribution of rudolf virchow to dermatology seems to have been UNK , or present - day dermatologists are not aware of it .    2.3275681568114233
the present historical review is intended to show that virchow ' s UNK and the terminology created by him are still alive .    2.6787222002585094
it starts with early experimental publications , which laid to the foundation for his UNK , and with dermatological studies of his early period .    2.285547990290731
this is followed by a detailed description of his contributions pertaining to dermatology in his largest work , " UNK " .    2.1957059479663834
special mention is made of virchow ' s lasting contributions to medical , and particularly dermatological , terminology .    2.0975946060366932
finally , his historical studies , his latter small publications on topics in dermatology , his pupils and scientific UNK , and the social - political and anthropological activities of later years are discussed .    2.089455478564161
thus , a UNK picture is UNK of a still modern pathologist who has influenced dermatology in multiple ways .    2.4742252626296817
starter ' s pistols are often UNK for self - defense , but can also be used for criminal activities ( e . g .    2.5141227946236593
when a starter ' s UNK is loaded with blank cartridges and is UNK , a powerful shooting noise results .    2.69124375258879
the level of the noise produced is high enough to cause acoustic trauma .    2.358997696165995
for legal examinations and giving an expert opinion further information is needed about the power of such noise .    2.153930224061963
we examined how high peak sound pressure levels were of the gunshots of blank cartridges and whether there existed any directional characteristics from the noise emissions .    1.939404117502818
in all , 15 different models of starter ' s pistols of 8 different UNK were examined .    2.1865906589072495
in addition to blank cartridges , 8 mm tear gas cartridges were also examined .    2.09079450673856
four transducers were situated in the horizontal plane around the muzzle : 0 ° ( shooting direction ) , 45 ° , 90 ° , and 180 ° ( towards the firer ) .    2.0409389848594213
the distances between the transducers and the muzzle were 25 cm , 50 cm , 100 cm , and 200 cm .    2.0331420877756066
at a shooting distance of 25 cm the peak sound pressure levels reached 181 db .    2.153295388641086
in addition , we observed a directional characteristic concerning the emission of noise : pistols produced higher peak sound pressure levels to the front than UNK towards the firer .    1.9332130403709196
owing to their rare incidence , foreign body injuries in the region of the orbit , skull base and skull have up to now mostly been treated in the literature by means of case reports .    2.8330305597177685
here we present our experience and treatment regimen for ten patients we have treated during the last 3 years .    2.737963321391091
in seven cases the foreign body was located in the orbit alone , whereas in three others the orbit and the frontal base were equally involved .    2.3082108302341116
except for one case , the foreign material could be removed completely .    2.8565656927930694
three patients suffered from partial or complete loss of vision and one patient developed a UNK during the follow - up period , but no late effects were registered in the remaining six cases .    2.8044632600829003
before removing the foreign body and carefully reconstructing the accident , however , we strongly recommend the documentation of possible functional deficits , preferably by means of photography .    2.6494565827465135
ct is the method of choice for UNK the foreign body , except for the depiction of wood particles .    2.874244831412114
here , sonography and mr should be performed .    2.5231808565505793
as the therapeutic approach , the cooperation of an interdisciplinary team of UNK , neuro - and maxillofacial surgeons seems mandatory .    2.636119194463356
to avoid inflammation , the immediate removal of the foreign material is recommended in cases with considerable intracranial lesions : post - operative neurologic and intensive care monitoring should be provided .    2.6445452697869247
treatment is completed by high - dose antibiotics , using csf - soluble substances and , if necessary , anti - UNK .    2.6020203997801183
rocuronium is a new UNK muscle relaxant for which a fast onset has been described .    2.7045404678210345
the goal of this study was to examine whether the characteristics of rocuronium could make it an appropriate relaxant for the anaesthetic management of operations of intermediate duration such as endoscopic upper airway surgery .    1.981215000285596
these operations , which require the anaesthesiologist and surgeon to " share " the patient ' s airway , require good muscle relaxation for endotracheal intubation and placement of endoscopic instruments .    2.161780680556188
in addition , the time course of neuromuscular blockade and its relation to the quality of intubating conditions were analysed .    2.864082056105518
patients and methods : in order to better define the potential advantages and risks of laser in situ keratomileusis ( lasik ) , we designed a prospective study including 73 eyes .    2.54344037378734
treatment of UNK atrial fibrillation ( af ) is difficult in patients with congestive heart failure because many drugs which exert negative dromotropic effects ( beta - blockers , calcium channel antagonists ) may depress ventricular contractility and / or decrease arterial blood pressure .    2.3963123925889733
we have identified 2 intravascular sites in the superior ( svc ) and inferior vena cava ( ivc ) where parasympathetic nerves , which UNK the atrioventricular node , can be stimulated electrically .    2.2168190114670296
in 8 dogs , a 7 - f catheter with an expandable electrode UNK at its tip was non - UNK positioned in the svc and in the proximal ivc ( time for positioning : 3 - 5 minutes ) .    2.3468286652563886
high - frequency electrical parasympathetic stimulation ( ps ) with 20 hz at an impulse duration of 0 . 1 ms was performed during pacing induced af .    2.200698036464895
results : with increasing stimulus strength , a graded ventricular rate slowing was observed during ps in the svc and ivc ( p < 0 . 01 , anova ) .    2.1341177609332256
the negative dromotropic effect started instantaneously after onset of ps and UNK immediately after termination of ps .    2.29783644021032
during ventricular pacing at a constant rate , no decrease of the arterial blood pressure was observed during ps .    2.838820991056884
ps in the ivc yielded significantly lower stimulation thresholds than in the svc .    2.628863183940074
conclusions : transvenous parasympathetic stimulation for ventricular rate control during af can easily be achieved in the svc and ivc in dogs .    2.1880148032446463
this procedure may provide a foundation for investigating the usefulness of ps in humans .    2.3448300802033315
if the results translate to patients , ps may be very beneficial in the treatment of af in patients with congestive heart failure .    2.617339282085487
a total of 86 patients suffering from fractures of the thoracolumbar spine were followed up after an average time period of 57 months ( 12 - 98 ) .    2.7434172724074166
of these patients , 56 were treated operatively and 30 conservatively .    2.8409789095647007
according to the ao / asif classification , 66 % of the operated group were fractures of type a , 29 % of type b , and 5 % of type c . all patients were operated on by means of dorsal locking instrumentation with UNK fixation and , apart from six patients , with transpedicular cancellous bone grafting .    2.8358046873054668
the conservative group was treated according to the guidelines of UNK with closed reduction , plaster cast , and rehabilitation program .    2.686522376892653
all fractures in the conservative group were of type a .    3.072576930058446
charcot foot in its original sense is equivalent to stage 4 of hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy ( hmsn ) which is known as charcot - marie - tooth disease since UNK .    1.9173845981867208
this entity , which can be subdivided into 3 groups including subgroups , predominantly begins during childhood and progresses slowly .    2.2993104465766003
the first symptom , often unnoticed by the patient for a long period , is weakness of the intrinsic foot muscles with consecutive hammer - toe formation and mobile pes cavus .    2.312196733911852
UNK atrophy of the peroneal , extensor , tibialis posterior and finally triceps surae muscles leads to fixed pes cavus varus UNK with severe varus deformity of the hindfoot , secondary varus position of the talus at the ankle level and subsequent arthrosis of the medial compartment .    2.145318697641208
permanent varus deformity of the ankle almost invariably leads to stress fractures of the malleoli because of repetitive UNK ( stage 5 of hmsn ) .    2.3863570316124654
the alveolar adenoma of the lung is a rare benign tumor in which the normal parenchymal UNK is UNK by a proliferation of both the alveolar epithelial cells and the mesenchymal septal cells .    2.9685275834165377
the first description , based on six cases , was published in 1986 by UNK and UNK .    2.614614684186825
from their ultrastructural findings they presumed a type ii pneumocytes differentiation of the epithelial cells .    2.417731594523746
we investigated an alveolar adenoma of the lung UNK by means of antibodies against UNK b and c of human surfactant .    2.545372907745615
both the lining cells and the macrophages in the alveolar - like spaces were stained .    2.43729641746437
the septal connection tissue cells did not react .    2.3712396016494752
these findings confirm the expression of surfactant UNK and , hence , the differentiation into type ii pneumocytes of the epithelial cells of the alveolar adenoma .    2.6913332248336337
breast cancer is the most frequent malignant tumor in women , whereas it is rare in men .    3.028147699661479
in our own case series the ratio is 175 : 1 .    2.4842456583627692
the present paper deals with an evaluation of clinical and morphological findings from a series of 54 de novo male breast cancers observed in our institution from 1978 to 1996 and a comparative discussion of 528 female breast cancers from the same geographic area .    2.1189893011232486
we should like to focus on the following observations :    2.8810980192347055
patients with congenital varicella syndrome develop cicatricial skin lesions and UNK .    2.4979113318997426
an overlap in the clinical manifestations exist with a specific genetic disorder , called UNK syndrome .    2.472453180902988
it is due to a partial deletion of the short arm from chromosome x , with consecutive monosomy UNK . 3 .    2.7041689233202777
the rapid development of recombinant dna technology and our enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of human disease has facilitated the development of new molecular therapeutic modalities , termed gene therapy .    2.4085161265871506
gene therapy involves the transfer of functional genes into somatic cells and their expression in target tissues in order to replace absent genes , correct defective genes , or induce UNK activity in the tumor - bearing host .    2.18995815440312
currently , an increasing number of gene therapy strategies are being investigated in experimental and clinical trials .    2.603467595993715
despite substantial progress , a number of technical and logistical UNK must still be overcome before gene therapy can be safely and effectively applied in the human patient .    2.386563406876967
since gene therapy involves complex cell processing and can be time consuming and costly , simplifications or even alternative approaches will be necessary in order to establish this therapy as suitable for clinical use .    2.348853651262773
this report reviews various gene therapy UNK and gene delivery techniques currently under clinical or experimental investigation .    2.0021053681452634
special emphasis is given to cytokine gene therapy using gene - modified tumor vaccines for cancer treatment .    2.092484448021512
using the ptb simulator , which UNK real signals from patients , we examined the precision of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement with the dinamap 1846 ( critikon ) and the hp m - 1008b ( hewlett packard ) .    2.283392633552
for this purpose we simultaneously registered invasive arterial UNK , cuff pressure and cuff pressure oscillations of 20 patients from our intensive care unit and stored them in the database of the simulator .    2.0636965245240115
the invasive reference blood pressure values were determined following the recommendations given by the association for the advancement of medical instrumentation .    2.257859308583052
the invasive system showed a cut - off frequency of 35 hz ; the UNK constant was 0 . 21 .    2.374073513951891
with 49 record signals from patients we carried out 15 simulated measurements each .    2.242638314238072
from a total of 49 bio - signals from patients the dinamap 1846 was able to process 41 signals and the hp m - 1008b 47 signals .    2.1945487581240686
the mean error of the oscillometric blood pressure measurement of the systolic , diastolic and mean arterial pressure amounted to - 2 . 50 mmhg , 3 . 35 mmhg ( p < 0 . 05 ) and 1 . 51 mmhg with the dinamap 1846 and to - 8 . 5 mmhg ( p < 0 . 001 ) , - 5 . 15 mmhg ( p < 0 . 001 ) and - 5 . 58 mmhg ( p < 0 . 001 ) for the hp m - 1008b .    2.396846456067118
the 95 % confidence limit for the systolic , diastolic and the mean arterial pressure amounts to 56 mmhg , 30 mmhg and 35 mmhg for the dinamap 1846 and 50 mmhg , 38 mmhg and 35 mmhg for the hp m - 1008b .    1.9414257678425186
the differences between that two instruments could be caused by the different algorithms for the calculation of blood pressure values and different UNK detection and elimination techniques .    2.4626633119590227
the results of the performance tests we achieved with the ptb simulator correspond to the results of other clinical examinations .    2.5412788519354677
the american association for the UNK of medical instrumentation recommends a maximum mean error of 5 + / - 8 mmhg .    3.1251727309459647
none of the examined instruments lay within these limits .    2.3888796015094327
many patients consulting medical emergency services make the initial contact because of psychiatric emergency situations .    2.090907107586314
however , emergency physicians and their assistants are usually not sufficiently experienced in psychiatry .    2.1935936235039346
therefore , psychiatric emergencies are sometimes only UNK accepted or UNK treated by these services .    2.103709604784653
our present contribution aims at improving this situation .    2.3365900916905056
it gives a review of the main diagnostic groups concerned , their symptomatology and psychopathology , and offers some advice with regard to empathic verbal interventions and counselling in those emergency situations .    2.213910425147263
3 different types of complex spinal trauma are defined : type i means a multilevel contiguous or non contiguous unstable injury , type ii is described as a spinal injury with concommitant thoracic or abdominal lesion , typ iii stands for the coincidence of spinal injury and polytrauma .    2.0651334590132198
overlapping of different types occurs .    2.9542803459232534
type i : the incidence amounts according a german multicenter study to about 2 , 5 % .    2.544047189161657
multilevel injuries need to be stabilized for a long distance from posterior .    2.8307077739880246
with a UNK analysis the segments to be fused are determined .    2.828415535513085
typ ii : the leading thoracic injury is a lung contusion which occurs in up to 50 % of the cases .    2.4994527242369773
a ct scan of the thorax during the first diagnostic screening is recommended .    2.6619111978104106
early reduction and stabilization from posterior should be aimed at .    2.4483043955615935
during the first two weeks anterior procedures are contraindicated .    2.5759005114691527
abdominal injuries are to be found in 3 - 4 % of all spinal injuries .    3.6005323317686195
all organs could be affected .    2.687062425579844
a typical UNK is the " seat - UNK syndrome " with lesions of the upper abdominal organs and a UNK injury of the upper lumbar spine .    3.4486212771889524
the main problem is to make the diagnosis of both components initially .    2.979932545749771
most of the patients may be treated in one operation by first taking care of the abdominal injury and than UNK the spine .    2.882130918041139
the prognosis of this combination is favorable .    2.748554865077136
typ iii : in 17 - 18 % of all polytraumatized patients lesions of the spine are to be diagnosed .    3.268399956090103
from these only one third need surgical care .    2.453590632547158
from 680 patients with operatively treated fractures of the thoracolumbar junction 6 , 2 % were polytraumatized according to the multicenter study mentioned above .    2.752534443896473
the risk of missing a spinal injury in polytrauma UNK approximately 20 % .    2.4722711422276316
surgical stabilization should be performed in the primary phase ( day - 1 - surgery ) .    3.166890507091953
additional injuries , potentially time consuming operations with a high blood loss sometimes necessitate a different approach .    2.5181153587149607
non stabilized spinal injuries apparently do not have the same negative effect on the whole organism as long bone fractures .    2.364150225942878
in the early phase of treatment on the c - spine only anterior procedures and on the thoraco - lumbar spine only posterior techniques should be applied .    2.4571600876223205
experimental studies have shown that in traffic accidents with frontal impact the new airbag system can significantly reduce the incidence of severe injuries and fatal outcome .    2.4152135695192216
the question of whether the airbag itself induces specific patterns of injury needs further investigation .    2.1092980993253385
two cases of traffic accidents with airbag protection are presented here .    2.322124636719108
the first case report clearly shows the life - saving and injury - reducing effect of the airbag system in a traffic accident with frontal impact at 100 km / h .    2.1588744303371787
in the second case only minor injuries of the face were diagnosed initially .    2.7255581731819496
hemodynamic instability occurred after 3 h of hospitalization due to rupture of the UNK vein .    3.124661497578677
analysis of the presented cases shows that , besides the well - known benefits , there are certain injury patterns that seem to be related to the use of UNK .    3.1990936321091232
these have not been described before .    3.0685430196580503
in our opinion it is not possible to estimate the severity of airbag - associated injuries with conventional methods .    2.8107562003989632
a questionnaire with 78 questions concerning the situation of ankylosing spondylitis ( as ) sufferers in germany was distributed to a representative 3000 out of the more than 14000 patient members of the german as society ; UNK patients ( 54 % ) responded .    2.3519730935072722
the age distribution of these patients roughly UNK with that expected due to the distribution of the age at diagnosis and the age distribution of the german population .    3.4060669422575005
the group of patients more than 65 years old is , however , under - represented .    2.9976198466608674
introduction : headache is thought to be generated by nociceptive processes within the UNK , followed by activation of trigeminal neurons within the brainstem .    2.5708778918146455
the noxious stimuli initially involved in these nociceptive processes are unknown .    2.1695299674012993
a preparation was developed in the barbiturate - anesthetized rat , in which the activation of trigeminal brain stem neurons by selective local stimulation of the dura mater could be observed .    2.355331233692223
atherosclerosis is a complex multifactorial disease of the arterial wall , dependent on genetic disposition and multiple other risk factors .    2.5506149952412294
there are probably several candidate genes , that determine the individual susceptibility of the vessel wall to develop atherosclerosis .    2.2614649780972913
in recent years , a growing number of gene polymorphisms , associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction , has been identified .    3.049878385227671
these genes and gene clusters play a crucial role in lipid metabolism , regulation of blood pressure and clotting .    2.299638498577497
in contrast to rare UNK diseases with severe clinical signs and symptoms ( e . g .    2.253004124751004
familial hypercholesterolemia ) , genetic polymorphisms are relatively frequent .    2.3229076225363805
due to their frequency , there is a high probability that one individual carries several alleles predisposing to coronary heart disease .    2.4708415189765875
genetic polymorphisms become clinically important by interacting with lifestyle , environmental factors or endogenous metabolic disorders .    2.0233299282586725
the fractures were fixed with small fragment implants through a modified extensile iliofemoral approach ( maryland approach ) .    1.9982509529382995
thirty - seven patients were polytraumatized with an iss of 20 pts .    2.3385190685061135
in 10 patients the iss was > 25 pts .    2.327634728677007
good or anatomic initial fracture reduction with a fragment UNK k 2 mm could be achieved in 48 UNK ( 96 % ) .    2.107528890565731
thirty - six patients with 37 fractures could be evaluated after 25 months on average .    2.2481131052058756
in 28 fractures ( 76 % ) the functional outcome was good or excellent according to the d ' aubigne and harris scores .    2.644260436674148
radiological results were excellent in 21 fractures ( 57 % ) and satisfactory in 12 fractures ( UNK score ) .    2.7081923216723354
in 7 cases ( 14 % ) a postoperative subcutaneous seroma had to be treated surgically .    2.7245698173951505
no wound infections , however , were observed .    3.5029928827602497
further complications were secondary a loss of reduction in 4 cases ( 11 % ) , relevant heterotopic ossifications ( brooker iii / iv ) in 5 cases ( 14 % ) , and aseptic femoral head necrosis in 2 cases ( 5 % ) .    2.7808364951883933
in two cases a total hip replacement ( thr ) for posttraumatic arthritis had to be performed .    2.528890185715223
two more cases are scheduled for thr due to symptomatic femoral head necrosis .    2.1454902482494767
a good joint reconstruction can be achieved through the modified extensile iliofemoral approach ( maryland ) in complex fractures of the acetabulum .    2.4381286181672466
however , the approach related morbidity seems to be UNK .    2.88052520466416
in complex fractures with comminution in the roof of the acetabulum the prognosis remains uncertain even in cases where initial anatomic joint reconstruction can be achieved .    2.2382940029391354
the discussion on the results of open spinal surgery , in particular , on complications as a result of open surgery , e . g . , the so - called post - UNK syndrome , has led to the development of less invasive methods , especially for treatment of lumbar disc UNK .    3.2663400077138864
percutaneous nucleotomy procedures are based on a variety of intradiscal diagnostic and therapy methods , such as UNK , retroperitoneal spinal disc UNK or UNK .    3.191939951681745
since the 1970 s , various methods such as mechanical percutaneous nucleotomy , automated percutaneous nucleotomy , intradiscal laser procedures and , in part , endoscopic intradiscal procedures have been developed and also used clinically .    2.2161000146890903
the clinical results vary from 30 % good / very good results to almost 100 % good / very good results , depending on the author and study .    2.311940098985329
it is obvious that not many prospective randomized studies using either conservatively or surgically treated control groups have been conducted .    2.0973957501730895
the results of these studies on intradiscal therapy methods are often analyzed more critically and with lower success rates than the partially retrospective studies of a single method , which often have large case numbers , but do not always meet the demanding criteria for scientific study design .    1.9840712463071963
to UNK good results , percutaneous nucleotomy procedures can only be used to treat select cases of lumbar disc disorders according to strict indication criteria .    2.608272484017292
at the present time it can be concluded that , in comparison to endoscopic und microsurgical methods , percutaneous nucleotomy procedures must be restricted to a small number of cases .    2.576577314782576
a 58 year old patient with hepatitis virus c ( hcv ) infection had a secondary polyclonal igg - igm cryoglobulinemia with a benign 20 year course .    2.0984570163256313
UNK the patient suffered from progressive pigmented purpura ( ppp ) .    2.453500557699716
histologic evaluation revealed a lymphocytic vasculitis .    2.523652479676812
food containing UNK UNK - UNK UNK of the ppp , as demonstrated with controlled oral provocation testing .    3.149452971950809
in most of the previously described cases of hcv and type iii cryoglobulinemia , the typical UNK finding was palpable purpura with leukocytoclastic vasculitis .    2.148534501701083
normal aging is associated with changes in body composition , UNK perception , renal function , and the hormonal regulatory systems involved in the maintenance of water and sodium balance .    2.7757408833852395
the presence of many diseases and drugs common in the elderly can interact with the impaired UNK systems to result in clinically significant disturbances of water and sodium with accompanying symptoms , morbidity , and mortality .    2.1526532751616325
these disorders , which include dehydration , UNK , UNK , urinary frequency , and urinary incontinence can either be prevented or promptly recognized and appropriately treated by understanding the physiological changes and clinical circumstances which put the elderly person at increased risk for UNK water and sodium balance .    2.297148596503143
although valvular stenosis may be evaluated adequately by measuring UNK pressure UNK with doppler echocardiography and cardiac catheterization , these methods have failed to provide reliable and accurate quantification of valvular regurgitation .    2.0626997075591107
in recent years the development of magnetic resonance imaging has broadened the diagnostic spectrum in cardiology , since it allows assessment of ventricular volumes without geometrical assumptions and the non - invasive quantification of blood flow within the heart and great vessels .    2.5457091518484405
the purpose of this overview is to evaluate " established " diagnostic tools and to show the capabilities of magnetic resonance imaging in the assessment of valvular heart disease .    2.4861294338359494
solvent induced polyneuropathy and encephalopathy have been acknowledged quite recently as occupational diseases in germany .    2.0959388291036203
for compensation first of all the diagnosis has to be proven .    3.1551592730983606
for differential diagnosis other known causes as well as non - organic mental diseases must be taken into consideration .    2.6230671720613437
the UNK between proven exposures and diagnosed disease has at least to be probable .    2.0913464184289263
to evaluate causation extensive experience of the experts is needed .    2.4497553344971856
in this context scientific criteria regarding UNK of the solvent , duration of exposure , individual aspects of non - occupational influences , time course of the disease are important within a thorough synoptic evaluation .    2.535257792522423
possibilities and limitations of sensitive diagnostic measures such as UNK , neuropsychologic and neuroimaging examinations are discussed .    2.5021310863488
the prognosis of toxic polyneuropathy and encephalopathy is in general favorable if exposure has stopped .    2.138554085911511
additionally , adequate therapy and rehabilitation measures are supportive for a good prognosis .    2.2891007367160285
standard radiography of the cervical spine is still the first imaging procedure applied in degenerative disease of the cervical spine .    2.6883167680801114
UNK UNK , osteochondrosis and UNK arthrosis are well depicted by such images .    2.448296884535671
whether or not additional imaging is needed depends on the clinical symptoms .    3.1391843660609418
special projections ( anteroposterior oblique radiographs , lateral radiographs in flexion and extension ) may be the next step .    2.3761589182851486
for many abnormalities , mainly of the intervertebral discs and the myelon , mr imaging has become the standard procedure , largely because of its multiplanar capabilities and its excellent contrast resolution .    2.250417202039239
ct can be used instead of mr imaging if the latter method is not available , and its strength lies in the depiction of bone abnormalities .    2.704299741755689
scintigraphy is suitable for early detection of abnormalities with unclear clinical symptoms and may then indicate the correct level of the cervical spine for mr imaging or ct . UNK and myelo - ct can no longer be considered routine imaging methods .    2.3532550870967612
a number of imaging abnormalities are not strictly related to clinical findings and should therefore always be discussed in the clinical context .    2.835309652956262
true derotation of the UNK - even in the thoracic spine - is achieved .    3.545963463244126
in cases of total canalicular occlusion or the total absence of the lacrimal apparatus the functional restoration requires the repair of a newly created lacrimal system .    2.2724538278129685
the intraoperatively UNK lacrimal drainage from the conjunctival sac will be maintained by a plastic tube .    2.128389363779813
beside other criteria the influence of the used inserted materials polyethylene or silicone should be evaluated .    2.452941368900349
a prospective , randomized and controlled trial is conducted to compare carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting in high grade symptomatic carotid artery stenoses .    1.9668597108766652
magnetic resonance imaging is used routinely with much success for various problems in different medical disciplines .    2.1960389732064023
however , the patient is exposed to static as well as to time - dependent magnetic fields and radio - frequency electromagnetic fields .    2.8308544114745056
in 1997 the UNK , the german radiological protection commission , passed a recommendation on the use of magnetic resonance in medical diagnostics .    2.9209813742447657
in this recommendation basic values related to thresholds for physiological effects and limits for restricted and unrestricted use are given .    1.8704980955446273
in the following the aim and applicability of this recommendation are discussed , as well as the thresholds and different limits for the static magnetic fields , the gradient fields and the radio - frequency fields .    2.2055838555909353
additionally , advice is given for the protection of high - risk patients , personnel , and the general public , together with further safety advice as well as recommendations for users and manufacturers .    2.858485413557485
six patients with granuloma faciale , including patients with multiple lesions , were treated successfully with cryosurgery .    2.6194269807253225
granuloma faciale is known to be difficult to treat .    3.36980605137877
cryosurgery is an effective and minimally invasive therapy for this granulomatous inflammation of the skin .    2.858904526202938
it should be considered as an alternative to dapsone .    3.8818844219279702
the results of early conversion of war fractures by the application of ao osteosynthesis in a group ( n = 32 ) of the injuried , were compared with b group ( n = 187 ) of injuried , treated definitely with external fixator .    2.5822387035904804
statistically less significant appearance of complications in a group during 2th and 6th month ( p < 0 . 001 ) was observed .    2.3167074804613192
in 12th month of observation , these differences statistically disappeared .    2.2065965597509765
healing observed by x - ray in 2th , 6th and 12th month of observation were no statistically significant differences between the two observed groups .    2.379439356194207
in 12 patients ( 40 % ) concomitant lesions of the intrinsic scapholunate ligaments were diagnosed .    2.8931186114033762
according to UNK we found grade i - tear in one patient , grade ii in three , grade iii in six and grade iv in two patients .    2.414009023529855
the eight individuals with grade iii - and iv - lesions additionally revealed marked UNK intraoperatively .    2.1605087725874665
therefore , operative stabilization was subsequently performed by temporary scapholunate and UNK arthrodesis .    2.1662858360287607
seven patients out of this group ( 87 . 5 % ) were followed up clinically and radiologically 3 years postoperatively , on average .    2.913035693315229
clinical examination included range of motion tests and a subjective questionnaire concerning pain and working ability .    2.2395704496816893
objective grip strength was measured using a jamar tester and compared to the contralateral wrist .    2.8120992228237487
radiological evaluation consisted of the UNK and lateral view as well as stress views in radial and ulnar deviation .    2.93693000752008
data were evaluated by the jakim and cooney scoring system as well as the demerit point system by gartland and werley as modified by sarmiento et al .    2.046332086892476
according to gartland , 100 % of our patients showed an excellent result ; these rates were 86 % using the jakim score and 60 % using the cooney scoring system .    2.2231375608827166
according to the subjective questionnaire all of the patients revealed an excellent or good result .    3.0864149979500413
open treatment of shoulder instabilities is well accepted and still golden standard .    2.3919777488603335
but arthroscopic techniques show also good and comparable results .    2.352601521430015
arthroscopic procedures however are not accepted for treatment of failures and revision cases .    2.4080032470093466
therefore we questioned whether a arthroscopic revision procedure is an option after failed first time open or arthroscopic stabilization .    2.0694021165599654
this prospective study was designed to assess the outcome of arthroscopic revision procedures after failed shoulder stabilization .    2.8440984195015235
in 1991 the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest with doppler sonography was accepted by the medical council of the UNK as one of the methods able to shorten the waiting time for fulfilling the criteria for diagnosis of cerebral death .    2.826468946059516
a survey was undertaken to determine how frequently doppler sonography has been used since that time in UNK brain death .    2.322410790868321
a total of 400 questionnaires were sent out to all neurological ( UNK ) and neurosurgical ( 128 ) departments in germany .    2.4034390283476914
in all , 226 questionnaires were returned .    2.352906613449092
in 71 departments , doppler sonography has been used to UNK brain death , mostly combined with other methods .    2.7211490248724264
the question of whether false positive results have been observed was answered five times in the UNK .    2.5753525069889713
the background to these cases was clarified by telephone calls .    2.3801282529294974
in order to indicate pitfalls , the examiners reported borderline situations which in part did not fulfil the prerequisites .    2.017753478100387
in none of these cases had the diagnosis of brain death been based on ultrasound data .    3.1724765866955758
doppler sonography for the diagnosis of cerebral circulatory arrest has been used by a considerable number of neurological and neurosurgical departments in germany as an additional UNK test and rather seldom as the only method to shorten the waiting period .    2.5463605459860887
we report on a 64 - year - old man who died within 1 h after admission to hospital with symptoms of respiratory insufficiency .    2.3815345646794146
autopsy showed as cause of death a clinically unknown coagulase - negative staphylococci - induced left - sided endocarditis with perforation of the aortic and mitral valve .    2.34536559061913
infective endocarditis by coagulase - negative staphylococci in native valves is a rare event .    2.396721286439042
the macroscopic appearance and histological findings are presented and discussed .    2.66160258802752
UNK are suitable for low - pain outpatient surgery of otitis media with effusion ( UNK ) under topical anesthesia .    2.6638930658649724
the myringotomy perforations should have a diameter greater than 2 mm to ventilate the middle ear for approximately 3 weeks .    2.299640335253249
comparison by skin epiluminescent microscopy of 60 malignant melanomas and 130 junctional and compound UNK naevi revealed statistically significant differences for 12 characteristics .    1.9365244157779653
the following microscopical in vivo signs that can be defined by histopathological examination were found only in malignant or premalignant melanocytic lesions : UNK radial UNK , greyish - blue reticular patterns , opaque UNK UNK UNK , brown / black UNK on a blue / greyish background , UNK at the periphery and blue - in - pink areas .    2.1147414691882362
nevertheless , specific epiluminescent phenomena of histopathologically defined malignant melanomas are still unknown .    2.0196317267629644
the present study examines the relationship between different psychological variables ( including anxiety , depression , locus of control , expectations of pain intensity and social support ) and postoperative pain , analgesic consumption and satisfaction with the pain management in a study sample of 67 patients .    2.19724996788586
clinical experience of 11 patients with charge association is reviewed .    2.494081239015425
the study comprised six girls and five boys .    2.319043541871371
all presented with congenital heart disease .    2.7573113715868582
eight had bilateral choanal atresia .    2.6483298479832094
UNK affecting either one or both eyes was detected in nine children .    2.4156895818590436
nine patients suffered abnormal UNK or deafness .    2.4856139072319774
in addition to major abnormalities , further anomalies of the orofacial region and the upper airways occurred in all patients .    2.40706386816813
three patients had cleft lip and palate .    2.548813504549592
both UNK and high - UNK palate were present in two patients .    3.2684857052747422
optimal management requires a multidisciplinary approach with active coordination and cooperation between the appropriate UNK .    2.3995384967136566
the anatomical repair of bilateral choanal atresia should be performed as early as possible .    2.4975319374510243
it gives the surgeon the opportunity of direct access and anatomical repair .    2.2861444083143176
after the child has grown stronger , a long - term management is desirable including developmental and feeding training .    2.3442867169827526
UNK are especially those situations , when people have to make ethical decisions .    2.1936310284379106
issues of medical ethics UNK up not only in hospital series , but often in UNK where this subject is hardly to be supposed : UNK , UNK , love stories and UNK UNK .    2.397097445924772
UNK these conflicts means offering a solution , and in doing so films refer to moral values and - at the same time - function as UNK for the social relevance of UNK topics .    2.280192915683048
but it is possible that ethical principles of good decision - making fall victims to the UNK of the UNK .    3.0492709947271495
analysis of the UNK conflict is similar to a case discussion in UNK and represents a helpful adjunct to the UNK of analytical and communicative UNK .    3.1009079328323113
several experimental studies and randomized clinical trials demonstrate a decrease of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment time of fractionated radiotherapy .    2.2335135690169308
proliferation or clonogenic tumor cells most likely is the major mechanism underlying this phenomenon .    2.31297008697215
important progress in radiation oncology might therefore be expected from inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic cells during radiation treatment .    2.100782720662386
possibilities to minimize the time factor are briefly discussed .    2.6668599610928916
inhibition of proliferation of clonogenic tumor cells during irradiation by simultaneous chemotherapy , by inhibition of signal transduction pathways that stimulate proliferation , or by pharmacological inhibition of angiogenesis are scientifically interesting but currently not proven to be effective to counteract the loss of local tumor control with increasing overall treatment of fractionated irradiation .    2.0020752755213667
at present , the only established approach is to complete radiotherapy within a short overall treatment time , e . g . by accelerated fractionation and by prevention or compensation of unscheduled treatment gaps .    2.098389624778407
technical innovations and software improvements in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and high - resolution sonography ( us ) have definitely influenced the diagnostic imaging of rheumatic diseases .    2.314770414853307
for mri , improvements in surface coils , dedicated low - field systems ( 0 . 2 t ) , and software improvements ( shorter acquisition times and refinements of fat suppressing techniques ) must be mentioned .    2.36496739630641
for sonography , the main innovations concern the development of higher transducer frequencies ( 7 - 15 mhz ) and power doppler imaging .    2.408478071454069
clinical evaluations have shown that mri and us are most useful in cases of suspected rheumatic disease with negative plain film radiographs and for documenting the course of the disease , diagnosing of early rheumatoid arthritis , making a differential diagnosis in clinically unclear rheumatic diseases , investigating vascularization , and quantifying pannus formation .    2.2948901126134915
in order to improve diagnostic efficacy the role of mri and us in the management of patients with rheumatic disease should be UNK .    3.0536550082601175
in addition to renal elimination and gastrointestinal metabolism ( UNK ; splenic and hepatic UNK ) colloid plasma solutions like dextran and hydroxyethyl starch deposit in tissues , especially in the UNK system ( res ) .    2.2297645762467657
we report here a case study of a patient with sepsis ( lung , liver and kidney failure ) who had an overload of the res with UNK while being treated with dextran ( molecular weight UNK and UNK daltons ) and hydroxyethyl starch ( mw UNK daltons , molar substitution 0 , 7 ) .    2.0846510352961887
in the late seventies and early UNK the toxic shock syndrome ( tss ) became epidemic among young UNK women .    2.0802215614205317
a strong correlation was found between tss and the rising popularity of UNK UNK .    2.508947914175106
exotoxin - producing staphylococcus aureus is seen as the main mediator of tss in controlled clinical trials .    2.394008413193244
menstrual and nonmenstrual forms of tss are differentiated .    2.417764019900861
the nonmenstrual form is comparatively rare and has a high rate of mortality rate .    2.841521408373202
several studies showed that the overall incidence of menstrual and nonmenstrual tss is approximately 1 - 3 cases per 100 000 persons .    2.4733095509084038
the leading symptoms are fever , hypotension , mucous membrane hyperemia , diffuse rashes , UNK , vomiting and diarrhea .    2.4962255331157635
the severe form of the syndrome leads to multiorgan dysfunction .    2.596551892607251
the streptococcal tss ( UNK ) caused by group a streptococci is clinically similar to the staphylococcal tss .    2.6085237185923047
both staphylococcus aureus and streptococci produce the exotoxin tsst - 1 .    2.2920921816568844
new methods allow the detection of tsst - 1 production .    2.750511966539197
however , due to the low incidence of tss , this method of detection has not yet been taken up in the routine diagnostic procedures .    2.8572403422616395
this report focusses on the emergence and spread of s . aureus with special clinical and epidemiological significance .    2.1858572424488716
results from typing mrsa originating from different clinical sources in all germany reveal that there is a continuing interhospital dissemination of definite epidemic strains and also a spread of the UNK gene to clonal groups of s . aureus which have been until now sensitive .    2.242826795722907
these newly emerging mrsa are still sensitive to a number of other antibiotics .    2.601763224981919
this results in less broad resistance phenotypes of currently disseminated mrsa .    2.1008504611501397
worth mentioning with regard to diagnostics are also three clinical cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by s . aureus UNK UNK and not UNK .    2.641949015172802
background : for cataract surgery in this country retro - and peribulbar anesthesia is the standard method .    2.4252313134127874
it totally UNK eye movement as well as sensitivity to pain .    2.8843621428106285
especially peribulbar anesthesia is known as a procedure with minimal complications , but the potential risks can be severe .    2.6534485822154807
a modified anesthetic method is demonstrated for complicated cataract surgery .    2.302237242651149
in patients with coronary artery disease , it is controversial whether cardiac arrhythmias result from acute subendocardial ischemia .    2.6324756315464835
the aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between myocardial ischemia and ventricular arrhythmia .    2.421346672329963
the UNK of cardiac rhythm and conduction disorders has been underestimated .    2.5198403067284083
therefore , the aim of this review is to analyze the current data and controversial issues in this area .    2.7118273964820268
we report the case of an 8 year old boy with a rare congenital myopathy ( with cytoplasmic inclusions bodies ) and clinical signs of rigid - spine - syndrome .    2.2201433579189165
during treatment of lung tuberculosis disordered breathing with hypoventilation during rem - sleep , hypoxemia and persistent hypercapnia during daytime were found .    1.9953732781397733
this complication in myopathies is caused by weakness of respiratory muscles and leads to negative features ( like pulmonary hypertension , daytime - sleepiness , growth failure or further UNK of the muscle disease ) .    2.3701319021593457
diagnostic steps in disorders of breathing during sleep in children with neuromuscular disease are shown .    2.4630271084275237
aortic dissection with no entry or false lumen flow was recently identified as intramural hemorrhage of the aortic wall ( imh ) .    2.1187684216753753
analysis of the literature revealed UNK cases of in vivo diagnosed imh reflecting 17 % of all dissections , whereas in UNK studies this condition is found in 4 - 13 % .    2.9042483220848125
transesophageal echocardiography , computed tomography , magnetic resonance imaging and aortography ( to rule out dissection ) have been applied for diagnosing imh in 57 , 49 , 43 and 38 % of the cases , respectively .    2.439720635252466
however , diagnostic accuracy of each modality is not available to date .    2.470830701518904
in 34 % , imh involves the ascending aorta ( type a ) .    2.566746151218195
the average age of patients with imh ranges between 55 and 65 years ; 65 % are males .    2.6159010809861147
in 12 % , imh was associated with abdominal aortic aneurysm .    2.9616221644090537
with 87 % , arterial hypertension is the predominant risk factor for imh irrespective of its location .    2.4959716672802954
as suggested by the term " mediastinal apoplexy " imh may - similar to cerebral apoplexy - result from hypertensive rupture of the vasa vasorum in the aortic media .    2.103811092929494
with 97 % , the majority of patients present with acute chest or back pain similar to classic dissection .    2.6836767698686024
mediastinal widening is found in 83 % ; signs of hemothorax / pleural effusion are present in 38 % , acute aortic regurgitation in 26 % , pericardial effusion in 23 % , acute neurologic deficits in 12 % , and pulse deficits in 5 % .    2.3329474594110016
in 18 % , imh progresses to dissection and in another 15 % to rupture .    2.4696695206041572
in 25 % and 28 % , respectively , dissection and rupture occur in the ascending aorta and in 12 % and 9 % , respectively , in the descending thoracic aorta .    3.1526759144734804
the 30 - day mortality of imh is 24 % ( 36 % with type a and 12 % with type b imh ; p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.345321232171591
with surgical repair , mortality of type a imh is lowered to 18 % compared to 60 % with medical treatment ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.4866956349205678
in contrast , with 8 % mortality associated with medical treatment , prognosis of type b imh is more favorable without surgical intervention , the latter associated with a 30 - day mortality of 33 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.3625886187526595
thus , imh is a potential precursor of dissection and should be managed like dissection with undelayed surgical intervention in patients with type a imh and with medical treatment in type b imh .    2.7003349217979697
we report on 3 exemplary case studies of patients with myelomeningocele who are under regular care in our outpatient clinic , and discuss the clinical and diagnostic problems and the therapeutic concept of fractures in patients with myelomeningocele .    2.8239170882448588
our case reports are in accordance to previous publications ; they show that signs of confined and systemic infection and variable x - ray signs with often extensive reactive formation of callus make the diagnosis of fractures in myelomeningocele patients difficult .    2.106613486620208
fractures often occur without pain or trauma .    2.418598434698783
background : since the end of the UNK , accidents have been identified as the most common cause of mortality in children and account for considerable childhood morbidity in industrialized western countries .    3.0321128378811624
in contrast to traffic - related accidents in older children and adolescents , which were consequently registered and documented , no epidemiological data exist about home injuries and accidents during the first years of life in germany .    2.279463513816448
this report presents data on accident - related UNK in a cohort of UNK infants , who participated in a prospective vaccine efficacy trial in germany from 1991 to 1994 .    2.4649983162415676
one - hundred - thirty patients underwent 53 electrophysiological studies including programmed atrial and ventricular stimulation and 96 atrial overdrive UNK on an outpatient basis .    1.9939638154930628
the indications for electrophysiological study were disabling UNK , syncope , or UNK , intracardiac conduction disturbance , and UNK .    2.5085978513488447
in one patient the efficacy of oral antiarrhythmic drug therapy was evaluated by repeat electrophysiological study .    2.658851927345865
atrial overdrive stimulation was performed in patients with atrial flutter or atrial tachycardia .    3.4254929874669053
except for one patient in whom atrial flutter could not be terminated , atrial fibrillation was induced in the remaining 30 patients .    2.8601839877730297
after the procedure , patients were monitored for 30 min in case of overdrive stimulation , and for approximately 3 h after electrophysiological study or 6 h if additional coronary angiography had been performed .    2.5242100509740353
severe complications were not observed .    2.726897908731471
in 10 cases minor hematoma occurred at the puncture site without serious sequelae .    2.159992359748267
- outpatients electrophysiological study as well as atrial overdrive stimulation are feasible and safe in a selected group of patients .    2.6546882571942048
endosteal implants after tumor surgery of the face are helpful in reconstructing facial defects .    2.6734671368867837
a retrospective study of our patients treated using craniofacial implants was conducted to evaluate long - term results .    2.781873260837461
a total of 128 implants were inserted , 110 implants in the periorbital , 12 implants in the mastoid , and six implants in the paranasal region ; 113 implants were short craniofacial brånemark implants , and 15 implants were dental implants .    1.9871985871055469
the success rate for implant survival was 94 . 5 % .    2.735348863275075
long - term results were promising and more than satisfactory , leading to a large indication for these endosteal implants .    2.5031161197707545
the term " ecstasy " includes a group of different UNK which produce hallucinogenic activity , stimulation and the so - called ' entactogenic ' effects .    2.4188391043767328
- " UNK " is usually translated as " producing a UNK within " or " creating an internal contact " and refers to the special UNK effect of this substances .    2.346595719148428
UNK have been reported to make users aware of previously unconscious feelings and experiences .    2.543526150051534
the " entactogenic " effect is the most typical of the UNK effects n 3 , 4 - UNK ( mdma ) .    3.204825458803758
mdma induces euphoria and acts stimulating , but the most common effect of mdma is a heightened sense of " UNK " with other people .    2.5551424362115416
the negative effects , especially depression and a general sense of anxiety , may UNK after the acute phase of ecstasy .    2.449452086928115
ecstasy is not a novel substance .    3.211071274256779
cisatracurium - one of the ten UNK of atracurium - is an intermediate long - acting non - depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent .    2.416133100925716
cardiovascular reactions have been described after administration of cisatracurium or vecuronium in surgical patients .    2.7698510812441497
after approval by our institutional review board , 62 patients ( asa i - ii ) were randomly assigned to three groups to either receive 3xed95 or 5xed95 of cisatracurium or 3xed90 of vecuronium prior to intubation as a bolus .    1.7802926658029687
after oral premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam anaesthesia was induced with thiopental ( 4 - 12 mg / kg ) and maintained with o2 / n2o and isoflurane ( 1 . 5 % - 2 % ) .    2.3092534126202273
six minutes after administration of thiopental , patients received the muscle relaxant .    2.704142417356877
six minutes later 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated .    2.541795369794183
heart rate ( hr ) and blood pressure ( bp ) were monitored every minute .    2.1704489938784817
changes of heart rate or blood pressure > 20 % compared to baseline were defined as clinically significant .    2.6048586758761534
after application of the study drug , median values of blood pressure and heart rate were stable .    3.091717635621963
for each muscle relaxant , there were several patients who had statistically significant cardiovascular changes .    2.6836425659710206
after 3xed95 cisatracurium , 3 of 21 patients exhibited haemodynamic changes > 20 % ( 2 exhibited hypotension and 1 tachycardia ) , while in the high - dose cisatracurium group 2 of 21 patients demonstrated a tachycardia that was UNK to be statistically but not clinically significant .    2.443337778758031
in the vecuronium group , 2 of 20 patients sustained statistically significant hypotension and 1 patient had statistically significant tachycardia .    2.410135480058575
the frequency of all individual cardiovascular changes after the application of the muscle relaxant was not dose - dependent .    2.6912124618132163
after the administration of cisatracurium in two different doses ( 3xed95 and 5xed95 ) or vecuronium ( 3xed90 ) only minor cardiovascular changes were observed .    2.165281389847996
both drugs proved to be safe for use during induction of anaesthesia in patients asa i - ii .    2.546222386326005
with regard to its cardiovascular effects , cisatracurium UNK with vecuronium the requirements of an ideal muscle relaxant .    2.3362987743137413
between june 1993 and september 1995 , 18 distal femoral fractures were treated using the supracondylar intramedullary nail .    2.180541108043269
there were 8 type a fractures and 10 type c fractures ( ao classification ) .    2.2697216604603287
the operative technique involved retrograde insertion of an unreamed supracondylar nail through the intercondylar notch .    2.1134078073119027
follow - up was available on all patients and averaged 18 . 3 months ( range 6 - 32 months ) .    3.0137860736929816
all fractures healed with an average time to union of 12 . 4 weeks ( range 8 - 16 weeks ) .    2.8336716228440917
bone grafting was not necessary in any case .    2.8731013792174855
sixteen patients achieved almost the same rom as they had had before the injury .    2.2727390772909315
one patient developed a varus UNK and underwent correction with a supracondylar osteotomy 20 months post trauma .    2.0829436940288324
there were no infections or nonunions .    2.409694398405474
the retrograde supracondylar nail is an excellent alternative to plate osteosynthesis in the management of UNK - and supracondylar femoral fractures .    2.938132495598384
autolyzed , antigen - extracted , allogenic ( aaa ) bone is an osteoinductive preparation of completely demineralized bone matrix .    1.9056766919315467
it has been clinically applied for years .    2.462899225869515
in an experimental study in rabbits , we evaluated the influence of cortical bone and periosteum on the amount of bone formation following augmentation with aaa bone .    2.685302464865301
two implants of standardized size were placed on the femoral bone of rabbits .    2.467160066285519
a cell - excluding ptfe membrane was wrapped UNK around the femur as well as the anterior implant shielding the implant from the surrounding periosteum .    2.3312440991823284
the posterior implant was exposed directly to the periosteum while being shielded from the cortical bone by the membrane .    2.1194624433670097
thus , two compartments were created selectively , preventing contact between the periosteum or cortical bone and the implants .    2.16574553691322
for each compartment the area and volume of the induced new bone were evaluated by computerized radiograph analysis and quantitative ct ( UNK ) scans .    2.3884977829553513
implantation of aaa bone led to new bone formation in both compartments .    2.5887493730024893
contact of the periosteum and the implant led to an almost UNK increase in bone volume .    2.5264366425054305
although bone formation showed interindividual variations , the difference of both compartments was highly significant using the student ' s t - test for paired samples ( p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.0515937426775914
the data show that periosteum is the primary source of new bone formation in augmentations with osteoinductive materials as it is rich in inducible progenitor cells and is well vascularized .    2.123724297059735
in osseous augmentations with aaa bone , the periosteum should be preserved in order to achieve a close contact of the osteoinductive implant .    2.521915070864115
shielding from the periosteum , e . g . , by cell - excluding membranes , leads to significantly less bone formation following implantation of aaa bone and should therefore be avoided .    2.247353832861613
computed tomography is a significant source of medical radiation exposure for populations in europe .    2.320958839687974
reduced radiation exposure may be possible with modern ct scanners with an image quality that while less good than before remains acceptable for clinical purposes .    1.9478947479337685
the lung appears particularly well suited to investigation with low - dose ct owing to the high contrast between normal and diseased pulmonary parenchyma .    2.485031897587538
undernutrition , particularly protein undernutrition , contributes to the occurrence of osteoporotic fracture , by lowering bone mass and altering muscle strength .    2.3009189766581177
furthermore , the rate of medical complications after fracture can also be increased by nutritional deficiency .    2.8844969838848056
the igf - i system appears to be directly involved in the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to osteoporotic hip fracture in elderly and to its complications .    2.5118916323612415
in the presence of adequate calcium and vitamin d supplies , protein supplements increasing the UNK from low to normal , raises igf - i levels , improves the clinical outcome after hip fracture , and UNK the decrease in proximal femur bone mineral density in the year following the fracture .    2.282599465439376
this nutritional approach is associated with a significant reduction of the stay in rehabilitation hospital .    3.116843700106377
this underlines the importance of nutritional supports in preventing and healing osteoporotic fractures .    2.40000063991051
the article discusses changes in the context within which the social professions are exercised .    2.7334792823374774
the chances for a UNK of social work and indeed its very locations change in line with the transition to new steering elements in the social body and the new implementation of competitive elements in the UNK of public law .    2.59607346376185
with the economising of the social sphere social work is questioned under economic aspects .    2.168607692746736
simultaneously it gains normative significance .    2.5627945983972222
this is true with regard to standards for the quality of services and institutions , and further in the context of the discussion concerning the UNK of local social policy for the elderly .    2.799256046184514
precisely the economising of the social sphere raises the question whether the UNK may be UNK from their responsibility to form , preserve and support the obligations of social work with the elderly .    2.3648432488555824
a comparison was made of the staining intensities of selected immunohistochemical proliferating antigens ( p53 , pcna , ki67 ) , dna flow - cytometry and UNK of neoplastic cells from 120 cases of laryngeal cancers .    1.9959425394110977
clinically very advanced tumors were in the majority ( t3 , 43 % ; t4 , 18 % ) .    2.4043238167486636
a 5 - grade scale was adopted to evaluate the level of immunohistochemical staining of the carcinoma cell nuclei .    2.719246451169986
positive staining was obtained in 70 % for p53 , 57 % for ki67 and 80 % for pcna .    2.324068839568044
sixty - two percent of the cases were dna - diploid and 38 % dna - aneuploid .    2.772728817860821
the dna - diploid carcinomas were accompanied by enlargement of the cell nuclei , preservation of wide margins of nuclear UNK , UNK of the nuclear areas and increases in the number of nuclei .    3.0044841440762617
in the aneuploid - UNK cancers the nuclei had a substantial polymorphism , with large UNK nuclei showing significant variations in size and having a nuclear envelope .    1.8660748459777363
a frequent finding was UNK of chromatin .    2.6436057031805626
dense chromatin appeared in the form of small UNK spread over the whole area of these irregular nuclei .    2.389961673519607
enlargement and activation of nucleoli were found .    2.5603062178689115
the antipyretic analgesics still comprise the most widely used group of analgesic compounds .    2.2106860581747174
until twenty years ago , aspirin , UNK derivatives and acetaminophen had been used as standard remedies for intercurrent harmless pain conditions in connection with infections , trauma , small surgeries , but also for tension headache and other painful conditions .    2.127034103597547
during the last decades , this group has been supplemented by a variety of 2 - UNK acids being primarily developed for the treatment of rheumatic pain and inflammation .    2.8330763276185413
some of them ( e . g .    2.3513506110829905
ibuprofen , ketoprofen and naproxen ) have been given over - the - counter status in some countries because of their relative safety at low doses .    2.2463971980571666
nevertheless , pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among the various substances of this group make them suitable to a different degree for the treatment of pain conditions .    2.237703451078729
a 38 - year - old man presented with an intracranial extra - axial tumour at the base of the left posterior fossa which proved to be a meningeal melanocytoma .    2.53288621438052
meningeal melanocytoma is a rare , benign melanotic tumour of the UNK occuring predominantly in the posterior fossa or the upper spinal cord in adults .    2.8553218265637454
it usually lacks signs of malignancy such as high mitotic rate , necroses or infiltrative growth and shows a low labeling index in proliferation marker studies .    1.8568522738001407
its immunohistological profile with s - 100 protein - , vimentin - and hmb - 45 - positive tumour cells is similar to that of ( primary or metastatic ) malignant melanoma .    2.224232973061468
this differential diagnosis is crucial because of the totally different therapeutic and prognostic implications .    2.891690458264527
therefore , UNK dealing with surgical neuropathology should be familiar with the rare , but clinically important diagnosis of meningeal melanocytoma .    2.216647319399836
a 54 - year old , obese woman suffered from massive symmetrical swelling of the face , especially of the upper and lower eyelids .    2.8828600284012698
initially the swelling occured intermittently , but after 2 years it was permanent and progressive markedly limiting her visual fields .    2.036253196566103
neither laboratory findings nor imaging procedures provided any firm evidence of an underlying cardiac , renal or endocrinological disease .    2.0157535839404064
there was no suggestion of a storage disease .    2.3163935519915855
skin biopsy showed foam cells and granulomatous inflammation , so the patient was tentatively diagnosed as having a UNK UNK - UNK syndrome .    2.9196484627367183
eyelid surgery was performed to improve her visual fields .    2.8091628108058084
treatment with clofazimine 100 mg daily was initiated .    2.3867465089918705
the patient died a sudden cardiac death a few months later .    2.749946690131234
the relatives refused an autopsy .    2.548888450909525
the definite cause of her facial swelling remains unclear as we discuss the differential diagnostic possibilities .    2.365902718008127
an 81 - year - old patient had prolonged competitive neuromuscular blockade with train - of - four ratios of 0 . 1 and 0 . 5 , respectively , after two successive anaesthesia procedures ( enflurane - n2o / o2 ; vecuronium - succinylcholine - sequence ) for transurethral prostate resection .    2.310785555166271
although antagonism with neostigmine was promptly successful after the first , 65 - min period of anaesthesia ( 1 . 5 mg vecuronium for precurarization , 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation , 3 mg vecuronium ) , repetitive and UNK staggered administration of neostigmine after the second , 30 - min period of anaesthesia ( 1 mg vecuronium for precurarization , 100 mg succinylcholine for intubation ) had hardly any effect , so that the patient had to be ventilated mechanically for a total of 4 . 5 h . laboratory analysis revealed homozygous , atypical , plasma cholinesterase ( UNK u / l ; UNK number 23 ; genotype e < ! [ cdata [ | lefbop | a < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | opnbop | 1 < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | e < ! [ cdata [ | lefbop | a < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | opnbop | 1 < ! [ cdata [ | clobop | ) .    1.7867250014873195
this retrospectively confirmed a succinylcholine - induced phase ii block in both instances , as had already been suspected following the second anaesthetic procedure .    1.9762289425810964
the degree of block transformation , and thus the available time , are decisive in explaining the diverse effects of antagonism here .    2.316054956339633
it must be assumed that a complete phase ii block developed after the first succinylcholine exposure owing to the longer duration of anaesthesia ; the purely competitive component ( train - of - four ratio 0 . 1 ) was easily antagonized by neostigmine .    2.3802371648067058
at the time of the attempted antagonism after the second , shorter period of anaesthesia , however , block transformation was still incomplete ( train - of - four ratio 0 . 5 ) .    2.6333941274975095
the administration of neostigmine therefore rather intensified the depolarization segment of the mixed block , so that repeated attempts at antagonism then inhibited any further block transformation .    2.100525181140666
the UNK - negative groups of chronic myeloproliferative diseases ( cmpd ) are described , and histopathological criteria that distinguish them from each other are given .    2.331103914467813
these are based upon observations in primary biopsies from 2 , 331 patients with cmpds among a total of 34 , 160 patients referred between 1 january 1989 and 30 june 1994 to the bone marrow registry .    2.320674558892996
these cases of cmpd break down into the main groups as follows : cml 23 . 2 % , megakaryocytic UNK consistent with UNK myeloid metaplasia 22 . 3 % , essential thrombocythemia 22 . 1 % , and polycythemia vera 20 . 4 % ; 12 . 0 % of cases were UNK .    2.6121996023682605
histological progress in each group is characterized by ( 1 ) increasing number and UNK of megakaryocytes , ( 2 ) increasing fibrosis , and ( 3 ) excess of UNK .    3.0523719177977013
these three features can be observed in diagnostic biopsies before any therapy .    2.6013405725373184
therefore , it is recommended that such alterations be reported semiquantitatively .    2.38713967768041
a staging system with four stages from 0 to 3 for each of the three features is introduced .    2.4866991381096284
its application allows staging for the individual patient on the basis of diagnostic UNK - UNK .    2.958295261215488
chondral and osteochondral lesions as well as bone UNK of the ankle are caused in the most cases by trauma and are localized almost exclusively at the talus .    2.9717316159706355
for diagnosis , operative management and follow up , magnetic resonance imaging was useful , which can be further improved by application of intravenous or UNK contrast enhancement ( gadolinium ) .    2.596273189324558
in adults operative therapy is favored .    2.5432577351716517
due to new techniques , arthroscopy became an important alternative to arthrotomy .    2.35491307815385
according to the stage of the disease , drilling or curettage , removal or fixation of the fragment , autologous bone transplantation or osteochondral graft can be performed .    2.559044763788204
all procedures can be managed arthroscopically .    3.0362464063706747
general psychotherapy UNK ' t a new type of therapy , but it could be a paradigmatic model for all empirically - oriented psychotherapists .    2.42090720578965
the contents of this model are defined .    2.6814494269502
arguments and reasons are put forward as to why the practice of psychotherapy should be guided by empirically based procedure rules instead of by therapy methods .    1.9149381357499549
a consistency - theory based model of psychological functioning is UNK , from which conclusions can be drawn about the emergence and maintenance of psychological disorders on the one hand and the prescription conditions of different therapeutic procedures on the other .    2.203349666329095
the advantages of this model in view of a general psychotherapy are discussed .    2.9458005734814283
in the federal republic of germany , no data existed regarding the frequency of open heart surgery for excision of cardiac neoplasms .    2.377724918683329
therefore , a standard questionnaire concerning heart tumors was sent to all 77 german heart centers performing cardiac surgery .    2.096291262108016
although induction chemotherapy administered prior to local therapy produces encouraging initial response rates in head and neck cancer , randomized studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in survival rates .    2.2188997400814574
all randomized studies included only patients with advanced stage iii and iv disease .    2.7801418010835803
in our opinion , this is the main reason for the low rate of complete responses demonstrated in the randomized trials ( maximum 18 % ) .    2.5288434292192
estimate that a 40 % - 50 % complete response rate is necessary before improved survival rates are seen .    2.289403602919741
to date , such complete response rates with induction chemotherapy have only been UNK in resectable t2 - t3 , n0 - n2 disease .    2.0154466628658176
therefore , we initiated a prospective randomized trial including only patients with the mentioned disease stages .    2.478324103466039
patients ( pts ) were randomized to receive either induction chemotherapy with three cycles of carboplatin / 5 - fu prior to surgery and radiotherapy ( arm a , 70 pts ) or standard treatment with surgery and radiotherapy ( arm b , 74 pts ) .    2.132395491888457
the observed remission rate after chemotherapy confirmed the primary estimated rate for this subgroup of patients with head and neck cancer ( cr : 43 % , pr : 37 % , UNK : 15 % , pd : 5 % ) .    2.311291543230181
after a follow - up of 12 - 96 months overall survival was 58 % in arm a and 45 % in arm b ( n . s . ) .    2.3867602752746344
disease - free survival in arm a ( 61 % ) is statistically significantly better than in arm b ( 43 % , p = 0 . 03 ) .    2.701524827811333
therefore , we recommend further controlled trials to investigate the role of induction chemotherapy in patients with primary resectable carcinomas of the oral cavity and UNK and stage t2 - t3 and n0 - n2 disease prior to surgery .    2.806739680853861
minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass surgery has evolved as a reliable method to perform left internal mammary artery ( UNK ) bypass surgery to the lad .    2.7082842222421273
this novel technique represents a synthesis of known approaches to coronary surgery using sternotomy without extracorporeal circulation and limited access techniques in general thoracic surgery .    1.9923938129182728
applying specially designed tools for both harvesting the internal mammary artery and mechanically stabilizing the anterior surface of the heart during anastomosis , this approach is gaining widespread acceptance .    2.2834651511075212
a steadily growing number of patients with proximal lad lesions are submitted to cardiac surgery and the procedure is performed with increasing success rates , now approaching 98 % short term patency .    2.4799315006610834
in a specific series war injuries in the trochanteric region were characterized ; a limited methodological approach magnified the problem .    2.104743065296065
our experience and the treatment results ( debridement , drainage and external fixation ) are presented .    2.655004294782184
the methodology , complications and final results are also given for 15 patients .    2.3881077897861953
consolidation was achieved in primary external fixation without additional procedures such as UNK or internal fixation conversion methods .    2.7656663575804488
the time to consolidation without complications was 28 . 6 weeks ( 24 - 36 ) and with complications ( deep infections , chronic osteomyelitis ) 40 . 8 weeks ( 28 - 68 ) .    2.282285124842947
in total , there was one poor result with angulation , shortening of the extremity and chronic intermittent UNK .    2.5414043140199687
the average follow - up was 22 . 7 months ( 1 - 34 months ) .    2.988746867586674
our personal experience and the results speak on behalf of external fixation .    2.8407215214935126
under war conditions , primary fixation ensures the best late anatomical and functional results .    2.11445236773401
minimal osteosynthesis improves the final outcome if the rules of application and the indications for selection are adhered to strictly .    2.2759396663292524
introduction of the computed tomography index ctdi and the multiple scan average dose ( msad ) has led to standardization of the dose description in ct examinations .    2.2408133766277776
despite the use of these dose parameters , many different dosages are reported in the literature for different ct methods .    2.7225175153836165
in addition , there is still a wide range of radiation dosimetry results reported for conventional ct , helical ct , and hrct used in chest examinations .    2.2938758599040763
the variations in dosage are mainly due to differences in factors affecting the dose , i . e . beam geometry , beam quality , scanner geometry ( " generation " ) , and operating parameters .    2.3298855912789116
in addition , ct dosimetry instrumentation and methodology make a contribution to dosages .    2.067445838927025
recent studies calculating differences in factors affecting dosage and ct dosimetry and using similar operating parameters , show similar results in ct dosimetry for conventional and helical ct . on the other hand , dosages for hrct were greatly reduced .    1.9114374784597472
this was mainly caused by narrow beam collimation and increasing section spacing .    2.2071434406136583
central pulmonary embolism represents one of the most threatening complications in surgical patients .    2.718479634149857
in most cases deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremities is the source of emboli .    2.950009489744996
despite the introduction of UNK drugs in standard surgical concepts the incidence of deep vein thrombosis remains about 10 % in trauma patients .    2.8851656423029857
estimated numbers of unknown cases of pulmonary embolism are supposed to be rather high too .    2.6374467685602307
in UNK symptomatic pulmonary embolism events and especially when the patient has to be reanimated , mortality rates of up to 93 % are reported in literature .    2.7925409198753175
after introduction of the heart - and lung - machine in the surgical concept of therapy , survival rates have increased significantly .    2.7502351714026103
we report on three cases of successful surgical embolectomy after cpr .    2.3099431633704843
in a review of literature current concepts of treatment in central pulmonary embolism are discussed .    2.8671726651406253
imaging of tumors of the pancreas may have a series of significant implications for surgical decision making .    2.832156711053795
first of all verification and localization of a suspected tumor is crucial .    2.454290746256758
later on , accurate staging of local tumor extent and of distant metastases is necessary for evaluating the indications for surgical intervention .    2.5415155366228754
if histologic proof of malignancy of a pancreatic lesion is needed , different imaging techniques can be used for percutaneous biopsy of the tumor .    2.457842018781399
finally imaging is required in patients with a pancreatic tumor if an obstruction of the common bile duct is treated with palliative intent by endoscopy or UNK intervention .    2.586757884480902
a rational and efficient selection from all the imaging techniques currently available requires a clear - cut definition of what is needed for surgical decision making in each individual case .    2.051892303404241
thereby one has to take into account whether the tumor arises from the exocrine or from the endocrine tissue of the pancreas .    2.5474985341545207
in spite of the importance of skin diseases in africa south of the UNK , dermatology is insufficiently represented within the established primary health care systems .    2.461287886560611
aim of this study was to find out whether an integrated dermatology project could reduce the prevalence of dermatoses .    2.521173426981946
magnetic resonance imaging has shown to be a sensitive method for diagnostics of the red bone marrow , the composition of which changes physiologically and during pathological processes .    2.4912199085907845
however , the interpretation of mri in patients with disorders of the red bone marrow is very difficult .    3.3751197356965634
the aim of this study was the characterization of the proton spectrum of healthy bone marrow and its age - and sex - dependent changes to obtain a data basis for measurements in patients .    2.0792884988156746
we report a case of a 26 - year - old patient , a UNK by profession , with a history of a fall from a height of 5 meters with blunt thoracic injury and resultant left atrial rupture .    2.545096003543
the emergency doctor found at the site of accident a deeply comatose patient ( glasgow coma scale 3 points ) with no UNK blood pressure .    2.1379690205219855
after two hours of resuscitation at the site of accident and at the closest emergency traumatology unit a marginal blood pressure was seen .    2.2923069115406802
with a suspicion of a closed ascending aortic rupture the patient was transferred to the UNK cardiothoracic surgical unit .    2.7915256337296217
during transfer , the patient had a cardiac standstill with asystole and was further reanimated and resuscitated .    2.449894338783028
on arrival the patient was transferred to the operation theatre immediately and after femoro - femoral cannulation was supported by a heart - lung - machine circulation .    2.2913026247158337
through an optimal exposition the internal thoracic organs were inspected in detail and the rupture of the left atrium was identified and treated .    2.460144831656589
the heart was effectively UNK and with deep hypothermia with a reduction of oxygen consumption by all organs especially the brain was taken care of .    2.2128522761528755
the patient could be discharged from hospital on the UNK postoperative day in absolute good health .    2.5707147319797925
since mitochondrial diseases lead frequently to severe phenotypes and are often hereditary , there is a need for genetic counselling of the affected families .    2.455305194279724
the specific features of mitochondrial genetics , however , hamper UNK definition of recurrence risks as in mendelian diseases .    2.346502152940798
empirical risks were recently provided for melas and UNK syndromes and for leber hereditary optic neuropathy .    2.1651495751918994
in melas and UNK , higher levels of mutant mtdna in the mothers ' blood were associated with an increased frequency of affected offspring .    2.5642251074483275
chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia and UNK - UNK syndrome are in general sporadic disorders without increased recurrence risks in the offspring .    2.496844784608325
as UNK syndrome is found with maternal , autosomal recessive or x chromosomal transmission , the definition of the molecular defect is crucial for genetic counselling .    2.3251611374400016
an accurate and complete depiction of the halo naevus has been left by UNK grünewald in his UNK " the UNK of st . UNK " , which is part of the UNK UNK piece ( UNK - UNK ) , which is now exhibited in UNK , UNK .    3.318212119939334
in contrast , sutton in UNK only described a " UNK UNK UNK " , leaving the nature of the central lesion in the dark .    2.9821650132678776
the term sutton naevus therefore appears less appropriate than the alternative UNK designation " grünewald naevus " .    1.9293134362187832
the most widely used staging system is based on the pathologic tnm classification .    2.717718258090514
in recent years conservative therapies such as preoperative chemo - or radiotherapy are used more often with limited tissue evaluation resulting in insufficient or even inaccurate staging data .    1.9006932291408767
tumor size as well as nodal involvement is decisive in selecting a treatment method and assessing the response .    2.5333033457799377
thus , more accurate preoperative in vivo staging is necessary .    2.287647682197863
this article therefore gives an overview of the different imaging modalities ( mammography , ultrasonography , magnetic resonance imaging , and nuclear medicine ) used for breast cancer staging .    2.3481248277388618
furthermore , results of these methods are compared critically with the pathohistologic staging .    2.56106979409943
the lack of muscle control in neurological disorders often leads to deformities of the foot .    2.483511470943618
the equinus ( a contracture of the triceps surae muscle ) , the abduction and clubfoot deformity are the most common ones .    2.5007653651276938
the present paper describes the deformities and stresses the functional relevance for the patient .    2.2775695318914204
therapeutic principles of the conservative orthopaedic means are described with special emphasis on the need of an adequate height of the UNK and the foot position .    3.10480141160914
casting and the application of UNK UNK are described having a major side effect of muscle UNK .    3.254919722629716
a combination of the different procedures , surgical interventions included , need to be selected for each patient offering the best management for each individual problem .    2.59219624285804
still ' s disease was originally described as one form of rheumatoid arthritis in children beginning with fever and other systemic symptoms .    2.553643181113447
in rare cases it may also begin in the adult and is then referred to as adult - onset still ' s disease .    2.292755159473956
the diagnostic criteria include typical rash , UNK , UNK of fever , and leukocytosis , as well as lymphadenopathy or splenomegaly , liver dysfunctions , non - infectious angina , and absence of rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibodies .    2.5718843806100136
we report two adult patients with longstanding disease whose exanthema guided us to the correct diagnosis .    2.1271729324500077
it is characterized by red macules with distinct borders and is UNK .    2.2869724649642675
during an acute flare of the rash , gentle friction induces erythematous , isomorphic ( koebner ) phenomena , which , as we describe here for the first time , may persist longer than the remainder of the UNK rash .    2.16218619351603
since calculated antibiotic treatment is often difficult , it was recommended to obtain routine nose / throat swabs in order to have a better idea of the causative agent when a systemic inflammatory response occurs in a given patient .    2.653248780511039
methods : in UNK patients of our cardio - surgical icu , routine nose / throat swabs were taken three times a week and tested for micro - organisms and resistance to antibiotics .    2.1639709293279665
of these 86 patients developed clinical signs of systemic inflammation , and additional blood cultures were obtained .    2.376461515886897
antibiotic treatment was achieved to cover the microbes from the nose / throat swabs , or a calculated dosage was given to patients whose swabs had tested negative .    2.1203920117151567
results : of the 86 patients with systemic inflammation , 29 had blood cultures positive for microbes .    2.2004296944808672
of these 29 patients , 18 received a calculated antibiotic coverage based on their positive nose / throat cultures prior to the return of the blood cultures from the lab .    2.296099318230561
however , in only 11 of the 18 patients were routine swabs and blood cultures positive with the same microbes .    2.3682861197682534
while positive routine swabs are quite specific for sepsis when there is a systemic inflammatory response , routine swabs are not a suitable screening tool due to their low sensitivity .    2.475292787974335
conclusions : routine nose / throat swabs led to earlier specific antibiotic treatment in only 22 % of our patients with clinical signs of systemic inflammation .    2.3614527068594695
in addition , in almost 40 % of the cases organisms detected in the routine swabs and blood cultures were not identical .    2.7022709062088297
as a result , we feel that routine swabs are only of limited value in instituting earlier , specific antibiotic treatment in septic patients .    2.046580324723295
the influence of defensivity , measured by validity scales of personality inventories ( mmpi - k , fpi - r , giessen - test ) on test results and psychotherapy outcome was studied in 309 patients treated with inpatient client - centered therapy .    1.9281296658104479
in general , psychotherapy patients exhibited low defensivity .    2.302236108594566
25 % of patients , who denied psychopathology at admission , did so at discharge and to some extent at follow - up , demonstrating an " especially good outcome " ( means ) .    2.347698166314661
relative improvement ( effect sizes ) , however , was significantly diminished in psychopathology scales and significantly enlarged in validity scales .    2.219664151457334
- results are discussed with regard to prior hypotheses about the influence of defensivity .    3.2556974817790505
in our study we tested 2 different rapid assays for cardiac troponin t ( tropt - rapid assay , diagnostic cut - off 0 , 2 ng / ml and UNK - rapid assay , diagnostic cut - off 0 , 1 ng / ml ) in 75 chest pain patients .    2.120038902257022
additional to the emergency ecg ( 3 - lead ) we acquired a 12 - lead ecg .    2.586689901251485
the tropt - rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 11 % ( specifity 94 , 3 % ) .    2.2531811294216433
the tropt sensitive - rapid assay showed a sensitivity of 62 % ( specifity 100 % ) .    2.204875865674594
despite the great number of publications during the last 10 years concerning the indication , technique and results of operative treatment of acetabular fractures , conservative treatment still has an important role when considering the therapeutic possibilities .    2.718937890274623
because of the modern techniques of radiological imaging and improvement of diagnostic facilities , a more defined indication for treatment becomes possible .    2.398246296473744
the most suitable treatment can then be adapted to the individual circumstances of the patient , i . e . , age , general condition and overall severity of traumatic impairment .    2.5546171417580474
determination of the intact part of the weight - bearing dome is important in selecting the most adequate therapeutic procedure .    2.686627467305339
the larger the intact roof arc , the better the prognosis .    2.24429510257159
together with the x - ray controls following axial and facultative lateral UNK , the indication for conservative treatment can be confirmed .    3.2291488868003744
early active motion of the injured limb , followed by walking exercises with partial weight - bearing , are important aspects of nonoperative treatment .    2.4931526876469783
conservative treatment is recommended in non - displaced fractures or in fractures with little displacement , transverse fractures of the lower region or severely comminuted acetabular fractures with no possibility of reconstruction .    2.477224540393718
our clinical and radiological follow - up of 97 patients with acetabular fractures from the years 1981 - 1990 showed that the majority were treated conservatively ( approx .    2.5970921648087657
the functional result after an average observation period of more than 70 months was good or excellent ( based on the merle d ' aubigné score ) .    2.6857450899578867
we feel it is important to look at operative and conservative treatment of acetabular fractures as two complementary non - competitive therapeutic methods .    2.311259496134307
the choice of treatment should be based on an exact diagnosis considering fracture type , the individual circumstances of the patient , and application of the necessary diagnostic facilities .    2.981423555824502
conservative treatment can lead to excellent long - term results .    3.072960413482681
problem there is a great need to expand current knowledge of the various functional capacity measurements used in the rehabilitation of chronic low back pain ( clbp ) patients .    2.834061523465178
the literature on these patients reports that mobility , endurance , trunk strength and lifting capacity decrease during the process of chronicity .    2.1731061625284975
chronically disabled patients appear to have lower functional capacity than asymptomatic persons .    2.250886413121038
methods our study group consisted of 90 disabled clbp patients ( 44 female , 46 male ; average age 42 years ) who underwent a multidisciplinary 8 - week daily treatment program of functional restoration with behavioral support ( instruction , endurance training , strength exercises , behavioral and treatment to facilitate return to work therapy ) .    1.8954338426601502
initially these patients where compared with 107 asymptomatic persons ( 44 female , 63 male , average age 41 years ) .    2.0666583244820784
the patients were investigated before and after treatment , and at intervals of 6 and 12 months .    3.333030129836352
the reliability of the functional measurements was evaluated by interrater comparison .    2.728958046366467
physical assessment included a medical examination ( mainly diagnosis of radicular or UNK pain ) , changes in the lumbar spine revealed by x - ray studies according to UNK and turner [ 50 ] , rating of physical impairment according to UNK [ 117 ] , flexibility , length of hamstrings muscles ( slr ) , test of power and endurance of trunk movement by standardized exercises according to the swiss group of spring [ 102 ] and isokinetic measurements ( lido back ) , tests of lifting capacity ( lido lift ) , and ( in part ) of general endurance on a cycle ergometer ( case 15 UNK ) .    2.068938072990202
results physical findings showed that mobility was reduced substantially in patients suffering from back pain due to reduced slr ( shortened hamstrings ) and decreased spinal mobility .    2.1944434941304825
patients also demonstrated significant reductions in their ability to perform lifting tasks in comparison to healthy individuals .    2.5341479062597267
the results of trunk flexion showed no significant differences between patients and the control group , whereas the ability to perform trunk extension was much better in the control group .    2.846371164763175
in principle we found the same results with isokinetic measurements as in the exercises without machines .    2.494529806763221
cardiovascular endurance was also much better in the control group than it was in the back pain patients .    2.481734679121703
at the end of the treatment program all physical deficits were improved significantly .    2.6038726609233227
in many cases performance was comparable with that of the control group .    2.7592319478558163
the success of treatment ( return to work , absence from work , pain reduction , use of medical care ) was independent of the functional status of the patients before and after treatment .    3.0329875055500293
conclusion study results showed that physical capacity in disabled patients with low back pain is substantially reduced in comparison to persons who do not suffer from back pain .    2.7596711676804646
the only exception was in trunk flexor strength and endurance , in which measurements did not differ between the patients and the control group .    2.6326047779101422
however , even clbp - patients with long - term pain and severe physical illness can successfully improve their physical condition by participating in an active treatment program .    2.1575345972202786
back extensor muscle training has to be included in physical therapy .    2.751390745842794
because of loss of condition during the time after treatment , regular monitoring of patients and their home training programs is necessary .    2.5597409685674046
overall , treatment of clbp has to include physical training and psychosocial treatment to achieve satisfactory results .    2.1767793007744567
the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain is very complex and is frequency - dependent .    2.429941901291319
to date , this has still not been fully investigated or understood .    2.384360280394484
there remains a lack of measurement procedures to pick up the motion of the ossicles and ear drum simultaneously with sufficient resolution .    2.3041044884914177
the presented paper reports simultanous measurements with laser - doppler UNK at two points of the ossicular chain of cadaver specimens .    2.1821370615783815
motions not observed were derived using mechanical simulation models on a computer and then evaluating appropriate mathematical UNK .    1.9637970024194544
using a sound stimulus , the displacement velocities of the umbo and stapes footplate were measured , and the corresponding transfer functions were derived by fourier transform .    2.092582910918819
results were used for verification of the computer models .    2.8876884218325944
in the current investigations these models were refined and allow for the detailed investigation of the dynamic behavior of the ossicular chain , facilitating the optimal design of passive and active middle - ear implants .    2.202241022495482
problem : postoperative nausea and vomiting remains an important problem .    2.61310566684999
many risk factors have been identified ; however , the importance of postoperative analgesic technique and patient expectation remain poorly defined .    2.8714671043941604
reactive oxygen species ( ros ) are probably not only unintended , toxic side - products of oxygen metabolism in mammalian cells , they also have several important physiologic functions including antimicrobial killing , regulation of cellular proliferation and growth , and regulation of vascular tone .    1.8479710676221999
ros are generated within the vessel wall by several mechanisms , including a vascular type of a UNK ( p ) h oxidase .    2.6728473838985227
ros formation can be stimulated by mechanical stress , environmental factors , the peptide angiotensin ii , cytokines , native low - density lipoproteins ( ldl ) , and in the presence of UNK metal ions .    2.540288314400406
their ability to UNK ldl , react with endothelial - derived nitric oxide subsequently forming UNK , and amplify the expression of various genes important for leukocyte recruitment within the arterial wall are the basis of the oxidant injury theory of atherosclerosis .    2.2644827349285177
in animal studies , antioxidant therapy ( UNK , UNK UNK , n ' , n ' - UNK , vitamin e , UNK UNK ) have been successfully used to prevent fatty UNK formation , and to restore impaired nitric oxide - dependent UNK .    3.033321939089264
in man , antioxidant therapy ( e . g . , supplementation with vitamin e ) clearly increased the resistance of ldl to oxidative modification .    2.122830063529476
case - controlled and prospective clinical studies suggest a relation between baseline antioxidant plasma levels and / or antioxidant supplementation and risk of cardiovascular events .    2.3218647305999407
in one secondary prevention trial ( randomized , blinded , placebo - controlled ) , vitamin e supplementation reduced significantly the risk for non - fatal myocardial infarctions .    2.2513924506731877
before general recommendations can be made , results of further large - scale trials should be UNK .    2.5328315264700727
a 36 - year old man suffered an isolated head injury with a fracture of the skull , epidural and subdural hematomas as well as brain contusion ( abbreviated injury scale ( ais ) : 5 points ) .    2.4578812203101164
the hematomas were UNK by craniotomy .    2.7638873876689076
because of high intracranial pressure ( icp ) a barbiturate coma was necessary .    2.2301333986654335
additionally , the patient demonstrated acute lung injury ( ards ) due to pneumonia 8 days after trauma .    2.7100831993238312
the patient recovered slowly and was transferred to UNK on day 57 after injury .    2.321076743422096
during the following 12 months the patient developed a significant deficit of hip motion ( extension / flexion : right : 0 ° / 10 ° / 20 ° , left : 0 ° / 10 ° / 30 ° ; external / internal rotation : right and left : < 5 ° / 0 ° / < 5 ° ; abduction / adduction : right : 10 ° / 0 ° / 25 ° , left : 10 ° / 0 ° / 10 ° ) .    2.0036508824868036
x - rays and ct - scanning revealed severe heterotopic ossification ( ho ) of both hips with UNK ( brooker type iv ) .    2.2032692741019018
resection of ho was carried out in a two stage procedure using smith - UNK approach .    2.442531679383571
the prophylaxis for recurrence of ho included preoperative single - dose radiation ( 8 gy ) and postoperative treatment with indomethacin ( 150 mg per day ) .    2.2072057047799656
the patient revealed 15 ( left hip ) and 12 ( right hip ) months after surgery the following range of hip movement : extension / flexion : right : 5 ° / 0 ° / 90 ° , left : 5 ° / 0 ° / 100 ° ; external / internal rotation : right : 20 ° / 0 ° / 30 ° , left : 20 ° / 0 ° / 20 ° ; abduction / adduction : right : 30 ° / 0 ° / 40 ° , left : 30 ° / 0 ° / 40 ° .    1.9279544268698043
no recurrence of ho was observed in x - ray .    3.1657010315060186
the patient is able to work in his profession as farmer .    2.9610540696031924
gastric teratomas are rare and mostly benign .    2.6980992085385105
they frequently become evident as a palpable abdominal mass .    2.2599908229712113
we present a 6 - month - old male infant with a history of bleeding of the upper gastrointestinal tract .    2.9017854550509146
after in UNK excision the histopathology was that of a benign gastric teratoma .    2.262981270250406
our method of reading the diagnosis and the subsequent therapy are described .    2.7780431427935763
the aim of this prospective study was to assess the clinical and prognostic relevance of patent foramen ovale - in contrast to risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources - in 208 patients with cerebral ischemic events .    2.5763654191144676
all patients underwent neurological examination ( doppler , ct , nmr ) as well as transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography .    2.4655847465637373
a patent foramen ovale was found in 75 patients ( 36 % ) .    2.8847726874677355
with regard to risk factors for atherosclerosis patients with closed resp .    2.7450333730028147
patent foramen ovale revealed significant differencies for age , hypertension , diabetes and use of oral contraceptives .    2.6821237582889927
cardioembolic sources showed significant differencies for atrial fibrillation and atrial septal aneurysm .    2.539853456969297
multivariate analysis of risk factors for atherosclerosis and cardioembolic sources revealed hypertension and diabetes as age dependant risk factors in patients with closed foramen ovale .    2.47170286579509
in patients with patent foramen ovale the use of oral contraceptives was found as an independant risk factor for cerebral ischemic event .    2.673994826815276
patients > 60 years with cerebral ischemic events had more often a closed foramen ovale .    2.175345392474737
dependant on age patients with closed foramen ovale showed a higher frequency of hypertension and diabetes .    2.476201934463841
in addition these patients revealed more often atrial fibrillation .    2.2736793468062673
patients with patent foramen ovale had fewer risk factors for atherosclerosis or cardioembolic sources but presented more frequent the use of oral contraceptives or atrial septal aneurysm .    2.235134567721172
a retrospective study of 86 motorcycle accidents that occurred in the year 1992 is reported .    2.4948106856112453
examination of the case histories supplemented by telephone UNK yielded the following results : 90 . 7 % of our patients were male and their average age was 28 . 8 years ; the age group between 25 and 30 years was the most frequently involved ( 27 . 9 % ) .    2.558598089929441
most motorcycle accidents happened during UNK UNK out in the UNK .    2.7888671412725263
special injury patterns were found for injuries of the upper and the lower extremity .    3.0832406658968665
lower extremity injuries ( 46 % ) , and especially open tibia fractures ( 19 . 7 % ) , were among the most common injuries sustained by UNK in crashes .    3.3243608046115103
injuries of the upper extremity most frequently took the form of fracture of the distal radius ( 18 . 8 % ) .    2.8496208140737975
the average stay in our hospital was 35 . 4 days .    2.7162214293818896
in 23 . 4 % of cases the patients had to change their job after the accident .    3.3329572844067235
more than half the crashes happened with UNK with between 500 and 750 cc stroke volume .    2.0180186806969
over a third ( 34 . 5 % ) of the patients had held their driving UNK for more than 8 years .    3.1745471816090993
a UNK is made for more preventive measures , such as better driving instruction , better road conditions and UNK changes , against motorcycle crashes .    2.2345061288091146
from the aspects of cost and the rate of complications it is reasonable to strive for a surgical treatment as soon as possible after the crash .    2.404319485263521
reflex sympathetic dystrophy ( rsd ) is a syndrome affecting an extremity after a minor trauma or operation .    2.449791312995548
at the moment there is no consensus about the pathogenesis of rsd .    3.26035576008957
in UNK paul sudeck suggested that the signs and symptoms of rsd may be provoked by an exaggerated inflammatory response to injury or operation of an extremity .    2.1007092144821344
his theory found no UNK , as most physicians believe that rsd is initiated by an hyperactive sympathetic system .    2.253921126439538
we performed various clinical and experimental investigations , including the effects of antiinflammatory treatment .    2.852490514867616
erectile failure after radical prostatectomy is a common postoperative disorder .    2.8696401145922263
however , nerve - sparing technique provides in about 50 - 60 % erections sufficient for sexual intercourse .    2.1782418015482126
damage to the cavernous nerves or vascular injuries are responsible for erectile dysfunction .    2.6063774486727413
alprostadil is most commonly used for self - injection monotherapy or in combination with other vasoactive drugs .    2.6825055896302086
intraurethral administration of alprostadil failed to reproduce promising early results .    2.207536436786
the oral drug sildenafil showed to be effective in patients with partial erections , however , it failed to work after non nerve - sparing radical prostatectomy .    2.8118543778858602
negative pressure devices and penile prosthesis can be considered as alternative UNK options .    2.5662057554363114
autologous n . UNK transplantation during radical prostatectomy might further improve erection rates in the near future .    2.046632607091543
pregnancy causes substantial changes in the cardiovascular system : cardiac output ( 40 % - 50 % ) and blood volume ( 40 % ) increase whereas systemic peripheral resistance and arterial pressure decrease .    2.7013191343662766
the rise in progesterone and estrogen levels accompanying pregnancy UNK the renin - angiotension - aldosterone system .    2.017217730367559
increased prostaglandin production follows renin activation ; simultaneously , the arterial vessels show diminished angiotension sensitivity .    1.957966679481428
the result is pronounced vasodilatation .    2.5376213822601406
heart disease remains the most important UNK cause of maternal death .    2.9050096209014016
the physiological changes in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy influence cardiac diseases in different ways .    2.420007533093571
pregnancy , labor , and delivery appear to be well tolerated in UNK with an atrial septal defect , ventricular septal defect , and UNK ductus arteriosus .    2.7598690242237147
sometimes congestive heart failure occurs and appropriate medical therapy is necessary .    2.5431712448875152
pregnant women with UNK cyanotic congenital heart disease ( eisenmenger ' s syndrome , UNK of UNK ) constitute a high - risk group because of right ventricular insufficiency and hypoxic attacks .    2.8769162654170906
the consequences for anaesthesia in parturients with congenital heart disease are discussed .    2.5390392157141743
the symptoms of acquired mitral or aortic stenosis are aggravated by the physiological changes in the cardiovascular system during pregnancy ; the clinical symptoms of valve insufficiency are UNK by vasodilatation .    2.2899982613248504
UNK cardiomyopathy clinically shows similar features to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy .    2.172053379724168
the basis of treatment is the same as that of congestive heart failure , with the therapeutic spectrum ranging from diet to heart transplantation .    2.7477953865290257
women with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy tolerate pregnancy , labor , and delivery surprisingly well .    2.248592383379373
vaginal delivery is possible , but epidural anaesthesia is contraindicated .    2.6480690913476446
hypertensive disorders associated with pregnancy are classified into three groups : chronic , treatment , and preeclamptic hypertension .    2.396702174588209
whereas chronic and transient hypertension do not affect the outcome of pregnancy UNK , pre - eclampsia presents a potential danger to mother and fetus .    2.162426610163223
pre - eclamptic hypertension is accompanied by low cardiac output and plasma volume .    2.5527365942104616
an upregulation of angiotension receptors enhances vascular reactivity , with the consequence of high peripheral resistance .    2.295804700251367
for antihypertensive therapy UNK , - UNK , and magnesium sulfate are the drugs of choice .    2.887467220700359
a generalised recommendation of anaesthesia for the pre - eclamptic UNK cannot be made because both general and epidural anaesthesia have risks of severe side effects .    2.268531862095759
ct with multiplanar reconstruction of the jaws ( UNK ) is the method of choice for the radiographic assessment of the mandible and maxilla .    3.6011645686226155
it is instrumental in UNK the relationship between bony lesions and the adjacent anatomy .    2.809892923745917
therefore , this technique allows precise evaluation of the UNK details of the oral cavity .    3.3488161053165935
using it , distinct characterization of pathology including infectious , metabolic , congenital and neoplastic lesions can be obtained .    2.1733094896352387
the histopathology of bone marrow in primary myelodysplastic syndromes ( mds ) is described , with reference to the fab classification .    2.486403021371866
variants such as hypoplastic , thrombocythemic and fibrotic mds are recognized from their histopathology and must be incorporated in the fab classification .    1.963636744891888
the clinical significance of hypoplastic , thrombocythemic and fibrotic variants is illustrated by the survival rates and leukemic transformation in these patients .    2.027894646049076
histopathological classification according to the fab system corresponds with cytological classification , as proven by the distribution of the subtypes , blood values , leukemic transformation rates and survival times .    2.3154746360987635
finally it is even possible to elaborate a prognostic score for survival based on histological features of diagnostic biopsies , which emphasizes the importance of histopathological examination of bone marrow in mds patients .    2.2263087572462688
a 58 - year - old man developed an extensive pilomatrical carcinoma in the left axilla .    2.5947759294722235
clinically , a squamous cell carcinoma was suspected .    2.8151332850902038
histological examination revealed the presence of proliferating basaloid cells with many atypical mitoses and mass necrosis infiltrating into the subcutaneous tissue .    2.199209157548282
the tumor was removed by micrographic surgery with a 2 cm safety margin .    2.5238617556589564
histological examination of 2 regional lymph nodes as well as further diagnostic procedures ruled out metastases .    2.7542867451264885
we review the clinical and histopathological differences between UNK and pilomatrical carcinoma , as well as the published cases of the malignant variant .    3.269916519811204
introduction : recent studies evaluating lay people and health care professionals about their process - quality checking the carotid pulse demonstrated poor diagnostic accuracy and more time needed than suggested in international guidelines for cpr .    1.7857694868611405
so far there was no scientifically UNK data about the quality of checking the breathing .    3.0533365175267497
study objective was the evaluation of the effectiveness of checking the breathing in an emergency situation with four different groups : lay people ( l ) , emt / paramedics ( e ) , medical students ( m ) , physicians ( p ) .    2.332472025519554
taking into account the increase in worldwide human migration , leprosy is of growing importance in the differential diagnosis of dermatological diseases encountered in central europe .    2.3340215774673485
we report on the case of a young man from UNK who developed UNK UNK and plaques on his trunk and proximal limbs .    2.2988423830923654
the diagnosis of UNK leprosy could be made in consideration of the histological pattern of infiltrating leucocytes and detection of numerous acid - fast mycobacteria on skin biopsy .    2.1622164695416886
the results of the physical examination as well as routine laboratory and immunological parameters were consistent with this form of leprosy .    2.7334207964210653
due to glucose - 6 - phosphate - dehydrogenase deficiency , treatment with dapsone was contraindicated .    2.2430362607858916
with high - dose rifampicin and clofazimine therapy , the skin changes cleared over the course of 11 months following a leprosy reaction type ii ( erythema UNK UNK ) that developed during a phase of discontinued therapy due to low patient compliance .    2.482946529375772
in the last few years two placebo controlled studies ( european cooperative acute stroke study and national institute of neurological disorders and stroke study ) analyzed the effect of systemic thrombolytic therapy with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator ( rt - pa ) in acute hemispheric stroke .    2.076575445340605
both studies showed a positive UNK effect for the rt - pa treated patients .    2.7567354450251504
the number of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was higher in the rt - pa treated groups .    2.7196530120697537
the results determine possible clinical or neuroradiological predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with rt - pa therapy .    2.1041747267007715
the role of enteroviral myocardial infection in the development of dilated cardiomyopathy could only be substantiated after the introduction of molecular biological techniques ( polymerase chain reaction , in - situ hybridization ) in virological diagnostics of dilated cardiomyopathy .    2.636781322482577
by using histological and especially immunohistological techniques for the detection of myocardial inflammation in patients with the tentative clinical diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy , a differentiation between inflammatory cardiomyopathy and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of the who classification 1995 ( 31 ) was made .    2.592002198973211
inflammatory cardiomyopathy is defined by myocarditis in association with cardiac dysfunction and is diagnosed by established histological and especially immunohistological techniques .    2.2637634168354954
the combination of histological , immunohistological , and UNK techniques enabled a subgroup analysis of the incidence of enteroviral myocardial rna in patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy in comparison to patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy .    3.0524411994561027
the intended - dynamic group therapy , until the unity almost unknown in west - germany , represented the most important form of therapy in the former gdr .    2.484424964311094
its development , its conception of the relevant relationship between group - dynamic and psychoanalytic concepts and in particular its UNK of psychoanalytic concepts are discussed .    2.1101356184568805
this raises the question of defining the position of this therapy form with the focus on the UNK about its proximity to psychoanalytic therapeutical concepts .    2.661438701492439
even if we take into account that in the gdr there were very reduced possibilities to UNK psychoanalytic and particularly drive concepts , in our view the intended - dynamic group therapy cannot be considered as a psychoanalytical form of therapy .    2.2080255024364903
it represents a specific therapeutical development of the former gdr which is strongly oriented at social UNK .    2.518193043459344
it is first of all oriented at the attitude change reached by the group , that means , at the manifest , conscious behaviour of the patient and therefore focusses at the normative level of behaviour regulation in groups in the sense of interactional group therapy .    2.137038172906619
the authors view this form of therapy as a " historical compromise " in the field of psychotherapy under the circumstances of the former gdr and in this way they take into account both its advantages and its weaknesses .    2.4620541715786066
in a prospective study of central fractures of the talus , radiological data ( plain radiography , ct , mri ) were scrutinized in terms of correlation with histological findings ( biopsy taken at time of screw removal ) .    2.368173055806547
the study looked at nine fractures in eight patients aged 14 - 48 years .    2.202468502671624
there was one fracture of hawkins type i , one fracture of type ii , four fractures of type iii , and three corpus fractures .    2.479183775204622
all were operated on within 24 h after injury ; seven had screw fixation , two had adaptation with k wires .    2.2299900622039908
the patients were kept non - weight - bearing for 14 - 53 weeks .    2.4302463665138316
duration of follow - up was 2 years or more in all but one patient .    3.053726903026835
in the final radiograph the talus was intact in four patients , while four showed a partial avascular collapse ; in one patient , a partial collapse was doubtful .    2.3544840443197135
histology taken 16 - 52 weeks after injury showed UNK - free original bone in all cases , with deposition of new bone varying in extent .    2.228721441989416
hawkins sign was partially positive in six patients , positive in one , and negative in one .    2.4323874860019528
decalcification as well as fracture healing can be better followed by ct than by plain radiography .    2.801180384172959
mri appeared normal in five patients , partially pathological in two , and abnormal in one .    2.3533956042990516
a positive hawkins sign and normal signal behavior can be seen as prognostically favorable signs .    2.2462580733546402
however , in the case of a central talus fracture , even with a favorable course osteonecrosis of at least a part of the talus with gradual replacement by new bone occurred .    2.762996569672353
vascularization of the central talus seems to be disturbed more frequently than is reflected radiologically .    2.909933904712631
purpose : to assess the value of functional magnetic resonance urography for the noninvasive postoperative evaluation of renal transplants .    2.3434748787046313
methods : a saturation inversion projection sequence allows the selective imaging of strongly t 1 weighted signal from the mr contrast agent .    1.8869984947319687
a coronal UNK leads to images comparable to conventional urography which can be acquired as a sequence with four images per minute .    2.2492923992273166
results : 15 patients with urologic questionable findings after renal transplantation were studied .    2.2700124701202435
fmru revealed in 6 patients normal findings , in 6 moderate dilatation of the renal pelvis without any urodynamic relevant obstruction .    2.375248175515389
the imaging quality in all studies was diagnostic and UNK relevant .    2.525563629810275
conclusion : fmru can be used as a noninvasive technique for the assessment of renal transplant in cases with suspicion of complication in the excretory system .    2.668445338053599
the infection after intramedullary nailing is a severe complication , which is hard to eradicate .    2.7250463531005193
from 1984 to 1991 fifty - five patients with infected intramedullary nails of the lower extremity were included in this trial .    2.716177151399863
twenty - one patients had an infection of the femur .    3.087594715320346
thirty - four patients had a primary infection of the nail , twenty - one patients had multiple operations with periods of infection prior to nailing .    2.5342295663532037
all patients had signs of a chronic osteitis and sinus formation .    2.6813613564166427
at the time of the follow - up the success of the procedure was evaluated regarding recurrence of infection , range of motion of the extremity and patient comfort .    2.9858108220363992
the mean time of observation was 10 , 1 + / - 4 , 9 years .    2.7179426676859455
all patients with initially infected intramedullary nails had no recurrence of the infection , compared to 62 % of those with multiple operations prior to nailing .    2.5297975558729284
at the time of the follow up all fractures had healed .    2.7067042230895773
85 % of the patients performed full weight bearing .    3.3292147138773744
32 patients ( 91 % ) had good or excellent rom of the adjacent joints .    2.86293859824632
the discussion about the therapy of the posterior cruciate ligament persists .    3.561591312631385
conservative treatment , augmented repair , and reconstruction with autografts are discussed .    2.306855916718359
from 1993 to 1997 , 49 patients with posterior cruciate ligament rupture had repair UNK ligament augmentation of 3 mm .    2.429300719025745
there were 21 isolated and 28 combined ruptures .    2.276331988083463
in 5 cases bony avulsions were UNK by screw or additional hook plate .    2.1972491470911883
investigation of 36 patients , in 15 cases with isolated ligamentous ruptures was made .    2.44070953858809
osseous avulsion had good results in all cases .    2.9246615519078096
isolated posterior cruciate ligament rupture showed good stability in 7 of 15 cases and instability of 2 + in 8 cases .    2.363605528666613
the medial range lysholm score was 76 . 8 ( + / - 21 . 6 ) , the oak score showed 2 very good and 5 good results , 3 fair and 5 bad results .    2.619019181457661
using the ikdc score led to 3 very good and 4 good results , 2 fair and 6 bad results .    2.346491613286003
using subjective criteria , 10 patients described results as very good or good , 2 fair and 3 bad .    2.2584761952799997
posterior cruciate ligament rupture with additional knee injury or fracture of the leg showed bad results in 60 % of cases , and good or fair results in only 40 % .    2.585994707946204
we think augmented repair of fresh injury of the posterior cruciate ligament can be used as an alternative therapy to reconstruction with autograft .    2.9498617270448184
for this study , data from 24 departments of dermatology ( UNK patients ) were evaluated retrospectively and separately for 1995 and 1996 .    2.6358235238417373
with decreasing frequency , nickel , fragrance mix , balsam of peru , and thimerosal yielded positive reactions most often ; UNK high numbers of positive reactions were also seen with UNK l - 101 and UNK .    1.8805106286651407
differentiated lists of allergens were compiled for 1995 , referring to subgroups of patients ( defined by gender , age , localization of eczema , geographical region , occupation , sensitization ) and particular problems .    1.9511696287448737
in men , percentages of positive reactions were markedly lower for nickel , fragrance mix and balsam of peru than in women .    2.028891119378682
younger patients reacted more often to thimerosal and older ones to topical medical preparations .    2.020080963139124
medical allergens were also often positive in patients with leg eczema , whereas occupational allergens were found more frequently in patients with hand eczema .    2.9052161739724527
a comparison of positive reactions obtained in distinct geographical regions was problematic because of differences between test populations .    2.154851397717955
the spectrum of allergens found in UNK was similar to that of the whole test population .    2.9993490070197337
patients with positive reactions to nickel and fragrance mix had more positive reactions to unrelated allergens than the total test population .    2.199482257183477
sex - and age - adjusted frequencies of sensitization revealed a decrease in reactions to nickel and an increase in reactions to mercury allergens from 1995 to 1996 .    2.3926234150957257
the clinical relevance of mercury reactions was often not apparent .    2.3703487739341025
differentiated lists of allergens can be used to improve the quality of diagnostic and prophylactic procedures in allergic contact dermatitis .    2.7405558196421156
intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin ( bt ) induce a localized , long - lasting paresis of the target muscle that can be graded by the bt dose administered and that is free of major side effects .    2.206351797387913
with this profile , bt can be used for symptomatic treatment of various disorders caused by pathological muscle UNK .    2.5380437454069162
these disorders occur frequently in patients in institutions for neurological rehabilitation .    2.470976376560417
they are difficult to treat with conventional methods , can cause major suffering and induce substantial costs for our health care system .    2.2402181421002942
in the present study we therefore sought to delineate the use of bt in rehabilitative neurology .    2.4586855666715026
regardless of the etiology of the particular muscle hyperactivity syndrome , five main indication groups are identified : ( 1 ) improvement of function of the hyperactive muscles ; ( 2 ) relief of pain in the hyperactive muscles ; ( 3 ) improvement of patient care ; ( 4 ) avoidance of sequelae in joints , tendons , ligaments , and teeth ; ( 5 ) various special indications .    2.416268217795678
myocardial infarction shows a circadian pattern with a maximum in the early morning hours .    2.5243853664003315
in patients with sleep - related breathing disorders ( srbd ) , it is assumed that apnea - associated changes of hemodynamics , blood gases , and UNK lead to a higher frequency of myocardial infarction during sleep .    2.7933379283513684
this investigation analyzes the circadian pattern of myocardial infarction in patients with and without srbd .    3.1976798881687905
the novel UNK antigen melanoma inhibitory activity ( mia ) is expressed in the uveal melanoma and it ' s metastatic lesions .    2.047383471724831
persistent atrial fibrillation ( af ) is associated with shortened action potential duration ( apd ) and reduced atrial refractoriness .    2.276197030611071
remodeling of ion currents responsible for ap morphology has been proposed as a major mechanism in persistent af .    2.1743022307181508
in the present study we investigated the activity of the cardiac l - type ca2 + channel and the mrna transcription of the cardiac l - type ca2 + channel subunits in patients with persistent af compared to patients in sinus rhythm ( sr ) .    2.3140960957493353
right atrial appendages of 10 patients in sr and of 5 patients with af were used for UNK UNK to record l - type ca2 + currents ( ica , l ) by the patch - clamp technique .    2.257277201666286
right atrial appendages of 16 patients in sr and of 5 patients with af served as sources for determining the mrna expression of the l - type ca2 + channel 1c - , 2 / - , a - , and b / c - subunits by semiquantitative rt - pcr .    1.9901567455945932
ica , l density was reduced by 70 % ( p < 0 . 001 ) in af patients compared to the sinus rhythm group .    2.6478902141485583
cell sizes , expressed as cell UNK , were identical in both groups .    2.5853880602155144
mrna expressions of the 1c - subunit and the b / c - subunits were reduced in af patients by 18 . 9 % ( p < 0 . 05 ) and 77 . 7 % ( p < 0 . 005 ) , respectively , while mrna UNK of the 2 / - and the a - subunits were not significantly different between sr and af patients .    2.547628934063181
34 patients aged 3 months to UNK underwent transcatheter - occlusion of their patent ductus arteriosus with detachable coils ( cook ) .    2.023333032028049
eight patients had a residual ductus after previous implantation of a UNK - occluder ; 7 patients had various other cardiac malformations in addition .    2.6372111690712514
only 6 patients had a large ductus with a diameter between 3 and 4 mm ; all had systolic - diastolic murmurs .    2.4461823944279995
all other patients had ductus - diameters below 3 mm ; three of them had systolic - diastolic murmurs , 17 had systolic murmurs , and 8 patients had no murmur at all .    1.9776832670871956
one coil was used in 23 patients , 2 coils in 9 , and 3 coils in 2 patients .    2.659572831229062
there were no complications of the intervention .    2.658823838686414
within 24 hours 31 patients ( 93 % ) had complete closure of the ductus and 32 patients ( 94 % ) after 6 months .    2.537691103481946
coil - embolisation of the persistent ductus is a quick , safe and cheap method to close a ductus and has clear advantages compared to an operation .    2.1339827348223914
the volume of preoperative screening investigations for outpatient anaesthesia ranges from few , selectively ordered investigations to extensive routine diagnostic procedures .    1.9846375740886735
it seem appropriate to reevaluate benefit and efficacy of routine preoperative assessment programs .    2.3221954197947796
the purpose of preoperative diagnostic is to assess the risk of anaesthesia and surgery for the patient .    3.3579153201819048
as shown by a number of studies , preoperative screening investigations seldom disclose new pathological findings of clinical relevance .    2.6400228414994777
extensive use of costly diagnostic procedures considerably increases health care UNK .    2.1975244766837423
a more selective approach to order preoperative investigations promises considerable UNK .    2.2276193202590546
to achieve UNK UNK an efficient organisation of UNK assessment must be established to avoid costly delay and on - day - of - surgery - UNK .    2.2204207094156527
there is no medicolegal obligation to perform routine diagnostic testing .    2.2832050148429186
the anaesthetist must be sufficiently informed in time to assess the perioperative risk of the patient and to alter anaesthetic management as necessary .    2.8619342115266964
according to the presented studies a clinical history and a thorough physical examination represent an effective method of screening for the presence of disease .    2.629513511606778
careful medical history evaluation and physical examination can avoid extensive investigations in apparently healthy individuals and the latter should only be ordered if indicated .    2.0496427281843035
the UNK odontogenic cyst ( boc ) is considered a rare multilocular variant of the lateral periodontal cyst .    2.3613095160584052
the origin of the boc can be seen in aberrant odontogenic tissue .    2.710649433012054
the boc is found especially in the premolar region of the mandible , as well as in the frontal region of the maxilla of patients aged between 60 and 70 years .    3.2365281238465013
most of the 11 published articles of boc have shown high rates of recurrence .    2.3052320528530044
histopathologically the boc is marked by multilocular cysts lined by a thin , UNK epithelium .    2.110792150826743
clusters of glycogen - rich epithelial cells may be noted in nodular UNK of the cyst lining .    2.69849631543002
for the clinician , the differentiation of the boc from the keratocyst and UNK is relevant .    2.654958603333863
one case of a large boc ( 65 - year - old male , boc UNK 33 - 45 , diameter 5 cm , radiographically and histologically multilocular ) is presented with a review of the literature , including the therapeutic management , and the possible diagnostic criteria are discussed .    2.7962485231771974
the immunohistochemically determined expression of cytokeratin ( ck ) 13 UNK the histogenetic origin of the boc from the squamous epithelium of the oral cavity and excludes the origin from the small salivary glands .    2.07065506925338
the expression of ck 19 and the lack of expression of p53 , as well as the higher proliferation rate of the basal epithelial cell layer by the boc , may be useful for distinction between the keratocyst .    2.7331753549821096
within the framework of a study on vocational rehabilitation of the mentally ill , we examined 83 schizophrenic outpatients enrolled in a work therapy program .    2.294898672335179
the course of illness and rehabilitation was documented over a 3 - year period by means of annual follow - up examinations .    3.264474862252945
the sample comprised 44 men and 39 women with an average age of 35 years ( sd + / - 8 , 5 ) .    2.608830842796929
the majority were chronically ill patients with a history of frequent and long psychiatric hospitalization .    2.7484915328107564
after 3 years , 22 % of the patients were integrated into the general labor market , 26 % had UNK employment , 23 % were still in work therapy , and 29 % were UNK .    2.604756214794944
besides the patients ' subjective expectations , early introduction of rehabilitative measures and a favourable course of illness were found to be predictors of a successful rehabilitation leading to vocational integration .    2.2859148481446248
outpatient work therapy is a contemporary , effective organizational form of UNK .    2.5409891363643236
it may contribute to improved vocational competence and integration , reduced psychiatric hospitalization and stabilized psychopathology .    2.170197523599016
objective : based on personal observations the neuromuscular blocking potency of atracurium was supposed to be diminished in purulent intrathoracic diseases .    2.0262625969633796
this hypothesis was tested in a prospective clinical trial .    3.3205154017015346
aim of study : goal of this survey is to give an overview of anaesthesia for caesarean section in germany .    2.6458126023298205
ultrasound contrast agent is used in color doppler flow imaging for signal enhancement in perfused vessels .    2.302904625359712
we present our experience with its use in the head and neck area and the results obtained .    3.3372762221840944
up until now , 30 patients with carcinomas of the oral cavity or the maxillary sinus , tumors of the mandible and metastatic or inflammatory lymph nodes have been examined .    2.643664656659259
conventional b - scan sonography was supplemented by non - contrast color doppler flow imaging .    2.3671907256226756
depending on the indication , 2 . 5 g levovist in bolus or 4 g fractionated was injected intravenously in a concentration of 300 or 400 mg / ml .    2.377125591551384
the administration of the contrast agent was tolerated by all patients without any side effects and in all cases led to a remarkable enhancement of the doppler signals .    3.0056773932476206
about 15 to 30 s after injection , an enhancement in perfused vessels was detected .    2.1627130913480506
the UNK injection of 4 g led to a lengthening of signal enhancement up to more than 10 min and to the possibility of examining more parts with a single application of contrast agent .    2.567695416555983
in 64 % of the lymph nodes , vessels could only be identified with the administration of levovist .    3.4686847109810666
the general vessel topography could be better evaluated in 83 % of the cases .    2.5523792663383214
the lymph - node - supplying vessels were identified in 8 of 11 patients after the injection of contrast media .    2.771015180595446
additional information , which was gained in 17 patients , increased the certainty of diagnosis or of the therapeutic concept .    2.8730567296501017
by applying signal enhancer in color doppler sonography the fields of examination in the head and neck areas can be expanded .    2.327058524132183
non - syndromic UNK recessive deafness ( UNK ) is one of the most common human sensory disorders .    2.9498021785701956
mutations in the UNK 26 gene have been established as a major cause of inherited and sporadic non - syndromic deafness in different populations .    2.565407752897271
laser - induced thermotherapy is an in situ ablation method for the local treatment of liver tumors .    2.5453049947557136
the basic prerequisite for induction of adequate treatment volumes for clinical use was the development of a UNK application system .    3.014824482643535
in an ex vivo test series , the specially developed application system ( UNK tip ) with UNK j had a higher UNK loading capacity than the UNK applicator with 4200 j , thus enabling the induction of significantly larger lesions with a volume of 7 . 6 cm3 .    2.05830521168258
the results of a further in vivo test series demonstrated that the lesions were subject to a four - phase connective - tissue organization within a 6 - month period .    2.327029042666835
furthermore , the same laser energy ( 4200 j ) was associated with a significantly lower lesion volume of 2 . 5 cm3 in the in vivo than in the ex vivo test series .    2.612090271566224
the influence of liver perfusion on the inducible lesion volume was examined in a further animal experimental study .    2.3334712675865434
by temporarily interrupting hepatic blood perfusion ( pringle ' s UNK ) during laser application , the effective volume could be increased to 50 . 3 cm3 ( p < 0 . 01 ) using an optical beam UNK .    2.100914715869792
these results show that the technical prerequisites for reliable clinical application of laser - induced thermotherapy have been fulfilled .    2.463628131353903
a total of 222 urogenital specimens were investigated with a commercially available polymerase chain reaction ( amplicor test ) for the direct detection of chlamydia trachomatis .    2.302280761223612
the results were compared with those yielded by the conventional cell culture technique .    2.3309992001438204
using cell culture a urogenital c . trachomatis infection could be detected in 72 of 222 patients .    2.426591858067197
the amplicor test yielded a positive result in 83 .    2.6015658820297127
referred to the detection rate of the amplicor test and that of the cell culture , sensitivity was 91 . 2 % for the test sensitivity and 79 . 1 % for the cell culture .    3.1452938358930176
in accordance with other studies , this study suggests that tests based on nucleic acid amplification will UNK cell cultures as the gold standard for the detection of c . trachomatis and also become the method of choice in routine diagnosis of urogenital UNK infections .    2.30174300655165
incidence and clinical significance of cardiopulmonary complications of acute cerebral lesions are still unclear .    2.5926729253576393
neurogenic pulmonary edema ( npe ) is characterized as an acute , protein - rich lung edema occurring shortly after cerebral lesions associated with an acute rise of intracranial pressure .    2.4375177642363517
npe is infrequently diagnosed , usually in association with head trauma .    2.5580668818522136
in contrast to npe , cardiac complications are frequently observed , most consistently in patients with UNK hemorrhage .    2.5877281338093296
typical ecg changes are repolarization abnormalities , similar to those observed in coronary heart disease , and cardiac arrhythmias .    2.746769963072762
the ck - mb may be slightly elevated ; echocardiographic findings show a depressed left - ventricular function .    2.020517122308721
pathological examination reveals UNK necrosis .    2.584596766869284
for adequate treatment , close cardiac monitoring is required in all patients with acute cerebral lesions .    3.160599279289033
benign , non - parasitic liver cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally by abdominal ultrasound or ct scan .    2.1771225351921824
we present the case of a 68 - year - old patient who showed obstructive jaundice due to a hemorrhagic liver cyst compressing the UNK duct .    2.3227843740098963
due to the location of the cyst in the UNK UNK with partial compression of central liver vessels and the meanwhile organized hematoma , operative therapy was preferred in order to prevent secondary complications such as portal vein thrombosis and to exclude a malignant neoplasm .    2.636914275746184
this review summarizes briefly pathophysiology , clinical definitions , pathogenesis , risk factors , diagnostic procedures and principles of therapy and prophylaxis of ischemic stroke .    2.551447061271751
ischemic stroke is defined as a localized lack of cerebral perfusion mainly due to cardioembolic or arterial - embolic occlusion of cerebral arteries or hemodynamic or UNK reduction of cerebral blood flow .    2.1937619227538225
we focused on pathophysiological mechanisms with potential clinical relevance as the role of oxygen and glucose concentration , the therapeutic time window , the role of UNK neurotransmitters , ca2 + - influx , free radicals , and the development of ischemic brain edema .    2.6112279995062466
based on this data the need of an urgent initiation of diagnostic workup and therapy is emphasized .    2.337952310013593
this includes the early basic management with monitoring of blood pressure , ecg , oxygen and blood glucose concentration , and the balance of the water and electrolyte supply .    2.6780683164209433
since specific therapeutic and prophylactic interventions are based on an exact diagnosis with respect to the pathogenesis , the need of an urgent diagnostic workup including clinical examination , laboratory baseline , vascular ultrasound , cranial ct - scan , ecg , and echocardiography is UNK .    2.572026888509446
based on these results appropriate management of certain pathogenetic stroke subgroups is discussed .    2.0805962461953844
new data about the effectiveness of basic care , treatment of edema , neuroprotective agents , and thrombolysis is presented .    2.5084602179868534
indications for the therapy with intravenous heparin , vitamin k - antagonists , antiplatelet drugs , and surgical procedures are summarized .    2.6419040797213698
longitudinal UNK defects of the sternal region including the caudal third were reconstructed in 15 patients during a 3 - year period by using the " vertical ( vram ) - and transverse rectus abdominis muscle " ( tram ) flap .    2.239534438453911
the majority of the defects resulted from chronic osteomyelitis after previous cardiothoracic surgery or were due to former therapy of breast cancer .    2.1567350727130776
three vram / tram flaps were primarily transferred as free flaps with microvascular anastomosis in the axilla region .    1.9312081845111233
nine out of 12 pedicled vram or tram flaps required an additional microvascular anastomosis because of imminent venous or arterial UNK ( " UNK " ) .    2.092141289921985
therefore , operative technique and operating time of the pedicled and free flap for reconstruction of longitudinal sternal defects are comparable .    2.3285192051753865
adequate reconstruction and rehabilitation was achieved in 11 cases .    3.164573378619313
in 2 patients revision and partial secondary defect coverage was required .    2.2621633114079223
two male patients died postoperatively due to their preexisting condition .    2.6453941972808144
the introduction of joints in unilateral fixators enables these for multiple deformity corrections .    2.0654948371659363
axial corrections are performed by additive or UNK techniques using uniplanar joints or by angulation procedures .    2.134549851491335
translation is done by direct movements of the bone fragments or by metaphyseal " double angulation " .    2.5047206493346312
derotation preferably is done as an acute procedure or in the " ring part " of a hybrid frame .    2.341523564663572
unilateral fixators are used to correct and temporarily stabilize until the correction is held by the UNK nail .    2.537509553313643
UNK in the preterm infant represents an interaction of morphological organ immaturity and neonatal management with their respective sequelae .    2.309086415901766
background : morphological changes in the corneal surface after prk may result not only in refraction fluctuations and reduction in visual acuity , but also in changes of contrast sensitivity .    2.3190520006324515
the aim of this study was to investigate whether prk has an influence on contrast sensitivity with and without glare with a subsequent effect on the ability to drive cars .    2.2460781026574903
calcifying UNK atherosclerosis isolated within the descending thoracic aorta causing subtotal vascular occlusion was associated with symptoms such as in aortic coarctation in a 56 - year - old patient .    2.1502665708246744
remarkable in this unique case is the atypical and isolated manifestation of atherosclerotic disease within the thoracic aorta , as well as the tumorous extent of luminal calcification .    2.261324456961609
the osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with obliteration of the sinus has been established in the therapy of frontal sinus diseases that can not be UNK permanently or healed through an endonasal access .    2.379498977739609
the obliteration of the frontal sinus is endangered in cases of multiple fracturing of the posterior frontal sinus wall or if it has been destroyed by an inflammatory process .    2.6890624570969823
in these problematic cases obliteration bears the danger of complications and cranialization of the frontal sinus is therefore the method of choice .    2.3605536256061677
we review 8 patients who were operated on using the cranialization technique .    2.6294964192719164
indications for surgery were a combined fracture of the anterior and posterior frontal sinus wall ( 3 ) , a UNK of the front sinus with extensive destruction of the posterior wall ( 4 ) and a large osteoma of the posterior frontal sinus wall ( 1 ) .    3.305357885490559
the frontal sinus was exposed through a coronal incision , the mucosa and the posterior wall were completely removed and the frontal sinus obliterated with fat tissue .    2.4227340029764166
the anterior sinus wall was replaced after obliteration of the sinus or reconstructed with calvarian bone transplants .    2.0896481562383795
the follow up period was 1 . 8 years ( 11 months to 8 years ) .    3.1612842203340623
all patients underwent postoperatively a clinical ent - examination and radiological assessment by ct - scan or mri .    2.274649284207573
the overall functional and esthetic outcome was excellent .    2.3491758835903327
there were no serious complications nor any recurrence .    2.2974832336641584
the cranialization of the frontal sinus is a reliable and safe variation of the classical osteoplastic frontal sinus surgery with fat obliteration .    2.405196673593162
we present the case of an infant with UNK - UNK syndrome , in whom UNK developed at the sites of UNK bleeding within 6 months after the illness .    2.920267891704772
UNK ataxia type 7 ( sca7 ) belongs to the category of autosomal dominant cerebellar UNK ( UNK ) .    2.084320160393047
the clinical picture is characterised by progressive ataxia and macular degeneration .    2.374358761689644
other common signs are slow UNK , external ophthalmoplegia , and pyramidal tract signs .    2.1354023784946063
the disease is caused by the expansion of an unstable cag trinucleotide repeat in the gene for UNK 7 on chromosome 3 .    2.5927660416914686
sca7 is a rare disorder .    3.5896332039787042
the first case in germany was described only recently .    2.7261001355455696
we report two additional patients , father and son , with the molecular genetic diagnosis of sca7 .    2.3531034463930243
the father carries a trinucleotide expansion of 42 cag repeats , the son 51 .    2.08146332730167
normal alleles range from 7 to 35 cag repeats .    2.3345174714918517
both patients show the typical picture with progressive ataxia and macular degeneration .    2.278407431284728
we found a pronounced anticipation ( earlier disease onset in subsequent generations ) , which is highly characteristic of cag repeat disorders .    2.21176330764123
in the following contribution the under - proportional participation rate of older workers in vocational training is UNK .    2.0468241950897035
regarding the changes concerning the UNK of vocational training to more job - integrated , self - directed and UNK learning the consequences for training opportunities , motivation to learn and performance possibilities as well as institutional basic conditions to optimize the participation of elderly workers in further training are discussed .    2.1284419135014123
tick - borne encephalitis ( tbe ) is the most severe UNK disease transmitted by ticks .    2.469482488363736
the mortality of the central european form is 0 . 7 - 2 % .    3.288698058568179
active immunisation is recommended for endemic regions .    2.7314374512785737
we report on 4 patients with tbe UNK in middle - hessen between 1994 and 1997 ( 2 in 1997 ) .    2.159320257820825
after repeated csf and serum testing the tbe - specific antibodies were found in all 4 cases .    2.4512175863582297
in one case there was also evidence for a prior infection with borrelia burgdorferi .    2.4258910795622444
the results of the initial csf - analysis were atypical in 2 cases ( high cell count of 136 cells / mm3 , total protein up to 1 . 5 g / l ) .    2.4203156204002063
the endemic region for tbe has expanded in northern direction into middle - hessen , a region in which lyme borreliosis is also endemic .    1.8311398603035303
thus , true double infections are possible .    2.3740187545179685
this and the initially frequently atypical csf - findings make the differential diagnosis difficult .    2.3891066651044994
therefore , repetitive csf and blood examinations are recommended .    2.350966035948943
although they are chemically different , there are many similarities in their mechanism of action .    2.5273262976626585
in provocation tests they have equal efficacy on some tests ( allergen , exercise ) , but nedocromil sodium has greater effect on neuronal mechanisms such as UNK challenge .    2.0598458327419245
very few studies compared the two drugs .    2.663498465525321
in children , only one study was done , showing that twice daily nedocromil is as effective as four times daily cromolyn sodium .    2.2660337234153767
thus twice daily administration is one advantage of nedocromil , the other being proven effect of steroid - sparing , which has not been shown with cromolyn sodium .    2.130254370457052
both drugs are recommended as first - line agents in mild persistent asthma .    2.540181454067533
background : we evaluated in this retrospective study the impact of our diagnostic and therapeutic regimens - as illustrated by typical clinical pictures - on the frequency and prognostic values of UNK complications in herpes eyes .    2.359427585692226
the evaluation of brain tumor recurrence and therapy - induced benign changes following surgery and / or irradiation is a diagnostic challenge for imaging methods based on either morphology ( cct / mri ) or function ( spect / pet ) .    2.1600556930138493
thirty - nine patients suspected of brain tumor recurrence at follow - up were studied by fdg - pet and imt - spect .    2.4353190970237226
imt - spect showed a higher sensitivity in detecting low - grade tumors at recurrence .    2.5925235430949183
in contrast to imt - spect , fdg - pet supports sufficient in - vivo grading .    2.26389191823348
both methods can be used to differentiate between tumor recurrence and UNK .    3.0861322902501667
in conclusion the results of our study demonstrate the efficiency of imt - spect and fdg - pet in confirming recurrences and determining the actual tumor grade .    2.463968910185758
a 22 - year - old male presented with a submandibular cystic mass in the ent clinic of berlin - UNK .    2.722863393503798
histopathology revealed a UNK papillary carcinoma in a UNK duct cyst .    3.018094282270574
worldwide only about 150 cases are known .    2.5301944664868232
we describe our diagnostic and therapeutic procedures employed and included tumor excision , bilateral neck dissections and total thyroidectomy .    2.206985184880368
no abnormalities in the thyroid gland but a metastatic carcinoma was UNK in an ipsilateral lymph node in the jugular foramen area .    2.473128093380345
a preoperative 99 tc - thyroid scan and mri study had not shown any evidence for a malignant tumor .    2.190125802167849
the therapeutic approach advocated in literature is controversial but the intraoperative findings in our patient supported our decision to choose a relatively radical but not mutilating therapy .    2.0532545190681812
transforming growth factor - 1 ( tgf - 1 ) is a UNK growth factor in carcinogenesis and UNK multiple cell functions .    2.9907138775715905
we wanted to evaluate the diagnostic meaning of tgf - 1 plasma levels in patients with a biopsy proven prostate cancer .    2.852761002267932
the tgf - 1 blood level was analysed in 394 patients .    2.321940175060184
in 242 patients ( group i ) the blood was taken before any prostate manipulation and biopsy .    2.358787397095692
the tgf - 1 plasma concentrations were almost similar in the group of patients with a prostate cancer ( n = UNK ) and patients with a benign prostate hyperplasia ( n = 85 ; 14 258 pg / ml versus 14 UNK pg / ml , sd 10 516 pg / ml ) .    3.0763941336534906
in 152 patients the blood was taken 6 - 12 months after radical prostatectomy ( group ii ) .    2.4884995408794657
there was no significant difference between the patients with a psa - progress and without psa - progress after .    2.5879209729506347
our results suggest that tgf - 1 plasma levels can not be used to distinguish between patients with prostate cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia .    2.894848750207448
the aim of this study was to compare the psychological stress of patients with different forms of immediate type hypersensitivity and urticaria .    2.6090219287441085
moreover , the patients ' motivation for different forms of psychological treatment was assessed and an indication for psychosocial support was defined .    2.745222819398829
228 consecutive inpatients with insect venom allergies ( ins ) , food intolerance ( food ) , drug UNK ( dru ) and urticaria ( urt ) were evaluated by validated questionnaires regarding psychological strain and motivation for psychosocial treatments .    1.9174372249953173
patients with food intolerance and urticaria showed significantly elevated psychological stress and higher motivation for psychosocial support as compared to those with insect venom allergies and drug intolerance .    2.2100120951712463
patient education was the favourite technique for the patients ( food 78 % , urt 57 % , dru 24 % , ins 17 % ) , followed by relaxation treatment .    2.565728853216345
the most important predictors for the motivation were the wish for self - responsibility , a feeling of helplessness and social limitations .    2.108723208905849
if strong indication criteria are applied , psychosocial support is indicated in only small subgroups of each patient group .    2.4475211914384953
in spite of that , the management of allergic disease should consider the potential need for psychosocial support .    2.543352874992163
the definition of endocrine disrupters is not very sharp .    2.540473829137708
at present all non - physiologic substances which bind to steroid receptors , are defined as endocrine disrupters of which the best studied are estrogenic in nature .    1.94228285627158
many UNK or UNK or their metabolites have estrogenic activity and UNK our surface water .    2.6717522316166917
here they may cause severe UNK of UNK life .    3.179310744853042
only traces of these substances are demonstrable in drinking water .    2.4847750213208153
on the other hand , weak estrogens present in plastic UNK may be ingested by men and therefore be potentially harmful for human health .    1.9316895640108442
on the other hand , many plants produce UNK ' UNK - estrogens ' , particularly UNK products are rich in phyto - estrogens but their high consumption in asian populations are most likely the reason for reduced occurrence of breast cancer .    1.9833017673193187
many plant extracts used for human medication also contain phyto - estrogens and are beneficial in the treatment of UNK complaints .    2.3631720768739055
hence , not all endocrine UNK must be harmful to human health , in fact , some of them ( clearly phyto - estrogens ) may have beneficial effects .    2.2568296444163187
germany ' s new protection against infection act ( UNK ) will take effect on january 1 , UNK .    2.640401450332169
it will result in an increase of notifications on reportable infections .    2.734496274159889
counties and states have to adjust the infrastructure of their reportable disease notification systems to meet the demands of the new legislation .    2.1116076972282394
an increased demand for human resources at the non - medical staff level is anticipated .    2.4729433403785417
continuing education programs for medical and non - medical staff at public health offices are mandatory .    2.5163194771060553
physicians in private practice , hospitals and diagnostic laboratories and leaders of nursing homes are target groups for special information .    2.1252293727052898
a timely review and epidemiological evaluation of all notifications UNK by county health offices has to be performed at the state level . this is a UNK for immediate response in case of non - localized increases in reported disease incidence .    2.7216659703046866
the author advocates the development of an epidemiological rapid reaction scheme ( epidemiological fire brigade ) in which public health physicians at the county , state , and federal level cooperate in a gradual response to outbreak situations according to actual demand .    1.8369171405033893
we report on an 8 year old boy and a 12 year old girl with intermittent UNK loss of blood and mucus , impaired defecation and recurrent abdominal pain .    2.314321266042955
on endoscopy isolated ulcers were seen in the rectum only , whereas the colonic mucosa appeared to be normal macroscopically and microscopically .    2.4664789756061625
biopsies from the borders of the ulcers revealed a hyperplasia of the lamina muscularis mucosae and a fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria mucosae .    2.2129067898243897
these clinical , UNK and histological findings are characteristic for the solitary rectal ulcer syndrome .    2.734907178958065
only 26 paediatric cases ( age at diagnosis 6 - 9 years ) have been published so far .    2.8220737082104623
the interval from first symptoms to final diagnosis ( mean : 3 , 7 years , range : 1 week to 9 years ) is remarkably long in childhood cases .    2.3104903758868294
pathogenetically an internal rectal prolapse with secondary ischemic lesions is assumed .    2.1656982328691883
there is no evidence of an association to inflammatory bowel disease .    2.5275134021035823
the ulcers UNK often resistant to different medical and surgical options .    2.4753832582686517
a UNK of chronic illness in childhood and adolescence is developed .    2.7968639278770846
in a comparative analysis of 29 studies , maximal androgen deprivation ( mad ) was not found to be superior to partial androgen deprivation .    2.4410861871887395
thus , mad cannot be regarded as the new gold standard .    2.5570122321260227
most trials focus on quality of life which - given the palliative aim of the treatment - UNK special attention .    2.862975402491291
this aspect has not yet been evaluated , however , in the largest multicenter study , UNK study UNK .    3.074882685672193
the synergistic effects of lhrh agonists on the prostate are currently being investigated .    2.340053988988763
since no clear prognostic factors exist and reduction of serum - psa levels under mad does not delay progression , the patient must help to make the decision of whether or not mad should be begun .    2.23161294915952
a case of generalized maculopapular rash and local UNK plaques following s . c . injections of either low - molecular - weight heparin or conventional ( high - molecular - weight ) heparin to a 75 - year - old woman is reported .    2.0444115581542044
this rare reaction is described and the literature to date is reviewed .    2.785914023248438
perioperative morbidity and mortality in noncardiac surgery are mainly due to cardiovascular complications .    2.6793375791850638
therefore , perioperative risk assessment is crucial to avoid these adverse events .    2.5088272725124883
in patients above the age of 40 years , the ecg is a basic investigation , often providing hints for cardiovascular diseases .    2.3803805532514732
stress testing and , in special cases , stress echocardiography or scintigraphy ( the latter only in those patients , in which exercise is impossible ) can detect significant coronary artery disease .    2.3437463745018006
the vascularization reduced the perioperative risk in particular in those patients with unstable angina or severe coronary artery disease .    2.7611814608382654
however , prophylactic revascularization the stable patient does not improve overall outcome , because the risk of the revascularizing procedure must be added to the risk of noncardiac surgery .    2.5804468706843
other diagnostic procedures like echocardiography , chest UNK , routine scintigraphy , halter ecg or halter blood pressure measurement do not add information to the perioperative risk assessment , although these techniques might be very relevant in evaluating other coexisting diseases ( heart failure ; valve lesions , in particular aortic stenoses etc . )    1.9995509438237282
and can be useful to improve medical treatment preoperatively ( e . g .    2.7046105713816937
a verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder ( UNK , UNK ) developed in a 66 - year - old woman who had been suffering from interstitial cystitis with UNK ' s ulcer for 10 years .    2.72815299650011
up to now , only 7 cases of verrucous carcinoma of the urinary bladder UNK with UNK cystitis have been reported .    2.4858834785466724
although the development of a verrucous carcinoma as a complication of interstitial cystitis has not been reported so far , the authors regard the chronic irritation of the bladder to be the most important etiologic factor for the malignant transformation .    2.9938419008144783
after conservative management had failed , a radical cystectomy with supravesical urinary diversion was performed .    2.0508103745972264
the characteristics of interstitial cystitis , verrucous carcinoma and surgical management are discussed .    2.3143880190889345
introduction : abdominal actinomycosis is an uncommon disease .    2.54284681467172
nevertheless it should be considered in case of unclear tumor - like abdominal masses .    3.2211390706177108
methods : we report a case of a 49 - year - old patient with an intrauterine device .    3.0554413983728903
the patient was submitted with a solid and painful tumor in the upper abdomen .    2.5980362518819113
after sonography , computerized tomography , UNK and colonoscopy the preoperative UNK diagnosis was a carcinoma of the UNK colon invading the abdominal wall .    3.063448922173521
pathological examination after a right UNK surprisingly revealed an actinomycosis .    2.3248504165741926
results : based on this case diagnostic tools and therapeutic options of actinomycosis of the colon are discussed .    2.582401970896981
conclusions : this case illustrates the importance to consider the possibility of actinomycosis when finding an unclear abdominal mass .    2.323190919064004
after a surgical excision an abdominal actinomycosis requires antibiotic therapy .    2.2525280384324953
long - term treatment of patients with chronic UNK requires integration of many therapeutic approaches , co - operation of several professions , and regard for the views of patients and relatives .    2.6375114976191725
this review deals with practical aspects of pharmacotherapy , psychotherapy , cognitive resp .    2.1547443051332267
psychological treatments , social resp .    2.6664828350883556
milieu therapy , rehabilitation , interventions based on the concept of expressed emotions ( ee ) , UNK and work with relatives .    2.8833238368484304
continuous neuroleptic treatment is indispensable in most cases to achieve social integration .    2.6713862244255795
indications for adding on antidepressants , lithium , carbamazepine , benzodiazepines and other drugs are discussed , as well as treatment of negative symptoms , depression and management of treatment - resistant symptoms .    2.2805072816571808
psychotherapy needs to regard the possibilities of the patient .    2.774233033445814
in the context of a stable long - term relationship , the patient is supported in experiencing himself as a subject capable of action .    2.6285546400292
effectiveness of cognitive treatments to date is limited .    2.5514289831996853
the best results are achieved by social skills training .    2.294534997792045
social therapy , which aims at the improvement of functional aspects of the patient , is of paramount importance .    2.940752747302993
improved possibilities for work rehabilitation are contrasted by difficulties in financing long - term social rehabilitation .    2.3664828766494312
interventions based on the ee concept are highly effective , but are rarely used .    2.7272220146370265
programs that merely convey information without targeting behaviour modification are ineffective .    2.0393797548146617
the functions of facilities of treatment in the community are explained , the integrative role of case - management is stressed .    2.3596295325421797
the effect of a locally applied peppermint oil preparation on tension - type headache was examined in the design of a randomized , placebo - controlled double - blind crossover study for the first time .    2.362526804523867
the preparation was tested against both the reference substance acetaminophen and to the corresponding placebo .    2.5290454707804106
the liquid test preparation contained 10 g of peppermint oil and ethanol ( 90 % ) ad 100 ( test preparation UNK 170 , UNK pharma , berlin ) ; the placebo was a 90 % ethanol solution to which traces of peppermint oil were added for UNK purposes .    1.8401193806693723
the reference preparation contained 500 mg acetaminophen ; the placebo tablet was identical to the verum in size and appearance .    2.0992963080983493
the study included the analysis of 164 headache attacks of 41 patients of both sexes ranging between 18 and 65 years of age , suffering from tension - type headache in accordance with the ihs classification .    2.348078677752995
four headache episodes per patient were treated in a double - blind , randomized crossover design .    2.420665819798393
each headache attack was treated by the application of 2 UNK of the oral medication ( 1000 mg of acetaminophen or placebo ) and the cutaneous application of the oil preparation ( peppermint oil or placebo solution ) .    2.8338699478820044
the oil was spread largely across forehead and UNK which was repeated after 15 and 30 minutes .    2.173459149279914
using a headache diary , the headache parameters were assessed after 15 , 30 , 45 and 60 minutes .    2.142680379969137
compared to the application of placebo , a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution significantly reduced the clinical headache intensity already after 15 minutes ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.1497965480536534
this significant clinical reduction of the pain intensity continued over the one hour observation period .    2.515300966865774
acetaminophen , too , proved to be efficient compared to placebo ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.398131668901182
there was no significant difference between the efficacy of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution .    2.160870941809703
simultaneous application of 1000 mg of acetaminophen and 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution leads to an additive effect which remains below the significance threshold , however .    1.9869390771471978
the patients reported no adverse events .    2.594536946995735
this controlled study showed for the first time that a 10 % peppermint oil in ethanol solution efficiently UNK tension - type headache .    2.1312848757833582
peppermint oil thus proves to be a well - tolerated and cost - effective alternative to usual therapies .    2.8513586477790267
the positive results of several multi - center studies significantly improved the immunomodulatory treatment of multiple sclerosis over the last few years .    2.3988089236441805
it was demonstrated that different compounds are capable to reduce the number of relapses and to modulate the progression of disease .    2.4715645874953562
to improve the transition of results obtained in these studies into daily clinical practice , a consensus group started to prepare a report on the current treatment options for the german - speaking european countries .    2.687133832054912
the aim of this paper is to summarize the current knowledge , compare the results of recent clinical trials with the experience from other therapeutic options and assess their clinical evidence .    2.4518633679079604
dislocated metacarpal v fractures , fixed by percutaneous kirschner wires or other implants near the UNK joint , often show impaired movement despite excellent radiologic findings .    1.9127445643799852
we therefore chose an alternative method using intramedullary kirschner wire osteosynthesis according to UNK .    2.316654076250284
twenty - five patients were operated on in a 3 - year period and movement of the fingers and complications were examined .    2.88286823718861
six weeks after operation all fractures were consolidated in anatomical reduction .    2.5040331455368308
one patient suffering from an early stage of sudeck ' s dystrophy was healed , and no other complications appeared .    2.5040235257582037
three months after treatment all patients achieved free movement of the fingers with anatomical alignment .    2.6546776567006356
we therefore recommend intramedullary kirschner wire osteosynthesis in distal metacarpal v fractures .    2.1857221756167022
aspiration of toxic substances , foreign material , UNK contaminated secretions , or water ( near - drowning ) either immediately leads to cessation of respiration or to impaired ventilation due to airway obstruction , it causes hypoxia due to surfactant dysfunction , and pulmonary infection might develop .    1.8127789121157585
respiratory insufficiency is the resulting consequence which needs immediate and appropriate therapy and intervention .    2.144207768738472
the knowledge of risk factors that promote aspiration injury is important for its prevention and limitation .    2.4371685400505636
mortality varies between 3 and 70 % depending on patients studied , and on the nature and amount of aspirated material .    2.585555557944927
the major cause of death is acute respiratory failure .    2.5325843968256923
the onset of injury to the lung after aspiration is very rapid .    2.646213737900745
therefore , therapeutic interventions like bronchoscopy are often too late .    2.1876073232253495
more importantly , oxygenation should be monitored continuously for timely institution of mechanical ventilation .    2.31987238764845
antibiotics should not be given routinely but a calculated regime is neccessary when signs of infection develop .    2.2900071973203024
prognosis in near - drowning considerably depends on early rescue and successful resuscitation .    2.2508646594815436
a rapid onset of cerebral hypothermia during the accident can help to increase the ischemic tolerance of the brain and makes it neccessary to continue advanced life support until rewarming of the near - drowning victim .    2.164566426695768
anticipation of individual outcome in unconscious patients is difficult .    2.4502067711478532
one third of them survive with a moderate to severe neurologic damage .    2.2935818315170553
the overall mortality of near - drowning is about 11 % .    2.321012259137854
pathophysiological aspects , diagnostic procedures , UNK management and possible prophylaxis of aspiration injuries will be discussed .    2.331002864866881
background : semiquantitative classification of corneal topography after penetrating keratoplasty has the potential for focusing information about the UNK UNK power of the cornea .    2.788330692177725
the purpose of this study was to UNK the procedure of manual semiquantitative classification using a fourier transform of corneal topography power data and to correlate both methods .    2.137846657406656
recently , professional anaesthesiologists organizations , have set up recommendations for intraoperative monitoring .    2.125221930823129
these recommendations are based upon the assumption that anaesthesia - related deaths are largely preventable and that extensive monitoring will reduce mortality .    2.3091824748663203
hypoxaemia appears to be an important pathophysiological mechanism , and this is why oxygen monitoring is given a high priority in safety standards in anaesthesia .    2.4002275550441845
however , no reduction in mortality has been definitively shown to follow the use of any monitoring device in randomized , controlled trials .    2.5518410450342146
four techniques of oxygen monitoring are discussed and evaluated .    2.5886506260930875
oxygen monitoring during inspiration can be recommended , although its implementation will probably prevent only a few anaesthesia - related deaths .    2.4533860427736873
pulse oximetry is certainly highly recommended , but also has some deficiencies which are not sufficiently well known considering the popularity of this technique .    2.3284897658655153
transcutaneous po2 is considered mainly for historical reasons .    2.299868245281992
near infrared spectrometry is a new technique offering noninvasive and continuous monitoring of intracerebral oxygenation .    2.492556461093954
the increasing frequency of stent implantation into coronary arteries is based mainly on assumptions .    2.3742593271492387
one of these assumptions is that stents may prevent restenosis .    2.268442758442187
despite the very tight selection of patients suitable for stent implantation in these two studies , the advantage for stents remained small ( about 10 % less restenosis ) and appeared to decrease with time following intervention .    2.1813357419353494
there is increasing concern about the extension of stenting in an " unrestricted strategy " .    2.106983115293706
this concern was expressed in the acc expert consensus document which was published recently ( UNK 28 , no 3 , september 1996 : UNK - UNK .    2.1420693963554487
based on the lack of data for most of the presently used stent indications the expert group recommended a more selective strategy for the implantation of stents into coronary arteries .    2.4756159020025814
although the safety and efficacy of the hemostatic systems used especially for the above purpose have been sufficiently documented , inadvertent intraluminal vascular occlusion is theoretically possible .    2.0183709838732367
while partial or complete arterial occlusion in conjunction with the vasoseal collagen prototype device has been previously reported , similar complications occurring with the angio - sealtm device were not published .    1.9680670224426908
in this report , we describe a 54 - year old female patient ( height : 150 cm , weight : 42 . 5 kg ) who was transferred for ptca following an acute anterior wall myocardial infarction .    2.273503699627316
immediately after ptca , the angio - sealtm device was UNK utilizing standard technique .    2.180536237598205
no difficulties were encountered during device deployment , however , immediately following device placement active arterial bleeding occurred .    2.257464832926932
due to the UNK of hemostasis , heparin was reversed with UNK to avoid further hemorrhagic complications .    2.601464156131785
following this , the desired hemostasis quickly occurred , but the patient soon complained about symptoms suggestive of an acute occlusion of the right femoral artery .    2.8930508313922303
unsatisfactory attempts as lysis resulted in the patient being transferred to vascular surgery .    2.5354577058938004
the complete angio - sealtm system ( UNK including collagen ) was located UNK , and removed during surgery .    2.6420117746316985
deviations in the axes can be physiological or pathological .    2.366494125586253
during growth , the axes of the lower extremities undergo significant changes .    2.6494853151653457
the femoral neck - shaft - angle decreases from 150 ° on average at birth to 120 ° on average at the end of growth .    2.285573313978329
the lower leg is UNK in a varus direction at birth .    2.9222169142705168
on the basis of an extensive literature search ( dimdi , medline - status at june 1992 ) , the causes of contact urticaria so far known are displayed in tables .    2.1608896342207484
the contact urticariogens can be divided into ( 1 ) chemically defined substances and ( 2 ) chemically undefined biological materials .    2.627691334623633
the causes most frequently encountered in 16 professions are given .    2.4523998635961517
numerous agents are known for medical professions ( physicians , nurses , dentists and dental technicians , UNK surgeons ) .    2.0425450291109084
today , the most frequent single cause of contact urticaria is probably the presence of latex proteins in rubber ( gloves , condoms , tubes , UNK , etc . ) .    2.5893635674137747
when testing is performed a stepwise approach is recommended for safety reasons ( UNK test , prick test , scratch chamber test ) .    2.1570383090493572
for some contact urticariogens a commercial radioallergosorbent test ( rast ) is available .    2.1196511521939096
in the cases reported in the literature it is not always possible to decide definitely whether the pathogenetic mechanism was immunologic ( ige mediated ) or non - immunologic ( toxic or pseudoallergic ) .    2.2352437679753874
when there is a high degree of sensitization ( e . g .    2.801969026637995
to latex ) professional activities must be severely restricted , or even completely discontinued in rare cases .    2.1019081888478475
2 - agonists are being used increasingly in anaesthesia and intensive care medicine because of their antihypertensive , analgesic and sedative properties .    2.4789784780086475
platelets bear 2 - receptors on the cell surface .    2.40417683965913
stimulation of these receptors by agonists induces platelet aggregation .    2.4921530867905046
the present study examined whether in vitro incubation of blood with the 2 - agonists clonidine and UNK decreases 2 - receptor density and hereby influences platelet aggregation .    2.12066884269481
prehospital diagnosis and first line therapy of acute chest pain are among the most frequently encountered challenges for general practitioners and emergency physicians .    2.6347605102986935
acute myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes in general are present in about a third of patients complaining of acute chest pain .    2.610490808088975
the basis of first line therapy is the understanding of the pathophysiology of myocardial ischemia , the clinical symptoms , the diagnostic tools and the UNK available therapeutic options .    3.633475946991765
time is the most critical factor in myocardial ischemia and subsequent infarction with irreversible injury of subendocardial cells starting within 30 - 60 minutes of total myocardial ischemia and with transmural infarction becoming complete in 3 to 6 hours .    2.251207636899489
with 30 % of patients dying within the first hour of ischemia mostly due to ventricular UNK every effort needs to be made to shorten the delay between symptom onset and start of reperfusion therapy .    2.5859230459524034
the present overview concentrates on the armamentarium of UNK diagnosis and the options of first line therapy of myocardial infarction with the aim of a short transport time to the hospital and therefore a short delay to more specific therapies like thrombolysis or ptca .    2.4250996048469764
the aim of surgical intervention in the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism ( phpt ) is the UNK of UNK and UNK .    3.7229892540178717
despite improved diagnostic procedures containing comparatively modified pre - and intraoperative methods to determine the position of the parathyroid glands and the most efficient operative technique including minimal - invasive surgery thereof , success cannot be guaranteed .    2.2456266222642527
therefore , we should strive to avoid reintervention by ensuring a hemorrhage - free , atraumatic , anatomical - orientated operation and providing positive preconditions for reoperation .    1.8432887584822877
success is based on the four UNK of the UNK surgery : history , embryology with anatomy , neck surgery and experience .    3.020112149913091
by means of this principle and the results of surgical treatment in UNK patients with phpt from 1982 until 1998 , we demonstrate a standardized operative technique of phpt .    2.8184667575198823
a 67 - year - old male patient presented with a nephrotic syndrome .    2.85088643107123
biopsy of the kidney revealed the characteristic of fibrillary UNK - UNK on light and electron UNK - copy .    2.740501395716079
amyloidosis , UNK glomerulopathy , light - chain glomerulopathy , UNK , collagen - iii glomerulopathy , fibronectin glomerulopathy ) could be excluded .    2.4930076574826674
besides the case report , differential diagnosis of fibrillary UNK is presented .    3.0920174129031697
two patients were infected with sporotrichosis ; one had the fixed cutaneous form , the other the UNK form .    2.4598683289601047
sporotrichosis UNK was identified in both with a culture from a tissue biopsy .    2.308501325837197
both patients were successfully treated with itraconazole , one received 100 mg and the other 200 mg itraconazole daily over a 3 months period .    2.2436974967452117
abstract mitoxantrone is an UNK UNK agent that has recently been shown to be effective in UNK disease activity in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) as indicated by clinical and mri data .    2.4424462658822326
however , the role of mitoxantrone in UNK treatment of patients with frequent and severe relapses and with rapid progression of disability is less clear .    2.5943968190095608
in this retrospective analysis we report on 15 patients with severe relapsing - remitting ( 9 patients ) and secondary progressive ms with superimposed exacerbations ( 6 patients ) treated UNK with mitoxantrone in our clinical research group from july 1994 to october 1998 .    2.340983376877323
eleven of these patients ( 73 % ) were treated with azathioprine , interferon - beta - 1b or cyclophosphamide before .    3.028940929587259
the patients received mitoxantrone over a period of at least 12 months ( 19 + / - 6 months ) with a single dose of 10 mg / m2 monthly for the first three months .    3.2044552453989232
thereafter , infusions were repeated every 3 months ( total dose UNK mg + / - 45 mg ) .    2.6405747504680925
the annual relapse rate could be significantly reduced from 3 , 0 + / - 1 , 5 in the year before therapy to 0 , 5 + / - 0 , 5 during therapy .    2.913457432001614
nine patients ( 60 % ) were stabilised , while four patients ( 27 % ) showed an improvement of disability .    3.18233912880937
the treatment was well tolerated with only minor side effects .    2.381785710886277
these results although retrospectively obtained confirm previous trials showing that mitoxantrone may be useful in ms patients with frequent and severe exacerbations and / or a rapidly progressive course of the disease who have had other immunomodulatory medication .    2.23982694771675
interstitial cystitis ( ic ) represents a rare and complex inflammatory bladder condition in which diagnostics can be challenging .    2.0631320616130946
strict UNK criteria for its diagnosis were designed for research purposes .    2.5212151544706924
their routine application would miss large proportions of ic patients .    2.1880448974419946
when ic is suspected , history and physical UNK are followed by an evaluation of long - term voiding UNK .    2.858037894057665
large voided volumes ( functional capacity > 250 cc ) or longer micturition intervals ( > 2 h . ) , absence of UNK or symptom - free periods reduce the likelihood of ic .    2.2650761862561537
further exclusion diagnostics include urine tests ( infection ) , cytology ( in - situ carcinoma ) , ultrasound ( calculi , UNK , anomalies ) and UNK in selected cases .    2.474781267396324
bladder capacity measurements under sedoanalgesia are of limited value , since functional low - volume bladders can be mechanically UNK .    2.0072706077083518
UNK under general anesthesia represents the diagnostic standard procedure for ic during which 90 % of ic - patients present with characteristic mucosal UNK after bladder distension .    2.1925552747463173
biopsies are recommended for exclusion of malignancy .    2.830770577056235
potassium - leak testing plays no relevant role in routine diagnostics due to its poor sensitivity .    2.2287179917882836
similarly , complex determinations of novel ic markers ( histamine , tryptase , cytokines , growth factors , substance p , nitric oxide ) are of no relevance in clinical settings and should be restricted to research projects .    2.092151985430931
according to UNK , which may be defined as the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental UNK of signs , objects , and UNK , pain is considered to be a sign ( significant ) with very different meanings ( significance ) either as a naturalistic symptom ( of disease ) or as a symbol used in a metaphorical context .    2.5131780336183103
when following this methodological perspective it is possible to interpret medical as well as UNK UNK on equal terms .    2.8784494348563774
in graeco - roman medical UNK pain was mostly understood as a result and an indicator of disease , but nonetheless as a symptom which seemed to be actively produced by the affected body .    2.2330415735555986
aristotle ( 4th century b . c . ) , celsus ( 1st century a . d . ) , and the famous experimental UNK galen ( 2nd century a . d . ) agreed that pain was a sign of UNK which should be UNK without exception .    2.396094626434573
it was galen who added the disturbance of function ( UNK UNK ) as the fifth cardinal sign of inflammation to the four well - known cardinal signs of celsus ( rubor , UNK , tumor , UNK ) .    2.592281728794291
he also UNK the term UNK to characterize an attack of migraine .    2.2857339479573335
in UNK , galen used a complex pharmacological system which was based upon the four cardinal qualities of humoral pathology .    2.3372377372992412
on the other hand , pain was designed as a multi - dimensional symbol by the famous graeco - roman UNK UNK .    2.0797942523506814
in homer ' s UNK ( 8th century b . c . ) , pain appears transformed into the shape of a scar which is visible and palpable on the UNK ' s leg like an identification UNK , whereas in UNK ' s UNK ( 1st century b . c . ) pain UNK weakness and UNK which can only be UNK by the UNK UNK .    2.6034612754999453
in this article current indications and limitations of neuromuscular monitoring are reviewed .    2.4078665194711983
attention is mainly focused on detection of residual UNK .    2.4676452258287243
new insights in the pathophysiological consequences of residual neuromuscular blockade and the actual criteria of complete recovery are discussed .    2.211616257716132
surprisingly in this context , despite the benefit of neuromuscular monitoring , its utilisation in clinical practice is rather an exception than the routine .    2.5589064192846664
a lack of standardisation of neuromuscular monitoring is probably the major problem on the way to a widespread utilisation of the monitoring .    2.5222457526270707
three patients presented with an acquired green discoloration of their scalp hair .    2.464782693878231
history revealed that all of them UNK regularly in private swimming pools .    2.403515879059047
examination of the hair by atomic emission spectroscopy showed that the green discoloration was caused by an excessively high copper content of the hair .    2.6810612527144024
this UNK discoloration is characteristically related to the uptake of copper from private swimming pools .    2.3129774241111587
a 62 - year - old female patient presented with bullous , intensely itching cutaneous lesions , which clinically and histopathologically resembled dermatitis UNK ( UNK ' s disease ) .    2.475008466057589
therapy with dadps was unsuccessful .    2.570712273482405
because of associated cervical lymph node enlargement and splenomegaly , a lymph node biopsy was taken .    2.286543596923954
histopathology of a lymph node and of the bone marrow confirmed the diagnosis : angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy ( aild ) - type t - cell lymphoma .    2.5929883868898216
intensely pruritic associated skin eruptions are typical for this peculiar kind of lymphoma .    2.193871871020907
these skin lesions are due to inflammatory cells and not to neoplastic infiltrations .    2.568623396669319
this case report is the first report of aild with bullous skin lesions to appear in the literature .    2.4185543995311303
background : the procedures for prophylaxis and treatment of keratopathy following facial palsy with lagophthalmos are unsatisfying from the functional point of view .    2.1406820942765474
the purpose of our study was to compare the diagnostic performance of a 0 . 2 - t mri unit and a 1 . 0 - t mri unit in the evaluation of the anterior cruciate ligament in patients with clinically suspected lesions of this ligament .    2.8190538718394564
twenty four patients with clinically suspected lesions of the anterior cruciate ligament underwent mri of the knee on both 0 . 2 - t and 1 . 0 - t mri units .    3.0631477615896556
three independent UNK evaluated the examinations for primary and secondary signs of a tear of the anterior cruciate ligament .    2.7205942518984396
frequency of these signs was determined for both modalities , and observer agreement was assessed using the kappa statistic .    2.196493340507409
sixteen of 24 patients had signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament on the 1 . 0 - t unit ; the 0 . 2 - t unit detected primary signs in 15 / 16 ( 93 % ) patients and secondary signs in 7 / 12 ( 43 % ) patients .    2.330581859742315
in 8 patients the 1 . 0 t unit showed neither primary nor secondary signs for tears of the anterior cruciate ligament ; in these patients the 0 . 2 - t unit detected primary signs in 1 / 8 cases ( 12 % ) , and secondary signs in 3 / 8 cases ( 37 % ) .    2.5508182677454885
observer agreement was very good for the 1 . 0 - t unit and fair for the 0 . 2 - t unit .    2.375092673149223
there is no substantial difference between 1 . 0 - t units and 0 . 2 - t mri units in the visualisation of primary signs of tears of the anterior cruciate ligament .    2.490652139796755
in the visualisation of secondary signs , 1 . 0 - t units are superior to 0 . 2 - t units , and there is a surprisingly high rate of false - positive results with the 0 . 2 - t unit .    2.9235409521774205
as to the reproducibility of the results , the 1 . 0 - t unit is far superior to the 0 . 2 - t unit .    2.861084503332297
purpose of our study was to develop a reliable model to define clinical stage i UNK germ cell tumors ( nsgct ) being at low risk and at high risk for occult retroperitoneal metastases based on pathohistological and immunohistochemical parameters in order to UNK the therapeutic approach .    2.5401025960956822
3 - 5 paraffin - embedded formalin fixed tissue blocks of 149 clinical stage i nsgct were available from all patients and were analyzed for histopathological features associated with pathological stage : presence / absence of vascular invasion , presence / absence of UNK invasion , percentage of each histological cell type present in the primary tumor .    2.1229116613276275
immunohistochemical expression of mib - 1 , p53 , bcl - 2 , cathepsin d and e - cadherin was evaluated using a semiquantitative scoring UNK .    2.244178890636862
statistical analysis was performed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression models .    2.5062987428702606
percentage of embryonal carcinoma [ % ec ( p < 0 . 001 ) ] and presence of vascular invasion [ vi ( p < 0 . 0001 ) ] were the most significant independent risk factors associated with pathological stage ii disease .    2.197327823134448
combination of % ec and vi allowed correct prediction of final pathological stage in 88 % of patients .    2.2560343374872884
cut - off values including both variables identified correct pathological stage in 131 / 149 patients ( 88 % ) .    2.1335484751406746
% ec and presence / absence of vi appear to be reliable prognosticators to identify both patients at high risk and at low risk for occult retroperitoneal disease .    2.3691357444635748
p53 , bcl - 2 , mib - 1 , cathepsin d and e - cadherin did not appear to be of prognostic value in clinical stage i nsgct .    2.508105316199226
in the framework of rheumatic illnesses , the lungs and pleura are often observed to be involved .    2.3695419142829532
dependent on the basic illness in question , conditions of the bronchoalveolar system , vessels , lymphatic system , and pleura that have developed differently inter - and intraindividually can be diagnosed in UNK variable forms and combinations .    2.246852359628283
in the causal pathogenesis , the initial ( auto - ) immunological alteration of the alveolar septa plays a role .    2.4243241008087812
when the monocytes , macrophages , and fibroblasts are activated , as a result of a chronic inflammatory process there is increasing reparative proliferation , which finally leads to the nonspecific end stage of irreversible interstitial fibrosis .    2.3223302531412675
the incidence and manifestation forms of lung changes show certain differences dependent on the UNK illness ( e . g . , rheumatoid arthritis , systemic lupus erythematosus , progressive systemic scleroderma , dermatomyositis and polymyositis , sjögren syndrome , and mixed connective tissue disease ) .    2.2875510884052814
in addition to vasculitis and UNK of the lung , therapy - induced lung changes must also be considered in the differential diagnosis since almost all basic therapeutic agents can cause this type of lung condition .    2.7243086906476446
scintigraphic imaging identifies pathophysiological processes ; in other words it assesses regional perfusion , permeability , UNK accumulation and bone turnover .    1.9469612245194512
these processes precede morphological changes and this accounts for the high sensitivity of nuclear medicine procedures as well as the low specificity for the differential diagnosis of different diseases with similar pathophysiological characteristics .    2.5829223552193605
this review ( 1 ) describes and evaluates the currently used scintigraphic procedures , ( 2 ) suggests their differential use in certain clinical settings in comparison with alternative radiological methods and ( 3 ) addresses new developments in diagnosis using nuclear medicine procedures .    2.323305209390645
in summary , we advise dynamic bone scanning as a primary scintigraphic investigation .    2.199118551808772
a negative scan excludes osteomyelitis in most cases .    2.612147526520321
the comparison is made with conventional radiology and clinical history .    2.3754399614805433
in cases with short clinical histories ( = granulocytic inflammation ) , leukocyte scintigraphy should be the next diagnostic step ; in chronic processes ( UNK inflammation ) , UNK scintigraphy is advisable .    2.2974095309636784
other scintigraphic methods might be of additional use in experienced hands .    2.4655087342009487
spect is useful for clarifying inconclusive planar scans of the head , spine and large joints .    2.3101216020313946
to assess the clinical effectiveness of glaucoma therapy with diode laser cyclophotocoagulation , 106 eyes ( 51 eyes with primary open - angle glaucoma , 22 eyes with secondary glaucoma , 10 eyes with narrow - angle glaucoma , 23 eyes with other UNK ) of 87 patients were treated .    2.076595016545116
using a diode laser coupled with a fiberoptic probe , ending in a focusing tip , all eyes were treated with 24 - 30 spots over 360 ° and 2 . 8 - 3 . 6 j of energy , 1 . 5 mm posterior to the UNK .    2.5336472806036108
the intraocular pressure was obtained over a period of time until 8 - 24 months after operation .    2.8011157718047426
additionally , morphological changes of the ciliary body were observed in 25 eyes by means of ultrasound UNK .    2.8697999445738933
our objective was to determine the efficacy of eswl treatment in children and the extent of auxiliary measures .    3.4880411637550783
in a retrospective analysis we investigated number of auxiliary measures and the stone - free rate in children after eswl treatment .    2.091302829209004
we report a 44 - year - old female patient who underwent surgery because of a suspected primary tumor of the renal pelvis in imaging procedures .    2.897588899749821
histology revealed the diagnosis of mesoblastic nephroma .    3.4038920319408676
this tumor represents a special entity of UNK that rarely occurs in adults .    2.2470792001328967
there is no UNK opinion on the biological behavior of mesoblastic nephroma because the tumor UNK differently .    2.2872545615223516
the question of whether nephrectomy is indicated if there are no malignant features is also open .    2.4353214783144823
the decision depends on the given case .    3.0296251644373156
nephrectomy can only be avoided if the intraoperative situation allows the tumor to be removed with an adequate distance from healthy tissue .    2.4842990807215584
the safety margin is necessary because mesoblastic nephroma shows UNK spread into the surrounding tissue .    2.189846019896721
cardiopulmonary exercise testing ( cpx ) is a non - invasive method of recording quantitative data from gas exchange and ventilation for the evaluation of oxidative metabolism at rest and during exercise .    2.648713626639042
determination of oxygen uptake ( vo2 ) and carbon dioxide output ( UNK ) describes the activity of anaerobic vs aerobic metabolism .    2.583689688868475
an incremental exercise test measuring gas exchange , ventilation and lactate release was performed in healthy volunteers and in patients suffering from mitochondrial disorders .    2.687395070284338
at rest as well as during exercise patients with mitochondrial disorders differ from healthy subjects with regard to gas exchange and ventilation parameters .    2.735083777496029
during exercise , the decreased oxygen utilization of skeletal muscle and early activation of anaerobic metabolism in these patients are UNK by a reduced anaerobic threshold , reduced maximal oxygen uptake and reduced oxygen pulse .    2.3333096275910403
our study shows that cpx is a sensitive and practical clinical screening method of investigating mitochondrial disorders .    2.145742070489056
since high UNK often remain unnoticed clinically , further study is required in certain cases .    2.351365882472872
the extent of reflux in the esophagus may not represent pathological changes in the hypopharynx .    2.5615106877489118
in such cases 24 - h ph monitoring of the hypopharynx can be a useful diagnostic procedure and may also help detect the pathogenesis of " gastric UNK " .    2.4607174200360866
the occurrence of UNK giant cells in the liver is probably a morphological reaction pattern with the most diverse causes .    2.5243678140844525
in babies and infants , these changes occur in particular in neonatal hepatitis and intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile duct atresia .    2.0518483012485804
viral infections and / or autoimmune reactions are discussed etiologically in giant cell hepatitis in adults ( adult giant cell hepatitis , UNK ) , which is much rarer .    2.815338392949082
in some of the cases , there were UNK high titers against UNK .    3.063113175242455
giant cell hepatitis can occur in the course of hiv infection .    3.379673548212958
these both indicate an infectious cause .    2.4134628545892887
however , the disease cannot be transmitted to UNK .    2.4990462873978285
apart from our case , only one further case is described in the literature in which a completed hepatitis a infection could be demonstrated UNK .    2.8189851650992055
in addition , the titer of antinuclear antibodies was raised in our patient .    2.2640855697933495
in patients with a significant elongation of the acl we propose a new therapeutic regimen .    2.8398300134285037
after mobilisation of the tibial insertion of the acl we UNK the bone block with the attached acl distally .    2.5045854309394695
thus the acl is easily UNK .    2.594967471969428
in accordance with this method , we describe the treatment of a case of a strictly proximal rupture of the acl : the tibial insertion is UNK , the bone block with the attached acl removed from the joint .    3.574444008610143
ex vivo sutures are placed into the acl , the ligament is pulled back into the joint , and the shortening of the ligament caused by the sutures is compensated by slight proximal dislocation of the bone block .    2.7202876846015545
purpose : one aspect of biocompatibility of iols can be tested using UNK microscopy of the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in vivo .    2.296558928824325
background : the paper focuses on the issues , how couples cope with UNK and how this can be facilitated by subsequent children , self - help and professional support .    2.3815188276162287
methods : in a retrospective study , 60 couples , members of a self - help organization , were studied at the average of 5 years ( 2 - 215 months ) after their loss .    2.5608131353143175
depression , anxiety , physical complaints and grief were assessed by standardized questionnaires .    2.307526034463688
a community sample of equal size of men and women of the same age were used as controls .    2.405199379403999
results : average scores of depression and physical complaints were elevated compared to the community sample .    2.4387905403884838
men and women UNK differently with the loss : UNK mothers were more depressed and UNK more about cause and UNK of the death than fathers .    2.4797598209448837
they expressed their grief more UNK and found it more helpful to speak about their loss .    2.027741874336905
the presence of subsequent children was of prime importance for coping with the loss ; an early subsequent pregnancy was UNK with increased anxiety .    2.312346194203292
conclusions : the self - help group serves an important function as a coping resource ; the UNK plays a key role in the psychosocial care of the afflicted families .    2.3976957284020908
a 63 - year - old women developed livedo reticularis during treatment with amantadine .    2.3334422091907228
this reversible side effect of amantadine has been most often seen in women and is frequently associated with persistent ankle edema .    2.314461784206974
we discuss the signs and symptoms , pathogenesis and treatment of amantadine - induced livedo reticularis .    2.6442831606519435
despite the diagnostic criteria of the icd - 10 and dsm - iv , the term borderline has been used in a non - specific way for a long time .    3.0080211888762802
for our investigation we constructed a questionnaire , which contained the icd - 10 diagnostic criteria for the borderline personality disorder ( bpd ) , plus the criteria for the other personality disorders and for the schizotype disorder .    2.387605903450224
the two additional criteria for the bpd used by the dsm - iv were added .    2.724624041258199
800 psychiatrists and psychologists were asked to mark all criteria , which they thought were typical for the bpd .    2.247329068618455
by using the operational diagnostic approach for icd - 10 and dsm - iv a disorder was diagnosed from each of the 162 received questionnaires based on the marked criteria .    2.4806767765092332
in addition each questionnaire contained up to eight other diagnosis .    2.132013492921319
this is a sign for the difficulty to separate the bpd from other UNK disorders or the schizotype disorder by using UNK criteria .    2.1618423485560014
looking at the lack of specifity of the operational diagnostic systems for personality disorders , e . g .    2.4302983085797427
for the bpd which has been discussed by many authors for years , modification of the diagnostic systems should be considered .    2.8064840303928524
neurobiological research has implicated the dopamine and serotonin system in the pathogenesis of self - injurious behavior .    2.660193154946265
the efficacy of UNK drugs has been questioned .    2.755551843392358
opened and controlled investigations have shown UNK is effective for reducing self - injurious behaviour in mentally retardation .    2.1274705346931126
we report about 3 mentally retarded patients which were given open - label UNK for 12 weeks . they participated in a detailed assessment of behaviour symptoms at baseline and the UNK behaviour was weekly rated with the disability assessment schedule ( das ) .    1.9967067478090879
purpose : to test the capabilities of vacuum core biopsy ( vcb ) in the diagnosis of UNK indeterminate lesions .    2.6305767503629576
materials and methods : 120 patients ( 131 lesions ) were examined using vcb with UNK or UNK vacuum core .    2.542549057892485
radiologic information systems ( ris ) and picture UNK and communication systems ( pacs ) are becoming increasingly widespread .    2.0874793677784718
this leads to new demands on the integration of the individual , formerly independent information systems ( ris , modalities , pacs ) .    2.3439621650746756
possible ways of integrating individual systems are introduced .    2.339600368477326
besides the detailed description of different UNK of system communication , its role in the pacs at the university hospital in freiburg is explained .    2.524167881201054
the integration of different information systems still requires the use of UNK UNK .    2.9693939607273774
an appropriate integration generally has been realized in freiburg .    2.2991116422577424
in the near future dicom basic UNK management will standardize system integration and render an UNK workflow concept possible .    1.9314075319320039
even though an available communication standard exists , not all problems in the ris - modality interface are solved .    2.0964441128355165
different data models in the various UNK systems and modalities demand certain degrees of freedom in the standard .    2.193172567938948
thus a satisfactory workflow cannot be guaranteed even when all involved systems conform with the standard .    2.1705462520924774
background : UNK developed 1957 a surgical strategy consisting of three or four operative steps for rehabilitation of patients with unilateral paralysis of UNK and UNK cranial nerve .    2.6039180902325993
these four steps are the following : UNK of the cricopharyngeal muscle , resection of the paralyzed pharyngeal wall , UNK of the paralyzed vocal cord and fixation of the soft palate to the posterior pharyngeal wall which can be facultative .    3.0758903543467966
reconstruction of the navel after tumour excision with subsequent navel resection is of great aesthetic importance for the patient .    2.559967650293596
our method permits reconstruction of the navel during wound closure , by creation of two opposing UNK skin flaps at the excision margin in the midline of the body ; the umbilical fossa is then restored by jointly anchoring these flaps to the UNK UNK .    2.116935016360926
reconstruction has been successfully carried out in this way after melanoma excision in 7 patients .    2.6775907185382732
mammography is an established diagnostic procedure for breast cancer .    2.6684240820419256
data concerning screening mammography are available from nine prospectively controlled trials , the largest series being presented from sweden .    2.0722576975868443
mammographic screening leads to a significant reduction of breast cancer of 30 % in women ages 50 - 59 years .    2.9513486333756402
in younger women ( 40 - 49 years ) the benefit accounts to only 20 % and has not proven to be statistically significant .    2.255720417151867
nevertheless , the major advantage of mammographic screening is detection of the non - palpable tumor < = 10 mm in size .    2.623260547431604
the treatment of these small breast carcinomas leads to long - term survival rates of > = 90 % .    2.765164618473485
mammographic screening programs have been introduced in the usa , canada , UNK and sweden for women in their 5th decade of life .    2.39787945009488
starting yearly lifelong mammography - screening at the age of 40 , the theoretical cancer induction by radiation exposure does not exceed 0 . 1 % .    2.2445940402247295
under highly qualified conditions , it should be possible to minimize false - positive and false - negative screening results .    2.4536440889980122
in germany , screening - mammography is only introduced in patients at high risk for breast cancer .    2.520422881705822
based on medical data , mammography must be a part of screening for women with an average risk - starting at the age of 40 , although there are still open questions needing further clinical research .    2.396199455710761
upper lid closure in facial nerve paresis induced lagophthalmos is often improved by implantation of gold weights .    2.061173219090581
however , the tolerability of gold implants has not always met expectations .    2.1203692933254046
we therefore investigated whether results could be improved by implantation of well - tolerated UNK implants .    2.4517836931075214
methods to determine the mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures are valuable tools in wound healing research .    2.516321290075341
so far standardized testing procedures have not been defined in the surgical literature , which reduces the comparability of results from different authors .    2.340675686648606
therefore we suggest a modified tensile testing procedure which follows german industrial standards ( UNK 53 UNK ) .    2.0037851707957186
the experimental set - up includes an universal testing machine and special clamps .    2.1176488139406997
the UNK - shaped specimen consist of UNK prepared pig skin and the suture which is to be tested .    2.5579084282820284
well - known mechanical properties of surgical sutures and wounds were used to UNK the precision of the experimental set - up .    3.0288297435441747
reproducible analysis of all tested sutures and wounds ( n = 120 ) was possible .    2.723816657455985
we recommend testing procedures adapted to industrial standards to obtain comparable results in determination of mechanical properties of surgical wounds and sutures .    1.996318769480195
abstract an infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) leads to a large variety of complications affecting almost every organ system .    2.378821960629746
with the increasing numbers of hiv infections , some authors have reported an occasional association between an infection with hiv and arterial aneurysm .    2.2513556645841977
however , complications affecting the vascular system demanding surgical intervention are rare .    2.2827987890823405
partial nasal obstruction in preterm and term infants increases airway resistance .    2.2082881712019518
it may reduce ventilation and cause disturbances of respiratory regulation .    2.274494270381363
although this is well established , nasogastric tubes are commonly used , because orogastric tubes are difficult to secure .    2.341263618087881
there was no preterm dislocation of an oral tube in 7 patients .    2.3446464005389798
the orogastric tube had to be reinserted once before regular change in 3 patients and only 1 UNK aged 15 weeks presented with multiple dislocations of the tube .    2.404168875739758
on the basis of a 3 days period for regular change of the orogastric tube the reliability of this new technique was 86 , 2 % for all patients and 92 , 5 % for patients below 8 weeks of age .    2.6774419294715184
mesenchymal neoplasms of UNK differentiation are the most common soft - tissue neoplasms in adults .    2.8994388505571695
in recent years a number of " new " entities and variants have been described .    2.5311987868070944
their recognition is important to avoid diagnostic pitfalls and inappropriate therapy .    2.471291251501738
chondroid lipoma , UNK , and purely cutaneous spindle - cell / pleomorphic lipoma are biologically benign neoplasms which may mimic sarcomas morphologically .    2.3171901952179157
despite high - grade morphology cutaneous liposarcomas carry a favorable clinical prognosis .    2.3548887663206357
spindle cell liposarcoma is a rare variant of atypical lipomatous tumour ( well - differentiated liposarcoma ) and must be distinguished from UNK liposarcoma with metastatic potential and benign spindle cell lipoma .    2.209064811130501
the advent of cytogenetic and molecular investigations of lipomatous neoplasms has contributed to a better understanding of the biology of these neoplasms and led to a modification of conventional classification schemes .    2.2818909355172616
the intracranial space is divided into two large compartments by the UNK .    2.732640863207619
the hydrostatic pressure of spinal fluid is responsible for UNK of the brain within these compartments .    3.082532082392468
in patients with craniectomy this equilibrium is exposed to atmospheric pressure .    2.4384863420816085
we report on four cases of reversible herniation after either bilateral or unilateral decompressive craniectomy performed for increased intracranial pressure ( icp ) and failure of conservative icp treatment .    1.8543622818627716
all four patients had survived a severe neurological disease ( encephalitis , subdural haematoma , stroke ) which required craniectomy to control raised icp .    1.9479410691916643
all were successfully weaned from the ventilator and awake and ct scans showed no space - occupying lesion anymore .    2.130393785869121
the patients showed a typical " UNK pattern " at the UNK site .    2.946454114004186
all patients developed clinical signs of transtentorial herniation ( i . e .    2.408730505333971
unilateral dilated pupils , deteriorated UNK , and extensor UNK ) shortly after either diagnostic or presumed therapeutic lumbar puncture .    2.2386323715919785
one patient developed herniation a second time while in the typical 30 ° upright position .    2.2460303179282137
after craniectomy , transtentorial herniation is possible even in the absence of increased icp .    2.6858992490028775
it is related to a negative gradient between atmospheric and intracranial pressure , which is enhanced by changes in the csf compartment following lumbar puncture .    2.6302955078726464
lumbar puncture should be avoided if possible and , when necessary , only be performed in the head - down position .    3.2450493743586075
acute therapy in these cases is quite simple ; it requires flat or even head - down positioning and early cranioplasty .    2.2505433322007833
diseases of the oral cavity , floor of the mouth , and nervous system can be accompanied by disturbances in tongue movement during swallowing .    2.3440787894766424
these disturbances can be diagnosed by videosonography whereby the examiner has to evaluate extensive video documentation of lingual motion .    2.1771939598191716
it was the aim of this study to facilitate this evaluation by the application of a reproducible computer - assisted quantitative analysis procedure .    2.6362265508916636
video sequences of 56 healthy adults and 19 patients with UNK of different etiologies were analysed .    3.054093826699305
a numerical estimation of swallowing movements was carried out in abstraction from the structures imaged ( bolus , air , muscles of the tongue , floor of the mouth , UNK , etc . ) .    2.2164127069195
intensity changes of the UNK within previously defined radial image sectors were quantified in relationship to time and depicted as sector curves .    2.458720551664905
the healthy adults demonstrated a characteristic pattern of two motion maxima that appeared within almost all sector curves .    1.9864479681235254
these maxima represented bolus transport movements and the reset movement of the tongue .    2.323607764987831
patients with diseases of the tongue or neuromuscular changes caused by disturbances of the central nervous system showed pathological deviations on videosonography .    2.589966769850727
these appeared as local or general reductions in movement , slow speed motions , repetitive swallowing or UNK additional movements of the tongue during swallowing .    2.0197853143077134
clinically - used ketamine is a racemic mixture of two isomers , s - ( + ) - and r - ( - ) - ketamine .    2.1241307429628984
previous investigations showed the anaesthetic potency of s - ( + ) - ketamine to be three times higher than that of r - ( - ) - ketamine .    2.198128234522976
it was the aim of this study to compare the effects of s - ( + ) - ketamine and racemic ketamine on endocrine and cardiovascular parameters , recovery , and side effects in geriatric patients during total intravenous anaesthesia ( tiva ) for orthopaedic surgery .    2.318098124093538
forty patients over 60 years of age scheduled for elective hip or knee replacement were investigated in a double - blind , randomised design .    2.4418130710381645
for induction of tiva , patients received 0 . 1 mg midazolam , 0 . 5 mg atropine , 1 mg / kg s ( + ) - ketamine or 2 mg / kg racemic ketamine , respectively , 2 mg vecuronium , and 1 . 5 mg / kg suxamethonium .    2.9764340910717753
after intubation and relaxation with a total dose of 0 . 1 mg / kg vecuronium , a continuous infusion of 2 mg / kg per hour s - ( + ) - or 4 mg / kg per hour racemic ketamine was administered throughout surgery .    2.4632698308587333
blood samples were taken through a central venous catheter at seven time - points , before induction as well during and after surgery , until the 1st postoperative morning for analysis of adrenaline , noradrenaline ( by high - pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection ) , anti - diuretic hormone ( adh ) , UNK hormone ( acth ) , cortisol ( by radioimmunoassay ) , glucose , and lactate .    2.0352955054227015
in addition , systolic arterial pressure ( sap ) , heart rate ( hr ) , and arterial oxygen saturation were measured , and the time intervals between the end of ketamine infusion and the return of consciousness and orientation were UNK .    2.5430476208458987
the incidence and assessment of UNK and other side effects were reported by the patients .    3.4445298105410185
UNK data of the groups were comparable , the mean age of both groups being 68 years .    3.0165046716884745
plasma adrenaline , noradrenaline , adh , acth , cortisol , and glucose as well as sap and hr increased significantly ( p < 0 . 05 ) during the course of anaesthesia .    2.52363920270489
the influence on lactate levels was not significant .    2.5740976903547304
there were no differences between s - ( + ) - and racemic ketamine with respect to these parameters .    2.491724512418874
three patients in the ketamine - racemate group showed severe arterial hypertension and were withdrawn from the study .    2.471318951506115
recovery clearly improved after administration of s - ( + ) - ketamine compared to the racemate .    2.807757366886301
simple orders were followed after 2 . 0 + / - 3 . 4 versus 4 . 9 + / - 6 . 8 min ( p = 0 . UNK ) , orientation with respect to person returned after 5 . 7 + / - 4 . 0 versus 14 . 6 + / - 10 . 0 min ( p < 0 . 001 ) and spatial orientation after 8 . 2 + / - 5 . 4 versus 17 . 4 + / - 9 . 7 min ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    2.9850361320669587
after racemic ketamine , 1 patient UNK a negative dream and 1 patient a positive dream .    2.480411791619613
in the s - ( + ) - group , 1 positive dream was reported .    2.3958388745381023
no intraoperative awareness was reported , and all patients would accept the same anaesthesia again .    2.298972303661797
increases in cardiovascular parameters and insufficient reduction of the stress response with respect to adh , acth , and cortisol seem to require a more potent hypnotic element during tiva with ketamine .    2.2300651179326447
with regard to endocrine and cardiovascular parameters , the pharmacodynamic effects of racemic and s - ( + ) - ketamine were comparable .    2.249906478640874
because of the significant improvement in recovery and the reduced quantitative drug load , s - ( + ) - ketamine offers a clinical advantage compared with currently used racemic ketamine .    2.1594404906255473
the closure of large circular defects on the scalp is technically difficult and cosmetically often not satisfying , if a free transplant is necessary .    2.048165223735453
following the technique of UNK described first in UNK , several flaps shaped like a windmill can be combined .    2.598554154973602
we report on 14 patients ( ages 41 - 88 years ) where large defects resulting from the excision of various tumors ( 5 melanomas , 5 basal cell carcinomas , 1 keratoacanthoma , 1 UNK cyst , 1 squamous cell carcinoma , 1 skin metastasis ) were successfully closed by this method .    2.08426684999165
the diameter of the defect ranged between 4 and 8 cm ( mean 5 , 7 cm ) .    2.5854128305240236
size and number of the rotating flaps ( 3 or 4 ) was varied according to the size of the defect and the mobility of the surrounding tissue .    2.761111276411131
the procedure was performed with local anesthesia in all cases .    3.289097303926882
wound healing occurred without complications except in 3 cases .    2.6424361540877768
2 patients ( 63 years , 70 years ) developed small necrotic areas on the tips of the flaps .    2.125731145238438
in a 74 year old man with a very large defect of 8 cm diameter , one flap of four underwent total necrosis .    2.2131303718440813
the cosmetic result was rated " very good " in 71 , 4 % and " good " in 14 , 3 % .    2.4459150855950282
the preservation of the terminal hair turned out to be of special advantage .    2.7251150168272407
intimal sarcoma of the pulmonary artery is an extremely rare type of malignant tumor of the large vessels .    2.8074318304910233
despite systematic diagnostics , distinguishing between pulmonary emboli and tumors is difficult .    2.1978623857735964
we report a patient who was referred because of suspected embolic occlusion of the pulmonary artery .    2.7458942361239185
the operation was started with the intention of performing a pulmonary artery UNK ; however , intraoperative histology revealed a malignant mesenchymal tumor .    2.425648111695845
therefore , the left lung was resected with the use of extracorporeal circulation , and the pulmonary trunk and right pulmonary artery were reconstructed .    3.0792830826012088
a solitary right lung metastasis was resected 3 months later using stapling devices .    2.137579160834369
complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice for patients with sarcoma of the pulmonary arteries .    3.379856951472298
surgical therapy often includes extensive reconstructive measures .    2.342900087400329
since , thromboembolic obstruction cannot be excluded preoperatively , patients with this type of disease should be treated at centers experienced with the broad spectrum of pulmonary artery surgery .    2.7212045501418722
abstract a rare cause of painful swelling of the knee cavity can be an aneurysm of the popliteal vein .    3.094678206281718
only 28 cases are reported in the literature .    2.575706021073778
we treated a 20 - year - old male patient who underwent three arthroscopies , one operation and one mri ; finally , phlebography detected a popliteal vein aneurysm and a malformation of the deep venous system of the popliteal and proximal calf veins .    2.102269293450271
to avoid the threat of pulmonary embolism a resection of the aneurysm with interposition of a venous autograft was performed .    2.664668699159878
twelve months after the operation the patient is free of symptoms with a patent autograft .    3.2202212317463004
hearing aids have fundamental disadvantages : ( 1 ) stigmatization of the patient ; ( 2 ) the sound is often found to be unsatisfactory due to the limited frequency range and undesired distortion ; ( 3 ) in many patients , the ear canal fitting device generally necessary leads to an occlusion effect ; ( 4 ) acoustic feedback when amplification is high .    2.5242438626668746
sound has the disadvantage of requiring high output sound pressure levels for its transmission .    2.251421350782726
this along with the necessary miniaturization of the loudspeaker as well as the resonances and reflections in the closed ear canal contribute to the disadvantages mentioned .    2.422874260350734
in contrast , implantable hearing aids do not make sound signals but micromechanical vibrations .    2.100864553630048
an implantable hearing aid has an electromechanical transducer instead of the loudspeaker of a conventional hearing aid .    2.321589790354294
the hearing signal does not leave the transducer as sound but as a mechanical vibration which is directly coupled to the auditory system UNK the air .    2.0082049938093505
this implantable hearing aid is either coupled to the tympanic membrane , the ossicular chain , the perilymph of the inner ear , or the skull .    2.5561293169079664
corneal cells are known to participate in the regulation of local inflammatory processes by secretion of cytokines .    2.5373344504894337
as the corneal endothelium may be exposed to endotoxin in organ culture and endotoxin is known to trigger inflammatory reactions , we investigated the effect of endotoxin from e . coli on organ cultured donor UNK with respect to autocrine and paracrine functions and the endothelial viability and density .    2.0753863614085453
for the majority of patients with sensorineural hearing loss ( snhl ) many available hearing aids often do not achieve satisfactory results .    2.3461400222736515
for these patients partially implantable hearing devices have been developed , allowing distortion - free hearing and speech intelligibility that may be superior to conventional hearing aids .    2.346976822879088
the external parts of partial implants , however , may result in a patient ' s stigmatization .    3.4140895929897774
furthermore , they do not use the acoustic properties of the external auditory canal .    2.7866830341480404
recently , we published the successful development of the first totally implantable hearing device for the treatment of snhl ( UNK 46 [ 1998 ] UNK - 863 ) .    2.5060006801710637
here we report the first implantations of this unique , totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients with snhl : UNK UNK UNK UNK .    2.959072533918353
the implant microphone is implanted subcutaneously in the outer ear canal near the ear drum .    2.087191766269631
the signal is processed by a UNK programmable multichannel UNK located subcutaneously on the bony skull behind the ear .    2.1272611782930566
a piezoelectric transducer is coupled to the body of the incus and UNK the ossicular chain by vibratory actions .    2.608838850204334
energy is provided by an implantable battery .    2.7647088584895507
speech intelligibility and the hearing of music are improved .    2.3269243824465344
patients may achieve better speech discrimination , especially in the presence of background noise .    2.9435788754054375
the aid can be used during sports , including swimming .    2.884035900091484
to our knowledge , this is the first report of the implantation of a totally implantable electronic hearing system in patients .    2.264705906385
these results encourage further implantations of the totally implantable hearing system in the course of an ongoing clinical study .    2.5737976398435385
catheter ablation by means of radiofrequency energy ( rf ) is an established method in the treatment of various forms of supraventricular and atrioventricular tachycardias .    3.09048740151739
in patients with ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) , the success of catheter ablation depends on the pathophysiological mechanism of the arrhythmia and on the underlying heart disease .    3.2318170760458824
we find out , that the two terms are very similar .    2.954652437005222
they include the keys for diagnosis and therapy .    2.7161180038011463
we propose a method to construct new coding - systems .    2.28799336895887
furthermore we report about the existing coding - systems in orthopaedics and traumatology .    2.4638312594011182
we UNK a list of national and international coding - systems .    2.5023000266556137
because of the UNK we finally give a definition of the term " UNK UNK " , which is of importance since the " 5 .    3.2876209257318796
UNK " of the " bpflv - 95 " within the classification of the " fallpauschalen " .    3.2031895080443675
" fallpauschalen " are a system like the american drg ' s ( diagnosis related groups ) , but not UNK the same .    2.4383910408323968
histology and immunohistochemistry ( demonstrating a UNK phenotype of the proliferating spindle cells and UNK of UNK present plasma cells ) of the specimen resembled previously reported lesions in various locations .    2.4153903381747432
the etiology and exact nosological classification of inflammatory UNK are not yet unequivocally UNK .    2.5051500111609495
an example of a plexiform UNK tumour ( pft ) is presented for the first time in the german - language literature .    2.621764361056545
the diagnostic criteria for this rare soft - tissue neoplasm of childhood and young adulthood , which is mostly subcutaneous in location and has a tendency to recur , include the plexiform structure which gives it its name , extensive UNK deposits and numerous UNK - like giant cells .    2.16367621701511
the development of the tumour described here , which occurred in the field of radiation of a malignant UNK excised 7 years previously , indicates the possibility of induction of pft by radiation .    2.6639113846127307
the current increase in the cost of health care must be considered as a severe threat to the prehospital emergency services system .    2.7777040942144167
two examples have been selected - the patient with polytrauma and the patient in cardiac arrest - to demonstrate the dilemma between a need for objective data and the requirements of emergency patients .    2.6775153114965313
study results obtained in trauma patients indicating that total prehospital time , including scene time , is correlated to patient outcome have led to the conclusion that at the scene treatment by emergency physicians may be UNK .    2.539002822113825
it has , however also been demonstrated that the time required for medical treatment at the scene is equivalent to 20 % of the total scene time , thus representing only a fraction of the total prehospital time .    2.8033557551949113
correlating the total prehospital time or scene time to outcome therefore appears UNK .    2.2329198529027736
the treatment principle of aggressive shock treatment in polytrauma needs critical reevaluation on the basis of results obtained by recent preclinical studies in patients with penetrating UNK injuries .    2.537920340271656
small volume resuscitation could not be demonstrated to improve outcome in polytrauma patients , although a slight improvement in patients with brain injury may be assumed .    2.7735813064780426
endotracheal intubation and early artificial ventilation are proven therapeutic principles in polytraumatized patients .    2.3127037336274485
unfortunately , for ethical reasons randomised carefully controlled comparative studies can not be performed in polytrauma patients unless the patient is fully conscious .    2.4829442078068293
the importance of endotracheal intubation and artificial ventilation in unconscious trauma patients becomes apparent under conditions of anaesthesia where the application of the endotracheal tube UNK regurgitation , aspiration and concomitant morbidity and mortality .    2.340893640515079
the common causes of cardiovascular collapse and their pathomechanisms , as well as the mechanisms of cardiopulmonary resuscitation , have been widely investigated .    2.7489008823316854
nevertheless , various aspects of their application are still controversial .    2.5494155200048305
the most recent study results have recommended initial ventilation prior to thoracic compression .    2.1116901623646798
new methods of UNK mechanical cardiopulmonary resuscitation , such as UNK cpr or UNK cpr , have shown promising results in animal experiments .    2.5264249529492697
however , the importance of results obtained by preclinical randomised controlled investigations in humans need to be confirmed by further studies as to outcome .    2.6223355095647074
the efficacy of defibrillation in cases of ventricular fibrillation has been clearly demonstrated , particularly with a view to the interval between ventricular fibrillation and defibrillation .    2.6588813404202982
it has further been demonstrated that basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation UNK ventricular fibrillation and thus improves the chance of survival .    2.1964132462889507
the present generation of defibrillators has been further improved , particularly by the introduction of biphasic defibrillator wave forms , which may reduce the required energy , as well as possible complications , while offering an increase in the efficacy of defibrillation and a reduction in defibrillator size .    2.659523330348181
scientific emergency medicine is responsible not only for the development and validation of new methods and concepts , but in particular for their application under quality control conditions .    2.40132018157022
additionally , the financial support of research in emergency medicine suffers from being UNK low priority by public research funds such as the german research fund .    2.1980376817180893
however , in view of the rapid application of experimental results to daily practice it should be emphasized that patients also support research in emergency medicine via their direct financial contributions to the health insurance companies .    2.1081053797177502
the prognosis in patients with gynecologic cancers depends not only on the stage but also on a wide spectrum of other findings .    2.71808461670657
cross - sectional imaging modalities , including sonography , ct and mri , have increasingly been used for optimal treatment planning in gynecologic cancers .    2.4431871384045984
their staging criteria are based on the well - established UNK staging system .    3.2495828383943532
ct and mri UNK with sonography , which plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of the female pelvis .    3.0989441088905165
this paper reviews the role of sonography , ct and mri in the staging of gynecologic malignancies .    2.782308640655763
it UNK the emphasis on mri , which has been established as imaging modality of choice in the preoperative evaluation of cervical and endometrial cancer , and which seems slightly superior to ct in the staging of ovarian cancer .    2.50877681071314
UNK UNK represent one group of deep UNK .    2.569500452905493
trauma , hormones and heredity have been implicated as etiologic factors .    2.2463304287957704
shoulder , chest wall , back and thigh are favored sites .    2.287565398157697
by combination of different diagnostic procedures the number of differential diagnoses can be reduced to only a few .    3.2330835083992255
while in former times surgery was thought to be the only kind of therapy , nowadays adjuvant procedures like radiation , hormonal therapy and also chemotherapy are becoming more and more important .    2.3822123974040457
amputation or other mutilating procedures should be done only if the tumor recurs repeatedly .    2.5537015184889205
UNK syndrome is an allergic reaction of antigens of UNK , known as the acute phase of schistosomiasis .    3.0309439695451177
we report on an eleven year - old boy , who was seen at our outpatient department because of cough and oedema of the face after travelling to UNK .    2.282401544531336
remarkable findings were an eosinophilia and antibodies against schistosoma - antigens .    2.2896926056559708
six weeks later the diagnosis was confirmed by detecting UNK of schistosoma haematobium in the urine .    2.5417676404444762
UNK examinations of urine and faeces four months later were negative .    2.238512019267419
there is still a significant lack of treatment and rehabilitation facilities for chronic pain patients in germany today .    2.7979501993822438
most of all the treatment of low back pain and widespread pain syndromes or UNK is time consuming and complicated .    3.0691360200184072
the main problem of anaesthesiological pain clinics is the increase of these complex pain syndromes in the last years .    2.52332167217154
the definition of chronic pain is a UNK noxious input modulated and UNK by the prolonged or recurrent nature of chronic state and further complicated by a multitude of economic and psychosocial factors .    2.572657820671999
it is now clear that no one discipline or mode will suffice .    2.0784389821904115
only a multidisciplinary and intensive UNK will prevail , as discussed in this article .    2.519307596629644
unfortunately these multidisciplinary pain units are nearly not existing in UNK just as little as control of the effectiveness of pain treatment .    2.3548251377859186
the use of somato - sensory evoked potentials ( sep ) in UNK reconstructions has been well accepted .    2.3680496106196736
however , reports about incidence and clinical significance of ischaemic sep alterations differ widely .    2.2062309225838037
in a prospective study we registered sep alterations during UNK operations done on UNK patients between 1 july 1994 , and 31 december 1996 .    2.2140770941079224
incidence , risk factors and clinical relevance were investigated .    2.862764242066485
in only 1 . 7 % of cases sep examination was inadequate .    3.193954842096066
during UNK operations sep were altered minimally or not at all .    2.1931965172835386
significant changes were UNK during 65 interventions ( 13 . 5 % ) .    2.664963042325603
the clinical outcome was poor when alteration was found during carotid dissection ( five events , three deficits ) .    2.008870817156613
cross - clamping ischaemia was the common reason for alterations ( 81 . 5 % ) ; they were generally reversible after shunting and without clinical significance .    2.428991745896934
as risk factor for cross - clamping ischaemia , only contralateral carotid occlusion was identified .    2.4273089701261727
tyrosine - rich crystalloids in tumors of the salivary glands are rare and have been reported mainly in specimens from black african patients .    2.5113426434036468
the pathogenesis of these structures is still unclear , but pathological secretion by neoplastic myoepithelial cells is supposed .    2.3033886771357714
UNK ' s staining and ultrastructural examinations are used for confirming the diagnosis .    2.520436027086598
we present the case report of a 59 - year - old woman with a UNK of the minor salivary glands in the smooth palate containing tyrosine - rich crystalloids as an example of this rare phenomenon .    2.6148165692828105
pseudoarthrosis and UNK valgus as main complications following displaced fractures of the radial condyle in children can be prevented by open reduction and fixation by k wires .    2.333610688850424
however , delayed union and stimulation of the radial UNK with condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow as well as fishtail deformities of the distal end of the humerus are reported nevertheless .    2.8259722462629355
to prevent those growth disturbances all primary and secondary ( 4 - day x - ray control ) displaced fractures of the radial condyle , i . e . those with a central gap of more than 2 mm , were prospectively treated by open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw beginning 1974 .    2.4241201530923773
sixty - six patients ( 41 boys , 25 girls ) with an average follow - up of 10 years ( 2 - 22 years ) sustained 28 primary and 6 secondary displaced fractures .    2.5284177134833277
in 5 cases a k wire fixation was performed in view of the UNK of the fragment .    3.710634252959572
two children with conservative treatment following overlooked displaced fractures showed condylar overgrowth and varisation of the elbow .    2.059524228057528
screw osteosynthesis led to symmetric elbow angles and function in all cases , whereas fishtail deformities could be observed in 8 of 27 children , probably as a consequence of the remaining central fracture instability .    2.5206639561291246
conclusion : open reduction and osteosynthesis with a metaphyseal lag screw prevents condylar overgrowth in displaced fractures of the radial condyle by UNK fracture healing in anatomic position within 3 - 4 weeks .    2.1549526497630542
however , fishtail deformity can not be prevented by metaphyseal compression only .    2.443900229483778
a commercially available c1 inhibitor ( c1 - inh ) concentrate was used for short - term prophylaxis before surgery in two patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema .    2.5386574188682807
the patients suffered from recurrent subcutaneous and submucosal oedema of the face , extremities , and gastrointestinal tract as the result of a hereditary c1 - inh deficiency .    2.3735217529948196
both patients were receiving UNK acid or UNK therapy as oral long - term prophylaxis .    2.565082319442567
over the years the patients underwent several operations in regional and general anaesthesia , with mask ventilation or intubation .    2.277224607095408
the c1 - inh plasma concentrations measured preoperatively were always very low ( 0 . 02 - 0 . 06 g / l , normal range 0 . 15 - 0 . 35 g / l ) , despite the oral long - term prophylaxis .    2.850542497215858
substitution treatment with 500 - 1000 u c1 - inh was performed 1 h before surgery .    2.282496810806646
no side effects were seen following the concentrate infusions .    2.5825657898427563
with this substitution treatment no specific symptoms of hereditary angioneurotic oedema were recognized in either case .    2.1148347446566342
the measurement of c1 - inh plasma concentration 2 h or 4 h after c1 - inh substitution showed a marked rise in both patients , though normal values were not reached in either .    2.178665394141347
we suggest that infusion of c1 concentrate is an appropriate form of preoperative substitution treatment in patients with hereditary angioneurotic oedema , in view of the lower risk of infection than with infusion of fresh - frozen plasma and the observed effectiveness .    2.420628469013687
she underwent " cox / UNK - iii - procedure " during a mitral valve reconstruction and a stable sinus rhythm was achieved .    2.283511768426699
two years after operation she has been in a stable sinus rhythm .    2.5772989092028853
transesophageal echocardiography revealed normal cardiac dimensions and function with coordinated atrioventricular contractility .    2.137913584915766
therefore the therapy with anticoagulants and UNK could be discontinued .    2.76100726252385
two cases of congenital wandering spleen with typical clinical course are reported : an 11 - year old girl had a two month history of intermittent abdominal pain predominantly after physical stress .    2.128292216166617
in upright position a palpable resistance could be identified as wandering spleen by ultrasound and UNK , and in this case splenopexy was performed .    3.0828235312128474
an otherwise healthy 3 - year old girl suffered from acute abdomen caused by torsion of an upside - down spleen with partial infarction .    2.300739931060678
diagnosis was made based on ultrasound and ct - scan .    2.600404376077014
the extent of infarction could be evaluated by color flow sonography .    2.6180917376281174
after partial resection splenopexy in orthotopic position was performed .    2.2118832628168956
discussion : in situations of intermittent abdominal pain as well as acute abdomen torsion of wandering spleen should be taken into consideration .    2.4179803902491295
UNK orthopaedic pain therapy no longer measures up to international standards .    2.173342504963188
in cases of chronic back pain , in particular , there is such a UNK between the clinical findings and the patient ' s subjective assessment that the symptoms cannot be attributed solely to so - called degenerative changes .    3.099754578785648
back pain patients are in great danger of becoming fixated on somatic symptoms due to an excess of diagnostic procedures or incorrect diagnoses , of being treated purely UNK on the basis of associated findings , and of suffering irreversible damage from invasive management of such findings .    2.2821488075568745
despite the wealth of empirical evidence , it remains difficult to expand the everyday concept of illness and its causes to include not only physical and biological factors but also social and emotional disturbances .    2.000957022009277
particularly physicians with a purely biological concept of pain have not learned to take note of affective UNK factors and incorporate them into their diagnostic assessment .    1.907977569749884
the decision to UNK invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedures then frequently represents the doctor ' s reaction to feelings of irritation or helplessness .    2.0026451613228087
if this situation is to change , an interdisciplinary concept of pain must be made a part of medical training , and scientific findings must be presented in such a way that they can be integrated into routine daily practice .    2.1512483282365653
the laboratory surveillance of measles in germany contributes to an objective estimation of the situation .    2.3608109153948837
compared to data of the pre - vaccination era , the incidence of measles has been reduced , while a shift in age towards the group of 15 - year - UNK is observed .    2.9554817583480446
germany will have considerable difficulties to reach the aim of UNK measles in the european region by the year UNK .    2.499521082391984
apart from the fact that systematic surveillance is lacking , the immunity gaps in small children represent a particularly weak spot .    2.1463248079612094
in order to effectively control measles , high vaccination rates of at least 90 % are necessary by the end of the second year of life .    2.5041500585122107
in addition , laboratory surveillance has to be included to measure successful vaccination .    2.506833069217082
main focusses are the laboratory confirmation of suspected measles cases , UNK studies of population immunity as well as the control of the circulation of measles viruses .    2.6588298723406054
we report on the activities of the national reference centre for measles , mumps and rubella since 1991 .    2.070357820335869
the german data are compared to those of selected other european countries .    2.534233251274517
the different methods that are available for the assessment and quantification of " brittle nails " and for the evaluation of various therapeutical approaches are compared .    2.8434880690539677
at this time , measurement of the swelling properties is the best documented and most reliable method for studying the treatment of brittle nails .    2.733988575233026
reliable qualitative data can also be obtained by scanning electron microscopy .    2.794409715045621
measurement of the UNK water loss and assessment of thickness and density of nails by ultrasound have also been used successfully , but the methodology still has to be improved and the reproducibility , confirmed .    2.9056113725091826
the case of a closed elbow dislocation with complete rupture of the brachial artery and its veins is described .    2.6261972761269536
this combination of injuries is rather rare and only 25 cases were found in the literature .    2.7127387865402652
the sharp lesion of the vessels was remarkable , probably due to the edge of the distally ruptured capsule .    2.6178300492084277
immediate revision with suture of the vessels and an immobilization for three weeks gave a good result .    2.1941748750705496
the management of multiple trauma patients has improved recently .    2.779898849633672
surgeons ' education , preclinical rescue structures , initial clinical survey and therapeutic strategies , as well as diagnostic imaging , have progressed .    2.4588475573663473
plain film imaging is increasingly being abandoned in favor of ct . fast imaging techniques ( spiral ct ) have led to the inclusion of ct in the primary survey .    2.5636141901435687
to minimize the risk to the patient during prolonged diagnostic time , algorithms have to be defined concerning structures , emergency room equipment and quality .    2.4393566511774627
basics , state of the art and suggestions concerning management of multiple trauma patients are presented and discussed from the radiologist ' s point of view .    2.255561604300294
the importance of hepatitis c virus infection has been recently noted in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or dilated cardiomyopathy .    2.8490966572235785
in a collaborative research project of the committees for the study of idiopathic cardiomyopathy , hepatitis c virus antibody was found in 74 of 697 patients ( 10 . 65 ) with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in 42 of UNK patients ( 6 . 3 % ) with dilated cardiomyopathy ; these UNK were significantly higher than that found in UNK blood donors in UNK .    2.4707980949678516
hepatitis c virus antibody was detected in 650 of 11 , UNK patients ( 5 . 4 % ) seeking care in 5 academic hospitals .    2.864939509410664
various cardiac abnormalities were found , and arrhythmias were the most frequent .    2.9349418093990196
these observations suggest that hepatitis c virus infection is an important cause of a variety of otherwise unexplained heart diseases .    2.694881114327827
transdifferentiated retinal pigment epithelial cells ( rpe ) display enhanced contractile potentials and have been implicated in the development of tractional retinal detachment .    2.3519803776319392
this study determines the activity of contraction - promoting factors , examines some involved mechanisms and evaluates inhibitors .    2.025401482680495
using an in vitro UNK , we demonstrated that collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated rpe cells is effectively stimulated by serum , platelet - derived growth factor and insulin - like growth factor - 1 .    2.2379275195813206
endothelin - 1 and transforming growth factor - 1 and - 2 have a more discrete or marginal effect .    2.707878935935642
tractional forces promoted by these peptides are completely protein synthesis dependent .    2.1416802166683415
contraction stimulated by serum is only partly dependent on de novo protein synthesis , suggesting different active factors and / or pathways .    2.224079459979525
UNK , a broad - spectrum kinase inhibitor , effectively inhibited collagen matrix contraction by transdifferentiated rpe cells regardless of the promoter .    2.1040181911962805
revascularization in cases of recurrent occlusions following aorto - iliac vascular reconstructions , particular in high - risk patients , poses a therapeutic dilemma .    2.3883622243249594
we report the case of a 78 - year - old female patient who presented - after multiple vascular reconstructions of iliac and femoral arteries - with UNK syndrome , resulting critical limb ischemia and concomitant coronary and lung disease .    2.0848297980640216
the preoperative angiography of the supraaortic branches revealed a high - grade stenosis of the right subclavian artery in the presence of a previously implanted carotid - subclavian bypass on the left .    2.7935899150043673
this stenosis was dilated and then UNK by way of the proximal end of the axillo - bifemoral graft , which in turn was distally UNK to the right popliteal and left deep femoral artery .    2.4510252046754615
postoperative angiography verified a good run - off and satisfactory vascular status was obtained .    2.1879299740206126
duplex sonography 6 months after surgery showed a good flow and the patient was free of symptoms .    3.178157982180724
these results demonstrate that , combined with intraoperative stent application , an axillo - bifemoral graft can be implanted with good results .    2.347397668394571
a follow - up study was carried out on premature - born children from UNK and UNK at pre - school and early school age in order to investigate the long - term somatic development of these children .    2.9707223365434006
anthropological parameters were examined and compared with the data of a reference group .    3.1199486302968165
mediastinitis caused by infection with clostridium UNK and spontaneous rupture of the esophagus are both life threatening conditions .    2.47152924708228
the combination of these two entities led to septic multiorgan failure in a 38 - year - old woman .    2.3852336447511955
the patient was treated successfully by esophagectomy and postoperative lavage through a partially open abdomen .    2.1928247398663228
the lack of information regarding emesis , the leading symptom of UNK ' s syndrome , caused delayed diagnosis : the triad of emesis , severe epigastric pain and emphysema of the skin was not established until 30 h after the onset of symptoms .    2.35516666006564
for ethical and socio - economical reasons ( cost - explosion in transfusion - medicine , patient ' s individual destiny ) , UNK and consistent application of allogeneic transfusion sparing techniques in surgery is a UNK - UNK to anesthesiologists , surgeons and blood - UNK .    2.6273346524679293
the combination of different techniques , i . e .    2.563440874411785
autologous UNK , hemodilution , choice of anesthetic regimen , deliberate hypotension , application of anti - fibrinolytic agents and autotransfusion of intraoperatively saved blood allow for avoidance of allogeneic blood transfusion even in patients presenting important intraoperative hemorrhage .    1.9611247838018449
introduction : if the surgeon cannot find the tendon of the superior oblique muscle in the right place , he has to change his operative plans intraoperatively .    2.1490733713056263
different procedures are recommended : reinsertion of the superior oblique in the right place , UNK of the inferior oblique muscle , and operations on the vertical muscles of the same or the UNK eye .    2.9409908752435006
in 180 children ( 87 children belonging to a control group , 68 with fever of non - renal origin , and 25 with pyelonephritis ) albumin and immunoglobulin g ( markers for glomerular dysfunction ) , - 1 - microglobulin and - nag ( markers for proximal tubular dysfunction ) and UNK a1 ( marker of ' postrenal ' dysfunction ) were measured in second - voided morning urine .    2.094163493764966
in children with fever of non - renal origin , glomerular dysfunction was encountered in 8 . 8 % , tubular dysfunction in 17 . 6 % and mixed glomerular - tubular dysfunction in 14 . 7 % of cases .    2.6824500931181863
among children with pyelonephritis , 28 % revealed glomerular dysfunction and 44 % mixed glomerular - tubular dysfunction .    2.0759674523746563
no case of solitary proximal tubular dysfunction was observed in children with pyelonephritis .    3.4458150916547945
there were highly significant differences in presence and expression of glomerular dysfunction between children with fever of non - renal origin and children with pyelonephritis ( p < 0 . 0001 ) , whereas with regard to proximal tubular dysfunction , the differences were only moderately significant ( - nag : p < 0 . 01 ) or of low significance ( - 1 - microglobulin : p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.271370341768611
this may indicate that morphologic changes occur during interstitial pyelonephritis due to inflammation of UNK , resulting in glomerular dysfunction , while proximal tubular dysfunction may additionally be due to fever - associated function processes .    2.2531481796494464
up to the middle of the UNK , chemotherapy had only a marginal role in the overall treatment concept for cervical carcinoma , and surgery and radiotherapy are still the cornerstones of treatment today .    2.873088998469228
there are indications for chemotherapy , which can theoretically be used as follows :    2.976050503051465
we compared a cw carbon dioxide flash - scanning laser system to an er : yag laser in laser skin resurfacing of facial UNK .    1.9566592788529191
a separation of the individual latex layers is a known complication of endotracheal UNK tubes manufactured by immersion technique .    2.2522973400673556
this can result in herniation into the lumen with obstruction of the tube .    2.5867922206201905
diffusion of nitrous oxide into the inner hernia considerably UNK the obstruction .    2.147043884707698
this can lead to life - threatening situations .    3.1692142721278236
we observed a similar herniation caused by layer separation with subsequent tube obstruction of UNK anaesthesia tubes used in paediatric circuit systems .    1.9349317896820948
this is caused by UNK defects and above all by damage UNK in UNK .    2.822721266609631
therefore it is important to process the tubes carefully .    2.4898900225994343
a too - high drying temperature can cause premature layer separation .    2.133807405015589
the tubes should never be processed more than 80 times .    2.2895322459440948
routine examination of the tubes is imperative , especially at the predilection sites for layer separation .    2.4354342593276783
severe aortic valve disease is a rare complication of coarctation in adults .    3.3492530448718187
between 1961 and 1990 aortic valve replacement was performed after or combined with the operation of coarctation in 24 adults ( 4 % of entire population operated for coarctation ) .    2.468437563290991
UNK aortic valves were present in 2 / 3 of patients .    2.746404487651982
in 10 patients ( 710 with aortic stenosis ) coarctation was operated early ( mean age 24 years ) and aortic valve late ( mean age 40 years ) : in 14 ( UNK with aortic regurgitation , mean age 40 years ) aortic valve and coarctation were operated simultaneously ( 8 patients ) or staged within 6 months ( 6 patients ) .    2.2768835144310104
additional surgical interventions on the dilated aorta UNK were performed in 8 , mitral valve replacement in 2 and aorto - coronary bypass in 1 patients .    2.2453033357786594
early mortality was 224 ( 8 % ) and was similar in simultaneously ( 18 ) and staged ( 114 ) operated cases : 10 year survival was lower than in an age - matched group of 72 patients with aortic valve disease of similar severity operated during the same period ( 70 % vs 88 % , p < 0 . 01 ) : 67 late deaths were cardia ; 55 pts with preoperatively severely increased end - diastolic ( > 199 mlm2 ) and 44 with end - systolic ( > 90 mlm2 ) left ventricular volumes and 22 with ejection fraction < 41 % died late postoperatively .    1.988203360281629
abstract 13 experienced addiction therapists UNK - UNK information about trauma experiences and comorbidity of 122 clients ( 26 women and 96 men ) with opiate addiction and multiple substance abuse .    2.0554610642332083
42 % had had at least one traumatic life experience and the women had higher percentages than men .    2.3696215910117573
the UNK UNK took place during childhood and prior to the begin of drug consumption .    2.633853682271142
26 % of the trauma victims were diagnosed as having post - traumatic stress disorder .    3.3151708717321724
in comparison with individuals without trauma experiences , victims UNK significantly more comorbid symptoms , they more frequently suffered from UNK and had more experiences with psychotherapy .    2.079545201794888
nearly all drugs currently used during the course of general anaesthesia may lead to hypersensitivity reactions of various types .    2.9028269033140064
there may be an acute type i allergic reactions or to a more or less severe pseudoallergic reactions , in rare cases with lethal outcome .    2.3875507093462667
routine preoperative testing appears of little predictive value , in spite of the high frequency of so - called risk factors ( atopy , other kind of allergy ) among the evaluated group of patients .    2.3129095668184494
careful UNK testing should be performed 4 to 6 weeks after any incidents of suspected drug intolerance , in order to discover the underlying causative agent .    2.514499783504678
skin testing is of diagnostic value for neuromuscular blockers and intravenous narcotics .    2.378650033157776
rast - and ria - tests and / or mediator releasing tests may also used additionally .    2.378853932882262
together with all other administered drugs , all the routinely used neuromuscular blockers ( suxamethonium , vecuronium , pancuronium , UNK , atracurium , mivacurium ) should be tested , since they often represent the cause for such reactions .    2.2290533340004477
for other classes of drugs ( for example , volatile anesthetics and opioids ) the clinical relevance of skin testing still remains uncertain .    2.2965842803242142
for less severe incidents seen during general anaesthesia such as pruritus , or exanthems , skin testing seems to be less relevant .    2.2565909979455587
nociception is a protective system of the body which prevents it from injury and tissue damage .    2.4814249991661237
human beings respond to noxious stimuli by moving away .    2.374173933935269
they learn by pain to avoid these situations in future .    2.4118115006304244
shortly after major injury , there is a limited analgesic period allowing the body to flee the area of danger , later on , emerging pain UNK the body to rest and supports UNK .    2.316844584406536
while acute pain has a certain meaning , chronic pain does not .    2.342696888830827
it induces a comprehensive suffering including loss of initiative , appetite and vigilance .    2.0342767253604004
it reduces life - quality , often accompanied by depressive UNK .    2.3699985913629895
acute pain causes changes in the central nervous system leading to an increased sensitivity of nociception ( hyperalgesia ) .    2.7134177804803388
during healing , the central processing of noxious stimuli is normalised taking minutes to weeks .    2.1340847358701294
sometimes , unknown factors initiate chronification of pain .    2.2480191088581223
changes on a molecular level in peripheral tissue as well as in the central nervous system induce " cellular early genes " [ 24 ] , a synthesis of c - fos , c - jun and other proteins favouring the chronification of pain .    2.178770241576157
all efforts have to be made to depress or interrupt such a development .    2.646566542564496
one of the first steps to pain prophylaxis in a hospital is an optimal surgical technique : incision , extension , limited tissue damage and minimal invasive surgery should guarantee the smallest impairment of the nociceptive system possible .    2.157023755672536
however , nociceptive input is intense and of long duration and leads to central UNK .    2.184546216659397
postoperative pain has lost its function as surgery anticipates healing .    2.3311710821278644
pain induces a reduction of ventilation , circulation , digestion and increases the risk of other disorders .    2.708599476189074
there is need of aggressive pain treatment for UNK reasons and for reasons of late sequelae like permanent pain and increased reduction of function [ 10 ] .    2.0373216291164473
this is of pivotal importance in patients with amputations or sympathetic reflex dystrophy ( UNK ) .    2.618927352978618
antinociception is best provided by regional anaesthesia technique with a combination of local anaesthetics and opioids which results in better outcome [ 2 , 12 ] .    2.4467784912143413
hence , regional anaesthesia techniques are strongly indicated in those patients .    2.4883995925696585
good antinociception may be even more important than it is assumed today .    2.3705492466510494
UNK [ 1 ] demonstrated a lower morbidity and mortality in 45 newborns undergoing cardiothoracic surgery , when general anaesthesia was performed with high - dose sufentanil versus halothane supplementary doses of morphine .    2.4343119265391446
anaesthesiologists have to reconsider the quality of general anaesthesia : the antinociception of their regimen .    2.6005822719797793
in diagnostics of erectile dysfunction there are different simple or large - scale procedures available .    2.286912701240517
refering to a three - step - scheme that makes difference in the diagnostics in i . non - invasive , ii .    2.504065025551666
invasive procedures the current diagnostic measures will be explained .    2.603712453271413
to the non - invasive measures do account the extensive patients history taking including the sexual history and the psychological diagnostics , the physical examination and laboratory UNK .    2.2559796304053052
the semi - invasive procedures include the intracavernous injection test with UNK substances , the doppler sonography and duplex or color duplex sonography , the corpus - cavernosum - UNK ( cc - emg ) and other neurophysiological examinations .    2.1277851847131384
the third invasive step contains the dynamic infusion pharmacological UNK and UNK ( UNK ) and the selective pharmacological UNK - arteriography .    2.9695922245177524
the procedures of this step are essentially limited to patients with erectile dysfunction who are planned for surgical interventions .    2.229594617384754
technological advances in the last two years in mammalian nuclear transfer techniques and the establishment of human embryonic stem cell lines formed the background of the international workshop on " embryonic stem cells and nuclear transfer strategies " organized at the gene center , munich , september 1999 .    2.174426720699009
the aim of the meeting was to bring together scientists working in the stem cell field and those working on somatic nuclear transfer techniques to discuss the present status and UNK of both technologies for basic and applied research and future use in medicine and UNK breeding .    2.0199483800894544
" biology of embryonic stem cells " , " nuclear transfer strategies " , and " stem cell differentiation - cell therapy " were the main topics of the meeting .    2.360652573736175
it became clear that we are far from understanding the processes involved in stem cell self - UNK and differentiation and the mechanisms resulting in reprogramming of nuclei from somatic cells after transfer into enucleated oocytes .    2.08389725746482
however , data were presented that showed the enormous potential of the embryonic stem cell technology for tissue transplantation in the future .    2.2288999857662057
before any use of this technology in combination with any cloning technology for human cell therapy will be possible , further research including animal models and stem cell differentiation approaches in culture ( i . e . , identification of differentiation factors , selective differentiation strategies , UNK gene assays ) is necessary to understand the basic principles of pluripotent stem cell differentiation and the mechanisms involved in reprogramming somatic cell nuclei .    2.1766431542152174
certain fractures and / or dislocations of the femoral head are known to cause arterial injury and result in post - traumatic osteonecrosis .    3.12877685934519
however , the more complex etiology of non - traumatic osteonecrosis is multifactorial and includes chemotherapy , radiotherapy , thermal injuries , and especially coagulopathies , which are now commonly observed in these patients .    2.4890546089918675
intravascular coagulation with fibrin thrombosis begins in the capillaries and sinusoids of the intraosseous microcirculation , and residual venous thrombosis is more likely to occur if there is coexistent UNK .    2.042380492562595
the aim of our study was to investigate the influence that serum of patients with preeclampsia has on t - pa and pai - 1 expression from human endothelial cells .    2.259657724395745
for this purpose , we cultured human endothelium cells , gained from umbilical veins , for 24 h with sera of 7 patients with hellp syndrome and 12 patients with preeclampsia .    2.225190938530887
the sera of 12 normotensive pregnant patients and 9 non - pregnant women were used as controls .    2.2021556752682656
we then determined t - pa and pai - 1 levels by elisa , both in the maternal serum and in the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures .    2.2528218784496
the supernatant of the endothelial cell cultures demonstrated significantly elevated levels of both t - pa ( p < 0 . 001 ) and pai - 1 ( p < 0 . 01 ) when stimulated with serum gained from patients with preeclampsia or hellp syndrome .    2.287279018123862
the increased expression of t - pa and pai - 1 from human endothelium cells after stimulation with the serum of preeclamptic patients must be considered as a sign of increased endothelial cell activation .    2.3060301949324136
postoperative pain relief can be achieved by several methods , including the use of systemic opioids and regional anaesthesia with intrathecal or epidural opioids or local anaesthetics .    2.6657303322547463
on - demand analgesia using a pca ( patient - controlled analgesia ) system is regarded as the ideal option for systemic opioid analgesia .    2.2337340298093378
while pca devices are not yet commonly used in all recovery units , the use of repetitive boluses on demand is still the most frequent form of administration in postoperative pain therapy .    2.596182562960609
the objective of the present study was to show if continuous infusion of the opioid tramadol could produce better analgesia than repetitive administration of boluses .    2.3339869757984806
in a study under double - blind conditions 135 asa i and ii patients were assigned at random to group i ( infusion group ) or group b ( bolus group ) when they first requested pain treatment after abdominal surgery .    2.1352603341631142
the patients in group i received an initial intravenous loading dose of 100 mg tramadol , followed by an infusion of 12 mg / h tramadol for 24 h ; if necessary , repeated boluses of 50 mg tramadol were given .    2.338063561297471
in group b the patients received a placebo infusion instead of the tramadol infusion ; otherwise , the procedure was the same .    2.640366891077437
pain relief was monitored by means of a vas ( visual analogue scale ) up to 6 h after surgery .    2.745275720277583
we investigated the retrograde assessment of analgesia by the patients after 6 h , how often repetitive boluses were required , and the amount of analgesics administered in 6 and 24 h . results .    2.6022831383708596
the pain relief was assessed as excellent or good by 76 . 5 % of group i and 65 . 6 % of group b ; 19 . 1 % of group i and 26 . 9 % of group b assessed the analgesic effect as satisfactory ; 4 . 4 % of group i and 7 . 5 % of group b complained of insufficient analgesia .    2.8955323225909577
in group i 69 . 2 % requested only one or no repetitive bolus , compared with 40 . 3 % in group b , while two or more boluses were demanded by 30 . 8 % in group i and 59 . 7 % in group b .    2.9132465461725077
the average analgesic consumption after 6 h was UNK . 5 + / - 53 . 7 mg tramadol in group i and 176 . 6 + / - 63 . 1 mg tramadol in group b , respectively .    2.8882107519687246
while the consumption during the first 6 h was comparable , from then on the consumption in group i increased significantly .    2.6860282502606743
side effects were reported by 25 % in both groups .    2.9440179794500465
they were clinically UNK and did not necessitate termination of the clinical trial in any case .    2.8812192230564193
during the study period pulse and blood pressure remained within the normal range and did not show any significant changes .    2.4563035697582816
the fact that the patients in group i requested far fewer repetitive boluses than those in group b and the assessment by the patients led to the conclusion that treatment in the infusion group is better than that in the bolus group .    2.872865370845777
concerns that a significantly higher consumption of analgesics would cause unwanted side - effects have proven UNK .    2.4639459990526285
six hours after surgery , when analgesia was evaluated by the patients , there was no significant difference between the two groups .    3.096282975444442
not until the maintenance infusion had been administered for a further 18 h , was the tramadol consumption within the infusion group significantly higher .    2.225758951290899
thus , we should consider continuing UNK administration of the maintenance infusion 6 h after operation .    2.4175322961990244
the concept of tuberculid was introduced by UNK in 1896 .    2.7036093461582302
in contrast to " true " cutaneous tuberculosis , properties of the tuberculids were explained by an UNK response to UNK or their fragments released from a different site of manifest or passed tuberculous infection .    2.2123819235102755
key features include a strongly positive UNK skin test , evidence of concomitant manifest or past tuberculosis , and prompt response to antituberculous therapy the inability to culture m . tuberculosis or to demonstrate it microscopically from lesional biopsies , together with reports on tuberculid - like eruptions after bcg vaccination , supports this concept .    1.7510528902902212
clinical manifestations are lichen UNK , papulo - necrotic tuberculids and erythema UNK of UNK .    2.2997243753739327
the existence of tuberculids has been questioned , however , because the clinical and histological appearances are not always specific .    3.4390984410684293
an increasing number of case reports on tuberculids , new immunological tests and molecular biology - based techniques for the detection of mycobacteria have shed new light on the tuberculid concept .    2.2617827001122426
case report : a 20 - year - old female patient was admitted to the hospital because of a pneumothorax .    3.1509607103910087
a secondary amenorrhea was coexisting .    2.594851764313622
on the abdominal wall and in the anogenital area a maculopapular exanthema was visible .    2.568017907207905
chest x - ray and hr - ct showed a interstitial lung disease with high probability of histiocytosis x which was confirmed by biopsies of lung and skin tissue .    2.3321658877915246
the cause of amenorrhea was a histiocytic infiltration of the pituitary UNK .    2.5442339710400543
conventional " consensus - treatment " for adults with vinblastine , prednisone and etoposide did not prevent relapsing bilateral pneumothoraces .    1.8868977467005295
treatment was successful with the protocol as proposed by the international study for children .    2.4430138880720595
this treatment is characterized by higher dosage and combination with 6 - UNK .    3.0453147057170047
the prognosis of patients with malignant diseases requiring treatment on intensive care units is poor .    2.9473664841262
the hospital mortality for mechanically ventilated patients ranges from 70 - 90 % in patients with solid tumors to 75 - 90 % in patients with hematological malignancy and up to 95 % in patients after bone marrow transplantation .    2.793064611820801
the number of patients referred to intensive care units is however increasing , due to improvements in the general treatment of malignant diseases .    2.5997080385134823
this results in controversies about the utilization of intensive care treatment in these patients .    2.5497471807130814
since the individual outcome can not be predicted prior to initiation of intensive care therapy a general refusal of intensive care treatment seems not justified .    2.3955453066769268
a reevaluation of the patients status after initiation of intensive care treatment based on predefined criteria may however be useful in the decision about continuing intensive care measures .    2.6685848060158435
patients requiring mechanical ventilation after bone marrow transplantation will not survive if prolonged treatment with UNK is necessary and / or sustained hepatic and renal failure is present .    2.4910738583860925
for these patients a withdrawal of further life support may be considered .    2.5155732115616893
intensive care treatment should be continued in patients not fulfilling these criteria and treatment results are comparable to those in patients without malignant diseases .    2.6482164996637425
for other patients with malignant diseases the use of a new score system developed for patients with cancer can be helpful in the clinical decision making .    3.3278488199689544
on the basis of a solution - oriented UNK therapy , the different within - session effects of four different types of questions in systemic therapy ( lineal , strategic , circular , and reflexive ) , as described by UNK ( 1989 ) , were tested .    2.225694598085498
lineal and strategic questions were expected to have a stabilizing and UNK effect on the system ( i . e .    2.5437188283429726
the client , the clients ' interaction , and the therapeutic interaction ) , whereas circular and reflexive questions were expected to open the system for change .    2.5159295890142825
interestingly this hypothesis was only supported for the wife , who had the role of the identified client in the therapy and demonstrated a much stronger motivation for change .    2.3791496511453945
for the husband , who preferred the role of a UNK and demonstrated only little motivation for change , results were not as predicted .    2.682944550483498
some of his reactions were even opposite to the expected therapeutic effects .    2.3590653992889927
therefore , it is suggested that an interaction effect between questions and the motivation for change can be assumed .    2.4815917541056876
prerequisites for experimental study designs are extremely difficult to UNK under prehospital emergency conditions .    2.2322150681198445
results obtained in animal experiments always need validation with prehospital or UNK patient studies .    2.3443846456479247
investigations related to emergency medicine are , however , an ethical obligation on behalf of the patient .    2.693956143033331
a retrospective analysis of the available literature should be considered a prerequisite for prospective randomised and controlled studies .    3.4437488727159185
frequently , a pilot study or feasibility trial needs to precede the actual study .    2.2260699398988653
informed consent must be obtained for all patient studies .    2.380812321627309
however , under emergency conditions informed consent cannot always be obtained due to unconsciousness , etc .    2.1386520197500167
nevertheless , the following principles should be observed : ( a ) randomised studies are essential , even in emergency medicine ; ( b ) they are ethically acceptable if the treatment provided for the study group is at least equivalent to the therapy for the control group ; ( c ) only these preconditions guarantee that the patient always receives treatment in accordance with the standard of treatment .    2.5026442409557794
if the patient is unconscious or otherwise unable to give informed consent , the principle of deferred consent is acceptable .    2.2306566086744595
a prospective randomized study represents the gold standard for an investigation , even under emergency conditions .    2.490927778892042
there are different principles of UNK : telephone or UNK UNK , etc .    3.060387710085151
emergency medicine investigations need to be completed within a reasonable time frame which should , as a rule , not exceed 2 years .    2.38148243269374
otherwise , too many items might change without being noted .    2.1948603683044188
curative treatment and the intention to treat are terms employed by ethics committees .    2.428652593826007
if an investigation does not bear in itself additional risk factors , it does not necessarily have to be brought before the ethics committee .    2.5478957529405624
if , however , for example , the effect of obtaining blood samples is investigated separately for research purposes , the patient needs to be informed and sign the respective agreement .    2.8473144351981863
in germany the ethics committees have agreed to accept their respective decisions .    2.2071496441017704
for multicentre and UNK studies , however , the ethics committees also need to accept decisions made by non - german ethics committees .    2.523942948878137
not all therapeutic principles can serve as the basis of prospective randomized studies because they need to be considered the present standard of care ( e . g . , endotracheal intubation , etc . ) .    2.8081028740236937
nevertheless , the feasibility of a study should be assessed according to the 1 - 3 rating proposed by the american heart association .    2.833891627797843
in principle , the overall emergency physician protocol does not fulfill scientific requirements .    2.2035919684351497
for all studies , particularly in the prehospital setting , an independent observer should be involved for documentation purposes .    2.3334972967208896
scores can be of importance for investigating different treatment regimens .    2.446059215447308
UNK in emergency medicine studies focus on the variability of ems , personnel qualifications , etc .    2.5023045625125473
this is in part why it is extremely difficult to prove efficacy and efficiency in emergency medicine .    2.2894067280490606
new antifungals for oral therapy have improved the chances of healing UNK .    2.295466585816534
nevertheless , in daily practice the failure rate is 20 - 30 % both with itraconazole and terbinafine .    2.386207459943355
in our investigations for the UNK effects of terbinafine , we could show that the same strain of trichophyton UNK or t . UNK in the rest period needs 1000 times higher concentration of terbinafine ( 2 , 0 to 0 , 002 µg / ml ) for complete fungal killing as in the growth phase .    2.4234385682643977
thus resting fungi in the nail are not UNK , and if the concentration of terbinafine is lower than the mic for the fungi , they can cause a relapse .    2.664219173239965
itraconazole is a UNK agent .    3.608772756367444
its concentration in the nail plate must be higher than the mic for the causative fungi for a long time - 10 to 12 months .    2.5072207418126182
the usual short - term treatment of UNK over 3 months can be insufficient in individual cases such as patients with disorders , e . g .    2.5192111248786366
circulatory disorders or slowed nail growth .    2.51999391054592
this paper presents an algorithm for automatic switching between atrial tracking and nontracking pacing mode based on a " 4 out of 7 " concept : if 4 out of 7 atrial intervals are sensed below a critical value , mode switching ( ms ) is automatically performed .    1.9341315217807022
the technical solution in medtronic kappa 700 dual chamber devices is explained together with an evaluation of advantages and possible limitations .    2.0203795557526356
the " 4 out of 7 " algorithm offers a quick ms ; by the addition of a " UNK flutter search " algorithm integrated into this concept , the detection of atrial flutter is facilitated in a wider range of programmed av intervals .    2.0711560205294877
with the increased rapidity of ms and sensitivity towards atrial flutter detection , there is also an increased propensity to switch to the nontracking mode in case of short atrial runs and frequent premature atrial beats .    2.2158801120004923
therefore , to optimize the ms function , programming of the device ( e . g . , activation of a time delay before ms ) should be carried out individually with respect to the intrinsic rhythm and arrhythmia of the patient .    2.3847569544440845
possible interactions between different programmable parameters should also be taken into consideration .    2.284622060520254
some guidelines are presented in this paper .    2.957804055591604
finally , the use of extended stored diagnostic data seems to be crucial to evaluate pacemaker performance , incidence of atrial arrhythmias , and ( as far as possible ) confirmation of the stored data themselves by assessment of stored intracardiac UNK .    2.3141436408183247
between 1983 and 1991 ten patients with chronic frontal sinus disease underwent frontal osteoplastic flaps with fat obliteration .    2.309113472533295
in order to judge operative success on a long - term basis all patients were called for postoperative follow - up .    2.6482029366899438
they then completed a questionaire , in which they were asked about postoperative complaints .    2.517357059959796
additionally , sinuses were examined by computed tomographic ( ct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mr ) .    2.434367852667886
among the patients evaluated seven had no complaints , and no evidence of disease could be found by medical examination .    2.824913681205172
ct scans showed complete obliteration of the frontal sinuses in all patients .    2.708709638766432
mr was used in an attempt to show evidence for suppurative disease in the frontal sinus , but the mr images failed to correlate with symptoms .    2.7295453052842493
additional results could not be obtained when compared to ct .    3.2402777211738645
overall operating success could only be determined by clinical assessment and confirmed the value of the frontal osteoplastic flap with fat obliteration .    2.666031610049156
the objective of our trial was to evaluate the significance and usefulness of sentinel lymphadenectomy ( slne ) for the staging of regional lymph nodes in breast cancer patients .    2.4933916633472366
the study presented illustrates the method and our results .    2.5239681165100727
as has been UNK for melanoma , the first lymph node [ sentinel node ( sln ) ] to receive lymphatic drainage from a primary tumor is the expected first site of lymph - node metastasis .    2.271102474402223
the database presented includes 12 patients with operable breast cancer and clinically negative lymph nodes .    2.2641104489174237
in 11 cases the described method was applicable .    2.5384710349030253
in only one case was there no correlation between the histology of the sln and the axillary specimen .    2.4590284964279974
background : information on the extent and degree of the thermal effect produced is of great importance for control of the laser dosage in laser UNK ( ltk ) and for postoperative follow - up .    2.448098355607125
we investigated on acute ltk effects which information images obtained by optical low UNK tomography ( oct ) offer compared to those obtained by polarization microscopy .    1.9676800840347306
in cases with protected left main stenosis by previous bypass surgery or as an emergency intervention in patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction and cardiogenic shock , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty is performed as an alternative treatment strategy to bypass surgery .    2.4926662993862068
a review of 262 left main UNK revealed a procedure - related mortality in cases without protection of the left main coronary artery of 9 . 1 % ( 4 / 44 ) , in cases with partially protected left main stenosis by collaterals to either left coronary artery of 4 . 8 % ( 1 / 21 ) and 0 . 5 % ( 1 / 187 ) in cases with UNK bypass grafts to either left coronary artery .    2.7325436795894458
the risk stratification of the procedure can be evaluated by the proposed grading of left main artery protection .    2.7845935439208858
hypocalcemia is a relatively uncommon reversible cause of congestive heart failure .    2.338041024855894
there are a few reports of UNK children who developed congestive heart failure associated with hypoparathyroidism .    2.595880682287833
in all these patients , however , cardiac failure did not occur before the age of nine years .    3.272383421785183
in addition , other striking noncardial manifestations of hypoparathyroidism , e . g . , convulsive seizures , had been present prior to cardiac symptoms .    2.118531603549452
in this publication , nager syndrome was analyzed in the literature and six patients from our clinic were evaluated in relation to symptoms , etiology and pathogenesis .    2.6586426278866258
the diseases to be considered when making a differential UNK are pointed out .    2.6552898211317366
clarification of the etiology is still pending .    2.889086108638479
molecular genetic research in these patients is possibly the key for new findings .    2.6353188964357974
a case report illustrates the results of interdisciplinary treatment by the surgeon and orthodontist .    3.0572524872506333
possibilities and problems in relation to therapy are demonstrated .    3.003236143723805
the results of ankle arthroplasty have generally been disappointing compared to other forms of arthroplasty .    2.3688967621966683
the present survey of results of ankle arthroplasty deals with the anatomical , the UNK the biomechanical and the biological features of the ankle joint .    2.715226817107844
these features all seem important prerequisites for a successful total ankle prosthesis design .    2.2511814893229665
from the study of the results displayed in the literature and those of my own series it can be stated that a modern ankle arthroplasty should respect the normal anatomy and UNK .    2.58526818556046
biomechanically it should work as a normal ankle joint i . e . cylindrical mobility , UNK and a possibility for normal torque within the ankle UNK .    2.539564624453673
the prosthesis components should only be fixed in solid subchondral bone , and preferably without cement .    2.302198550651377
only UNK forces should act at the bone - prosthesis interface .    2.365576211957581
the axis of the ankle joint as well as of that of the hindfoot should be aligned to normal .    3.409707375612604
meticulous surgery and special guide instruments are absolute necessities .    2.3222012068129305
restoration of muscle power and gait postoperatively are essential for a good and lasting result .    2.3609505124180243
the indication for ankle arthroplasty is mainly cases of osteoarthritis ( primary or traumatic ) and rheumatoid arthritis .    2.217045039298242
contraindications are talus necrosis , charcot joints , extreme osteoporosis , severe arteriosclerosis , and very aggressive arthritis .    1.9609100931659662
mental disorders and neurological disorders may also be contraindications .    2.848887115067874
furthermore , the patients should agree not to perform sports involving jumping and running or other ankle demanding activities .    2.1301464602130507
the average annual failure rate should not exceed 1 % if these recommendations are followed .    2.143716939210296
elbow flexion plays a key role in the overall function of the upper extremity .    3.2970329330053567
in the case of unilateral complete brachial plexus lesion , restoration of elbow flexion will dramatically increase the patient ' s chances of regaining UNK UNK .    2.185303497395909
furthermore , depending on the type of reconstruction , stability of the glenohumeral joint as well as some supination function of the forearm can be restored to a varying degree at the same time .    2.7629927952469604
depending on the level of brachial plexus lesion and / or reinnervation , different reconstructive procedures are available .    2.759149575403289
in order to select the best treatment option for the patient it is necessary to known the extent of the lesion of the brachial plexus and / or ventral upper arm muscles , to time the operation appropriately , to be aware of all treatment possibilities and to recall the special problems of tendon transfer for brachial plexus patients .    2.5078711208989013
our concept is based on our experience with more than 1100 patients presenting a brachial plexus lesion between 1981 and 1996 and treated in our institution .    2.6935500674236477
there were 528 operative revisions of the brachial plexus .    2.407293178982092
some 225 patients underwent secondary muscle / tendon transfers .    2.2726458386763384
in 35 patients elbow flexion was reconstructed by bipolar latissimus dorsi transfer ( n = 10 ) , triceps - to - biceps transfer ( n = 15 ) , modified flexor / pronator muscle mass UNK ( n = 6 ) and multiple - stage free functional muscle transfer after UNK nerve transfer ( n = 4 ) .    2.3743280716555213
the official german guidelines for prevention of intravascular - device - associated infections were published by the bundesgesundheitsamt , now called the robert - koch - institut , 12 years ago .    1.7944849694359297
the recently published official " guidelines for prevention of intravascular - device associated infections " of the centers for disease control and prevention ( cdc ) are categorized according to scientific evidence .    1.7874354566474588
the american guidelines are very detailed and differ in some aspects from the UNK german guidelines .    2.175198038556915
the purpose of the present paper is to inform the german - speaking anaesthesiologist about the official cdc guidelines and to provide an update on the prevention of intravascular - device - associated infections .    2.123860557967345
we assessed the interindividual diagnostic variance of 39 experienced UNK by the kappa cohen interobserver variation analysis using UNK of eight different patients with different diagnoses .    2.192489149525812
arthroscopically normal findings showed a relatively acceptable interobserver correlation .    2.321560594757906
pathological changes , in contrast , often showed very little correlation , especially in the synovial membrane of the suprapatellar UNK , in the cartilage of the UNK groove and the posterior cruciate ligament .    3.2248341201427118
in patellar alignment there was also great interobserver variation .    2.4065609588327463
clinical relevance : when comparing arthroscopic findings with other imaging techniques the above results should be taken into account .    2.1473340371320133
furthermore , these results will affect the significance of medical expertise based only on pictures .    2.34748236539012
in addition , medical cost billing , which is based on arthroscopic findings , has to take into account that a wrong diagnosis is possible and therefore charges will be wrong .    2.4053896265796197
squamous metaplasia can be demonstrated in about 4 % of all invasive carcinomas of the breast .    3.284794604216776
primary squamous cell carcinomas of the breast are rare , since they occur in less than 1 % of all primary invasive breast carcinomas .    3.0685070068925873
in order to classify a breast tumor as a primary squamous cell carcinoma one must exclude an epidermal origin , especially from the nipple region and the possibility of metastatic infiltration of the breast by a squamous cell UNK from a different location .    2.490726060369207
causative and formal pathogenesis of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is not clear .    2.876637662120972
a pluripotent embryonal stem cell origin is discussed , considering the phylogenetic descent of the mammary gland from skin appendages .    2.0078057089294195
squamous metaplasia is also suggested to be a precursor of squamous cell carcinoma .    2.7512901738430884
here endocrine stimulation and chronic inflammation may both play an inductive role .    2.183306694916709
the number of published cases of squamous cell carcinomas developing years and decades after implantation of silicon prostheses has increased in recent years .    2.386023070125473
these tumors probably develop on top of squamous metaplasia induced by the inflammatory UNK .    2.2292854003428646
the limited success of thrombolytic therapy and the high percentage of patients who have to be excluded from lysis has resulted in the alternative application of primary ptca in acute myocardial infarction .    2.864838119040112
randomized studies so far available have shown a significant decrease of hospital mortality by primary ptca as compared to thrombolysis .    2.593056522930611
adjuvant stent implantation and a wider administration of glycoprotein iia / iiib inhibitors may further reduce mortality .    2.0818897630969913
for logistic and financial reasons however , not all patients with acute myocardial infarction can benefit from this therapeutic approach in spite of the high density of health care in germany .    2.761856267674638
of utmost importance is a reduction of the present " onset - to - opening " times by information campaigns , an improved triage , use of UNK times for pre - hospital lysis and improved thrombolytic agents .    2.5082619014602776
some 245 , 000 sporting accidents occur yearly in switzerland .    2.1648907000210142
the social accident costs amount to approximately 1 . 8 UNK UNK per year .    2.4214566829161157
every second sporting accident occurs during a ball UNK .    2.2705624878702957
for the shown sporting activities , distortion is the most common type of injury among adults and contained fractures are most common in children .    2.4191869090895906
as is to be expected , the number of accidents has grown along with the UNK popularity of UNK and in - line UNK .    3.567856177062863
these new sporting activities show no unknown injury patterns which would demand new treatment methods .    2.042846798622071
abstract : the combination of UNK ( meg ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) allows the localization and functional characterization of the somatosensory and motor cortex .    2.5218240730090473
however , this method is technically UNK and time consuming .    2.7219580723080496
therefore , functional imaging is still not established as routine procedure in neurosurgery .    2.387355975567465
the aim of the presented study was the development of a protocol , which allows the integration of functional meg data into presurgical planning and intraoperative navigation , as a routine method .    2.708853795928466
we report on a 15 - year - old girl and her relatives with typical features of ehlers - danlos syndrome type viii .    2.136499147016024
main symptoms of this disorder are UNK skin , easy UNK , joint UNK , features suggesting premature aging , and periodontal disease with early loss of teeth .    2.0204961414831373
the inheritance of this type of ehlers - danlos syndrome is autosomal dominant .    2.3252152553658156
the biochemical and genetic defects have not yet been elucidated .    2.5906486136907394
the acute liver failure ( alf ) is a complex syndrome resulting from loss of synthetic and metabolic functions of the liver .    2.5706167852164294
despite recent advances in intensive care medicine patients with severe alf have a very high mortality and the orthotopic liver transplantation still remains the only proven effective treatment of alf .    2.53867667958399
numerous attempts have been made to improve survival by using various extracorporeal support techniques , but none of these therapeutic approaches was able to increase the survival rate .    2.4483296111420465
liver support systems based on detoxification procedures only could not influence the deleterious course of the disease .    2.1735035205120776
it is certain that an ideal liver support system should be capable to fulfil the liver ' s essential synthetic and metabolic functions as well as detoxification and excretion .    2.1485888454659023
over the last years the development of hybrid liver assist devices has aimed at replacing these liver functions and therefore might give an advantage over earlier systems based on detoxification techniques only .    2.1121414209099005
this article gives a short review of the various liver support systems and focuses then on the hybrid liver support systems , their construction and the remaining problems after the first clinical applications .    2.4867425271519745
after a latency period of 20 years , in a 39 - year - old austrian UNK of chinese origin , a surgically removed rectal carcinoma , as well as the neighboring chronic inflammatory rectal mucosa with various degrees of dysplasia and one positive neighboring lymph node , showed helminthiasis in the histopathological examination , convincing us of a link between carcinoma and chronic helminthiasis .    2.0697712823273275
whereas the etiological context between chronic infection by schistosoma haematobium and endemic frequent urinary bladder carcinoma is considered a matter of fact , whether of not the incidence of intestinal carcinoma is increased in connection with chronic intestinal schistosomiasis is controversial .    2.1266624700464414
the etiological and pathogenetic link between helminthiasis and carcinoma should be considered in the same way as for other related inflammatory large - bowel diseases .    2.1877360821506544
in the sequence chronic inflammation - severe dysplasia , the formation of carcinoma could possibly occur .    2.244374878777088
besides a survey of UNK UNK and pathology , the link between rectal carcinoma and schistosomiasis UNK is pointed out by means of appropriate literature investigations .    2.8000579359530637
rupture of the carotid artery wall is a very rare postoperative complication .    3.0654114331747797
mainly ruptures of vein patches are described in the literature .    2.4050886569565177
this paper reports on a 51 - year - old patient with elective endarterectomy of the left internal carotid artery using v - y technique .    2.5243001241171474
on day 8 after operation , the carotid bulb ruptured .    2.6058860848926457
the suture line was not involved .    2.5825994704127146
in an emergency procedure the UNK tissue was resected and repaired using a dacron patch .    2.480181473415977
postoperatively the patient showed paresis of the left recurrent nerve but fortunately did not suffer any other neurological deficit .    2.4544590529465853
myocardial stunning ( contractile dysfunction in the presence of normalized perfusion ) and myocardial hibernation ( contractile dysfunction matching reduced perfusion ) have represented separate concepts of viable , but dyssynergic myocardium in the past .    2.1015466413635213
however , in vivo experimental and clinical work suggests that repetitive ischemia due to coronary artery disease may induce a gradual transition between UNK and hibernating myocardium .    2.2879667225606934
myocardial hibernation itself can result from a spectrum of ischemic conditions ranging from impaired myocardial blood flow reserve to frank hypoperfusion .    2.1283623540010725
with increasing severity and duration of ischemia , degeneration of cardiac myocytes , accumulation of glycogen and cell death ensue .    2.2273111209120318
UNK , there is an increase of extracellular matrix protein content leading to reparative fibrosis , which in turn limits functional recovery .    2.696862055084553
in the light of these structural features , the available methods for detection of viable myocardium , in particular dobutamine echocardiography and nuclear imaging techniques , offer complementary rather than contradictory information .    2.157190621375366
dobutamine echo has satisfactory sensitivity , excellent specificity , and high diagnostic accuracy for the detection of viable dyssynergic myocardium .    2.3930834471951052
while in the past only its predictive accuracy for segmental recovery has been validated , newer data show an improved survival after revascularization if at least four viable dyssynergic left ventricular segments in a 16 segment model can be identified by dobutamine echocardiography .    1.8781580182714708
the complete ( low and high dose ) dobutamine protocol can elicit several types of contractile responses ( sustained improvement in contraction or UNK response , biphasic response , new wall motion abnormality ) which should be interpreted in view of other clinical data including a previous infarction .    1.964351061511963
the test protocol can be used safely at the end of the first week after myocardial infarction .    3.121826325603199
if ischemia or viability is documented , revascularization should be performed promptly .    2.5227951487336076
a similar strategy should be followed in the setting of chronic coronary heart disease with left ventricular dysfunction .    2.502021130894598
since the structural changes of hibernating myocardium are progressive , time to revascularization is critical .    2.2798690984054804
on the other hand , responsible therapeutic planning requires proof of ischemia or viability before UNK a potentially hazardous revascularization procedure .    1.875527701849015
the coarctation of the aorta is a congenital narrowing of the aorta in the transitional area between the distal aortic arch and the proximal descending aorta .    2.2894586210208487
the coarctation causes an arterial hypertension of the upper half and an arterial hypotension of the lower half of the body .    2.8206166983629926
the indication for operative repair is given because of the hypertension with strain and possible insufficiency of the heart .    2.5899307716522904
the resection of the narrowed part of the aorta with end - to - end anastomosis or interposition of a prosthesis brings on the risk of a UNK .    3.1182089061628995
after a vosschulte - aortoplasty a recurrent coarctation is rarely seen .    2.2603230828971093
this method , however , brings on a higher risk of the development of an aneurysm .    3.808224191987831
in the following it is reported about a patient who underwent an operation due to an aneurysm 22 years after a vosschulte - aortoplasty .    2.5994204984138203
the aging of the italian population is an emerging public health priority .    2.232102086715048
in UNK italy is expected to have the highest world median age with nearly half of the population over 50 years old .    2.64464491859746
to avoid an unbearable burden of disease and disability on future generations , we must identify areas for intensive disease and disability prevention programs .    2.2056339147732396
a 14 year old UNK girl was admitted with recurrent UNK abdominal pain that had lasted for several weeks .    2.107018666900751
laboratory check , plain abdominal film and abdominal sonography did not show UNK immediately .    2.2855175622437507
increasing enzyme parameters though indicated UNK .    2.4232073348934136
endoscopic retrograde choledocho - UNK ( ercp ) was performed after abdominal sonography showed a dilatation of the choledochus .    2.717710430280961
it revealed a common - channel situation ( ductus choledochus and UNK ) and UNK .    2.6987557156817874
UNK and stone - extraction could not remove abdominal pain .    2.2122492922554287
laparatomy and choledocho - UNK could finally remove the symptoms .    2.3081116926277208
successful transplantation of autologous chondrocytes for repair of articular cartilage defects requires an UNK matrix - synthesis of the transplanted cells .    2.3727658257458657
this , in turn , is dependent on the composition of the synovial fluid ( sf ) of the respective joint .    2.7947173779024648
we addressed the question whether analysis of a patient ' s sf can predict the rate of matrix - synthesis of articular cartilage exposed to this sf in vitro .    2.9091368949910397
sf was obtained from 115 patients with disorders of the knee , including gonarthrosis ( n = 44 ) , meniscal tears ( n = 10 ) , rheumatoid arthritis ( n = 53 ) , and reactive arthritides ( n = 8 ) .    3.18539008770524
to assess the effect of sf on the matrix synthesis of articular chondrocytes , bovine cartilage was incubated in the presence of sf , and the rate of UNK synthesis subsequently determined .    2.8931180487573718
in some cases , a monoclonal antibody directed against igf - i was added .    2.6125503215896178
sf from patients with oa or trauma , respectively , stimulated pg - synthesis of bovine cartilage more markedly than did sf from patients with rheumatic arthritides .    2.2777714252138868
on the average , 60 percent of the sf - induced increase of cartilage matrix synthesis could be titrated out by an anti - igf - i - ab .    2.151326569419184
the best predictor for the sf - effects on pg - synthesis of exposed cartilage was the proportion of free igf - i ( r = 0 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 , spearman rank correlation ) followed by the sf - concentrations of igf - i ( with a positive sign ) , igfbp - 3 , il - 1 , and tnf ( all with a negative sign ) .    2.262944898885514
according to our data , igf - i is the most important anabolic factor in human sf with respect to cartilage pg - synthesis .    2.744252191291642
the proportion of free igf - i seems to be of special importance in this regard .    2.83270950290118
low sf - levels of free igf - i could be identified as a possible risk - factor for a sub - optimal UNK synthesis of chondrocytes exposed to this synovial milieu .    2.4005501627966654
the coincidence between panic disorder and depression is a well known phenomenon .    2.5583263610252382
however , only few studies investigated the coincidence of panic disorder with schizophrenia .    2.418225886252823
this may in part be explained by the fact that both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia may mask the clinical symptoms of a panic disorder .    2.446075024646641
we report on a female patient suffering both from UNK with panic disorder and paranoid schizophrenia according to icd - 10 .    2.3244256333076403
the productive psychotic symptoms responded well to treatment with a low dose of UNK , whereas the panic disorder was effectively treated with a combined therapy with imipramine and cognitive behavioral therapy .    2.8129416586198563
although it has to be questioned whether the coincidence between panic disorder and schizophrenia reflects two different diagnostic entities , the occurence of symptoms of a panic disorder in schizophrenia deserve further attention because these may be treated efficiently by a specific pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy .    2.09233820927941
a 54 - year - old female patient with a 10 - year history of UNK shunt resulting from communicating hydrocephalus of undetermined aetiology is reported .    2.28634054244599
transient gait disturbances and cerebral infarction at the age of 46 did not lead to further insights into the nature of the disease .    2.7472760623852848
after many years with only occasional disturbances , a distinct organic brain syndrome developed .    2.1112977215514794
thorough examination led to a tentative diagnosis of neurocysticercosis ; this was based on the history , liquor diagnosis and cerebral microcalcifications in ct .    2.6819938713838143
despite the initiation of specific therapy , the patient died of the sequelae of the disease .    3.2987218985855566
at autopsy , characteristic cicatricial residues of mainly basal UNK were found with collapsed parasitic cysts .    2.0443550789037883
additional intracerebral mesenchymal - glial reactions were less conspicuous .    2.259204736694474
residual UNK had caused UNK stenosis .    2.6384165217924007
death was due to UNK , bronchopneumonia and a lung abscess .    2.922864271064084
the clinical course and morphology of neurocysticercosis are discussed .    2.4623612016336103
the disease has become rare in our country , but is UNK the most important parasitic disease of the central nervous system .    2.762078301314607
the aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence , etiology and prognosis of severe connatal anemia in preterm and term children .    2.3798388517344082
all neonates born in the department of gynecology and obstetrics , university of kiel , were included .    2.382378133501124
in 18 of 18 UNK ( 0 . 98 permil ) UNK neonates ( birth weight 680 - UNK g ; 26 - 41 weeks of gestation ) , the initial hemoglobin level was below 10 g / dl .    2.410334358070093
in those children with birth weight below 2500 g the incidence was 6 . 8 permil .    2.2937451545300145
in 17 of 18 cases the cause of anemia could be clarified .    2.6128777596992756
in five preterm babies ( 28 % ) an acute UNK transfusion and in three newborns a UNK transfusion was responsible for the onset of anemia .    2.4192072444605532
in two cases there was rh incompatibility , in two cases placental bleeding , and in another two cases fetal tumour bleeding caused the anemia .    2.5198933224588016
in one fully developed newborn there was severe disseminated intestinal bleeding of unknown cause .    2.0209783574963005
another child suffered from ebv infection , and one had trisomy 13 with multiple malformations .    2.5374464640022287
ten children ( 55 % ) had to be resuscitated due to hypovolemic shock .    2.8553350742024164
fifteen children were intubated and ventilated mechanically .    2.4256340129341405
seven children ( 39 % ) ; ( six preterm babies and the newborn with trisomy 13 ) died between days 1 and 6 .    2.451327316361202
five of these seven children had to be resuscitated at birth .    2.705200129880227
six children ( 33 % ) showed evidence of neurologic disease when discharged ; five of these were resuscitated previously .    2.3511805181186287
five children ( 28 % ) including three full - term babies were developed normally .    2.2528537445264356
in conclusion , severe anemia with hemoglobin below 10 g / dl is very rare but serious .    2.23992797531009
it seems necessary to optimize primary resuscitation by immediate transfusion and monitoring of central venous pressure by umbilical vein catheter .    2.124499716388679
the prognosis can be influenced in a positive way .    2.6501911640605793
diagnosis of bacterial infection and / or sepsis in critically ill patients is a common problem in intensive care medicine .    2.930010082984826
white blood count , c - reactive protein ( crp ) , and the erythrocyte sedimentation rate ( esr ) are often used in the differential diagnosis of infection versus sirs ( systemic inflammatory response syndrome ) due to UNK causes .    2.6813067597228986
there is a number of non - infectious stimuli to cause leucocytosis and crp elevation .    2.9517513305378547
in the last 3 years , procalcitonin ( pct ) was determined to be a marker of severe bacterial infection , especially sepsis .    2.541798165635513
pct appears to have several advantages ; it is of non - hepatic ( yet unknown ) origin and useful in patients with hepatic insufficiency .    2.713606776165705
there is no pct - increase in acute graft - rejection , viral disease , and autoimmune disorders .    2.1836625010430266
some UNK showed a prognostic value of pct in sepsis due to peritonitis and pancreatitis .    2.3035438645252113
pct appears to be a new and helpful tool in the diagnosis and treatment of critically ill patients .    3.0246262312980186
further studies are needed to finally established pct in the daily management of critically ill patients .    2.2519508146104443
at this time significantly higher costs are the major UNK to daily or frequent measurements .    2.155398292825817
in this retrospective study , the meniscal status of 45 patients with conservatively treated complete anterior cruciate ligament ( acl ) tears is reported .    2.1603238262378985
the acl injury was initially documented by examination under anesthesia and arthroscopy .    2.286986816535474
treatment in all cases consisted of a standard protocol of early rehabilitation and UNK .    2.9898889164552043
the mean follow - up was 8 years .    2.7926837785694776
twenty - nine ( 65 % ) patients showed signs of meniscal pathology at an average of 3 years after the acl injury during the follow - up period .    2.6776265931402263
rearthroscopy was performed and showed a higher incidence of medial meniscus tears .    2.981696306573701
the most common tear of the medial meniscus was the UNK - handle type , followed by the flap tear and the single longitudinal split of the posterior horn .    2.821117412935506
secondary reconstruction of the acl was necessary in 24 patients complaining of the meniscus giving way .    2.9620147943154795
the remaining five patients had rearthroscopy 4 years after the acl injury and a partial meniscectomy and acl reconstruction was performed .    2.48896825718384
sixteen patients ( 35 % of the overall sample ) had no instability complaints or meniscal pathology during the follow - up period , but discontinued their sporting activities .    2.4905842626639965
we recommend that patients with ruptures of the acl should be investigated for meniscal tears and that early ligament reconstruction of the knee and UNK repair or partial meniscectomy should be considered simultaneously .    2.642733527061258
four children , 4 to 10 years old , with chronic uveitis were treated with cyclosporin a ( csa ; starting dosage 2 mg / kg per day ) and prednisolone .    2.5447492488871304
all children had previously received systemic steroids and / or cytotoxic agents , which resulted either in a poor therapeutic effect or in intolerable side effects .    2.220202252601445
in one child , suffering from uveitis in combination with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , a complete reduction of intraocular inflammation was achieved .    2.4766095282196967
in a second child treatment resulted in a marked reduction of inflammatory activity with stabilization of visual function , although a temporary increase in the steroid dosage was necessary at one stage .    2.2170141971577784
in the remaining two cases therapy failed to improve the intraocular inflammation .    2.664698407151461
during the time of treatment , ranging from 11 to 26 months , no serious side effects were observed .    2.825746753481298
all patients developed moderate hypertrichosis and one child gingival hyperplasia .    2.1842427090196246
in our < \ d > experience , cyclosporin a ( csa ) combined with low - dose systemic steroids is useful as a therapeutic alternative to steroids alone and to other immunosuppressive agents in severe cases of chronic uveitis in childhood .    2.111751818849076
allergic reactions in tattoos are comparatively rare .    2.401804541970452
in most cases the reactions are caused by different red UNK .    2.509985874004765
while in the past these reactions have been ascribed to mercury salts ( UNK ) and UNK UNK , now synthetic inorganic azo dyes have also been found to be responsible for such reactions .    2.9187582110804775
a 42 - year - old man presented with an allergic reaction in the red parts of his tattoos .    2.4401794427954444
histologically a chronic granulomatous , partly fibrous inflammation with UNK elimination of pigment granules was found .    2.058821160148579
spontaneous regression in a part of the inflammatory reaction was observed , simultaneously with UNK and scarring of the overlying skin .    2.820556334475932
the pigment used for UNK was found to be an aromatic azo derivative .    3.1797468551686094
in addition to a positive cutaneous reaction to the dye , the patient also showed a positive patch test to UNK as , used for the coupling of different dyes in the UNK industry .    2.7425051074306106
borrelia burgdorferi specific dna has been detected by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) in different specimens of patients with lyme disease ( ld ) .    2.3272306343488283
the aim of the present study is to evaluate pcr - diagnostic of urine specimens regarding rheumatologic diagnosis of lyme disease .    2.105016701829046
urine specimens of 77 patients ( ld , n = 34 ; undifferentiated arthritis ( ua ) , n = 25 ; arthralgia / UNK ( UNK ) , n = 18 ) and 15 controls were investigated .    2.682632169179599
flagellin gene ( 60 specimens ) or ospa - plasmid ( 32 specimens ) were used as targets .    2.2089169315656463
sensitivity of the flagellin - nested - pcr was 27 % , by ospa - nested - pcr only one positive pcr result was found .    2.1065813504183244
despite of low sensitivity pcr enabled the correct diagnosis of ld in two patients classified as ua .    2.369897892511388
therefore , pcr can give valuable hints in single cases if ld is clinically suspected .    1.9914686419082026
objective : to assess the clinical efficacy of a chemically standardized willow bark extract in the treatment of osteoarthritis .    2.916421421080199
methods : willow bark extract , in a dose corresponding to UNK UNK / day , was compared to placebo in a 2 - week , double - blind , randomized controlled trial .    2.618062416981198
the primary outcome measure was the pain dimension of the womac osteoarthritis index .    2.2909050541280704
secondary outcome measures included the stiffness and physical function dimensions of the womac , daily visual analogue scales ( vas ) on pain and physical function , and final overall assessment by both patients and investigators .    2.1017794127698086
results : 78 patients ( 39 willow bark extract , 39 placebo ) participated in the trial .    2.2996253171890606
a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo group was observed in the womac pain dimension ( d = 6 . UNK , 95 % c . i . = 0 . 2 - 12 . UNK , p = 0 . 047 ) ; the womac pain score was reduced by 14 % from baseline level after two weeks of active treatment , compared to an increase of 2 % in the placebo group .    2.8010880330565326
patient diary vas confirmed this result , and likewise the final overall assessments showed superiority of willow bark extract over placebo ( patients assessment , p = 0 . 0002 ; investigators assessment , p = 0 . UNK ) .    2.0271379028506
conclusion : willow bark extract shows a moderate analgesic effect in osteoarthritis .    2.2313214678866187
900 patients of five different specialists ( general medicine , internal medicine , neurology , orthopaedics , surgery ) in the german UNK bochum were investigated with a questionnaire about chronic pain .    2.45641290707692
chronic pain was defined as a continuous or UNK pain of longer duration than six months .    2.597932163756769
confusion between syncope and epileptic seizures is a common problem in clinical practice .    2.5165586810702587
recently , new insights into the phenomenology of transient cerebral hypoxia have been gained from video analysis of experimentally induced syncope .    2.0114911726988196
common elements of syncope include multifocal and generalized myoclonus , tonic body extension , UNK , UNK , eye deviations and hallucinations .    2.3529146610651814
thus , it is not the presence or absence of these features but their specific character that distinguishes syncope from epileptic seizures .    2.304986134238813
other clues for differential diagnosis include precipitating factors , UNK symptoms and postictal events , such as tongue bites and postictal confusion , which has been identified as the single most powerful factor discriminating syncope from epileptic seizures .    2.2170387889903966
in contrast , incontinence and head injury are common in both conditions .    2.2106532826142637
investigations such as electroencephalogram , tilt testing and postictal prolactin or creatine kinase levels may aid diagnosis but are never diagnostic in isolation .    1.8006188264530962
in rare cases , hypoxic and epileptic mechanisms may interact within one attack .    2.133381198445308
in the past two decades increasing research efforts have focused on the molecular biology of the cell .    2.6338462522301773
in the beginning , these research activities were purely academic without any direct clinical relation .    2.0795772013710434
a series of important discoveries , initiated particularly by the UNK of the genetic code and the discovery of the molecular basis of gene expression and genetics , the subsequent identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes and finally the description of major mechanisms which induce genetic instability in cells , now indicate the way to many new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies .    2.2946583575335486
in surgical oncology , these attempts are yielding the first clinical consequences .    2.3063969066959884
basic aspects of molecular cell biology as far as they are relevant for surgical oncologists are discussed .    2.2034684513518656
the compartment syndrome ( cs ) is characterized by an increased tissue pressure in a limited space .    2.7004940088598413
pathophysiologically , it is a multifactorial disease that is potentially induced by an initial trauma and develops according to the existence of cofactors .    2.7707413401290406
cofactors are , for instance , the circulation of the patient and the initial treatment of the impending cs .    3.2572487481666403
in particular , the microcirculation is altered with endothelial destruction , development of a capillary leak , protein loss from intravasal space and the development of an interstitial and intracellular third space .    2.2713359117424283
an impaired drainage of the lymphatic and venous system causes a venous infarction .    2.3392265059118102
an arterial infarction results if the tissue pressure exceeds the UNK pressure .    2.3080348180297694
an accompanying ischemia reperfusion mechanism increases the trauma load .    2.280144309561356
in disadvantageous cases , the patients are in danger of developing a multi - organ deficiency syndrome ( mods ) by an uncontrolled inflammatory reaction , by intravasal volume loss and by a UNK systemic reaction .    2.418735666837478
clinically , the patients suffer a UNK amount of pain , followed by neurological signs .    2.780516478479775
especially in UNK patients , tissue pressure measurement is useful .    3.1187496802374013
resuscitation of the circulation as well as splitting of UNK is important .    3.4881327358711194
in case of a manifest cs , UNK has to be performed as an emergency operation .    3.4203786949878547
even if cs is diagnosed early and fasciotomy is carried out early , the development of UNK cannot be avoided in every single case .    2.5312829658362466
the object of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the value of open and arthroscopic procedures at mid - term and long - term follow - up .    2.5142950370729493
during the period from january 1980 to june 1997 we performed 247 open ( technique : 134 according to eden - hybbinette - lange , 46 according to weber , 26 according to putti - platt , 41 according to bankart ) and 76 arthroscopic ( UNK morgan technique ) shoulder stabilization procedures .    1.7209564897869556
the mean follow - up for techniques was : eden - hybbinette - lange 11 . 1 years ( 2 . 9 - 16 . 7 years ) , weber 5 . 2 years ( 2 . 1 - 13 . 0 years ) , putti - platt 7 . 2 years ( 2 . 2 - 10 . 6 years ) , bankart 1 . 6 years ( 0 . 5 - 3 . 2 years ) , and morgan 3 . 5 years ( 2 . 8 - 5 . 1 years ) .    3.620353821768558
we observed that the classic open bankart procedure has superior results according to the criteria redislocation , range of motion , sports activity , and arthrosis in comparison with the other open procedures .    2.4770072023571665
the results shows that UNK , reconstructive , open procedures are not up to date .    2.318280986077527
the open bankart procedure UNK the pathology of the anterior glenoid rim only .    2.8778962945979054
the classic open bankart procedure seems to be the " gold standard " in open shoulder surgery today .    2.4731232559762004
the high redislocation rate of the arthroscopic procedure warrants a more UNK patient selection in the future .    2.491076803847453
background : our study compared the haemodynamic changes after spinal anaesthesia with 2 % UNK and 0 , 5 % plain bupivacaine .    2.505989954960941
hyperkalemia is a frequent disturbance .    2.9861978816314996
when hyperkalemia is associated with a rapid rise of the serum potassium concentration , the risk of cardiac impairment is greatest .    2.7720136941731828
usually the cooperative action of several causative factors is required to bring about a hyperkalemia .    2.2172790226562555
increasing age , diabetes mellitus , disorders of the renin - angiotensin - aldosterone - system , high - dose antibiotics , and UNK treatments may result in hyperkalemia .    3.036339840356102
the most important pathogenetic mechanisms are ( 1 ) renal insufficiency , ( 2 ) UNK UNK , ( 3 ) tubular disorders , and ( 4 ) cellular disorders .    3.2070735411936897
cidofovir is a nucleotide analogue with a long half - life time after phosphorylation UNK .    2.208240755134754
it is effective against cmv and can be given intravenously and UNK .    2.6716774520019397
the aim was to offer an alternative therapy for cmv retinitis to patients who could not receive standard treatment because of contraindications or refused it .    2.0593960732131626
the efficacy and tolerance of UNK injections of cidofovir should be evaluated .    2.411572195538218
a case of multiple eccrine spiradenomata is reported .    2.622352410894706
one of the tumours was histopathologically associated with dermal cylindroma , and immunohistochemical studies showed that the cylindroma cells differentiate towards the secreting portion of the eccrine sweat gland .    2.1593946802468977
the relationship among multiple eccrine spiradenomata , dermal cylindroma and multiple UNK is discussed .    2.28019408349997
in view of the risks of a varicella infection during pregnancy and the more and more observed severe course of infection , varicella infection has to be considered as a serious disease .    2.7819176538357318
the initial antibiotic treatment of bacterial meningoencephalitis has major implications for the course of the disease .    2.323626914173904
the current spectrum of infectious agents must be considered .    2.5400368296008327
antibiotics have to reach sufficient concentrations in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid for a UNK action to occur at the site of infection .    2.523137880598199
frequent problems arising in this condition are : ( 1 ) the non - observation of UNK infections , ( 2 ) the use of antibiotics not sufficiently active against gram - positive bacteria in UNK meningitis , ( 3 ) the development of meningitis following the use of ciprofloxacin in respiratory tract infections , ( 4 ) the UNK change in antibiotic regimens in focal parenchymal infections during delayed response to therapy , ( 5 ) the use of bacteriostatic antibiotics , and ( 6 ) the delay in administering sufficient antibiotic therapy during UNK UNK meningitis .    2.660438812716227
problems arising from these conditions are illustrated by case reports .    2.4483160068670275
therapy of rheumatoid arthritis with a combination of several disease - modifying drugs aims towards better control of the disease than achievable by monotherapy .    2.7185458848707937
based on a broad variety of clinical studies , revealing more or less positive results , several combinations have been suggested : .    2.437108568544815
the management of 178 patients with liver trauma ( 132 male , 46 female ; mean age 34 years ( range 3 - 88 ) presenting from january 1979 to august 1996 is reviewed .    2.069159785434936
110 cases were classified as simple injuries ( grade i or ii ) and 68 cases as complex injuries ( grade iii to v ) .    2.3729064415099272
the overall mortality was 32 % ( 57 patients ) .    2.3591800508951777
the mortality for true hepatic injury was 15 . 7 % .    2.6368890489459758
none of the patients with penetrating injuries died .    2.985749567455407
mortality was UNK by the type of liver injury and the number of associated injuries .    3.7090796249256215
the postoperative complication rate was 55 % .    2.8118786319033244
the most - frequent postoperative complications related to the hepatic injury were intrahepatic or UNK hematoma ( 12 . 9 % ) and postoperative bleeding ( 9 . 6 % ) .    2.7831394502966913
operative therapy for liver injuries depends on the grade of the injury .    2.9244829856644894
the majority of liver injuries can be managed by simple techniques , including electrocautery and application of hemostatic agents .    2.246605987745777
in complex injuries UNK , direct vessel ligation , and debridement of necrotic tissue is the method of choice ( UNK ' s procedure ) .    2.5484807038516966
in non - controlled bleeding , UNK UNK is a standard method .    3.8089964851799256
aim : the aim of the present study was to investigate knowledge , practices , and opinions on tobacco and oral health among dentists of the berlin dental association using a questionnaire .    2.0404860804647527
materials and methods : questions focussed on smoking habits , knowledge about oral malignancies and UNK and practical approaches to screening for oral mucosal diseases and other associations of tobacco with oral changes .    2.0619312168777975
the questions related to risk factors and behavioural counselling for patients and associated constraints .    2.7387350479236643
results : of a total of UNK questionnaires sent , UNK were received for evaluation ( 12 . 1 % ) .    2.5087786274408512
of respondents 9 . 5 % were regular smokers .    3.084980836484899
the median number of oral malignancies observed was 3 .    2.516512337935086
knowledge about some associations of oral changes such as wound healing was adequate .    2.224677389153058
a total of 93 . 1 % of respondents would refer patients with oral lesions .    2.5454130353144127
only 35 % take a regular history of both tobacco and alcohol consumption and 26 . 6 % explain the side effects of tobacco .    2.6170891977141744
some 73 . 4 % believed that the dentist could play a role in anti - tobacco counselling .    2.4512377886575014
limiting factors were lack of training and of competence in anti - tobacco counselling .    2.2072538078355204
conclusions : this study shows that there still is a considerable need for improvement of knowledge and for provision with effective anti - tobacco teaching material .    2.1318458023812386
since most of the respondents thought that the dentist should play a role in anti - tobacco counselling , adequate programmes in germany should be UNK and followed up .    2.3767647499340026
background : last year ' s pilot study , which examined for the first time a representative group of patients with UNK disease , showed that in this UNK changes in the ocular fundus can be expected in the form of defects of the retinal pigment epithelium .    3.0219696611853006
examination of more patients in this study should give further information about the character and extent of the alterations found .    2.813417040554939
the posterior luxation of the shoulder joint is a rarely reported and often not recognized lesion in the clinical workday .    2.7988332043622464
the authors present the first case of a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint in combination with an contralateral anterior shoulder joint fracture dislocation .    2.635391845026924
in that case the authors stress the importance of an exact clinical and radiology diagnostic and the right way to reduce a posterior luxation of the shoulder joint .    2.240574281013274
finally they draw the readers attention to operative steps to prevent a UNK of the shoulder joint .    2.7500300837322937
magnetic resonance tomography ( mrt ) has become the most important method in the workup of infantile cerebral complications after primary sonography .    2.6615946699467603
cerebral mr examination and image interpretation during the infantile period require extensive knowledge of morphological manifestations , their pathophysiological background , and frequency .    1.973562182654701
the choice of imaging parameters and image interpretation is demonstrated in infarctions and hemorrhages of the mature and immature brain .    2.1199165223903114
a review of the main differential diagnoses is also given .    2.726774822401076
the relevance of mr spectroscopy and fetal mri is discussed .    2.4499141804373266
currently laparoscopic surgery is limited by several factors .    2.8493543640508263
one of them is the precise handling of optics .    2.2920263384401167
up to now , in our hospital 52 laparoscopic operations have been done with a voice - controlled robot arm to handle the optics in gallbladder , stomach , large bowel and hernia operations .    2.09539153288971
the visual field is determined by the surgeon .    3.2481851250955494
in all cases handling of the robot arm was precise and the voice response exact and without technical problems .    2.051030337581993
twenty - nine operations were done by one operator as " UNK surgeries " .    2.2244389523960924
in 20 further cases there was one assistant .    2.8251870457726826
urine specimens were collected from 49 persons up to 10 days after UNK from cannabis use .    2.523639125827513
urine samples ( n = 135 ) were investigated for free and conjugated 9 - UNK - 11 - nor tetrahydrocannabinol ( thccooh ) by lc / ms / ms and for free and glucuronidated tetrahydrocannabinol ( thc ) and 11 - hydroxy - thc ( 11 - oh - thc ) by gc / ms prior to and after enzyme hydrolysis .    2.1995643584990807
concentrations for free and conjugated thccooh were measured with reference to 100 mg creatinine / dl urine .    2.389278612282842
cannabis use was classified as light , moderate and heavy according to the current literature .    2.911634735459756
in all groups chosen free and bound thccooh was present in urine samples on the day of the last use and on the next day .    2.576057188142372
urine samples from occasional and frequent users generally differed in the amount of thccooh and thccooh glucuronide .    2.2110863355091546
within 4 - 6 days the concentrations of free and glucuronidated thccooh in urine samples of heavy users decreased to those ranges present in urine samples of moderate and light users .    2.197863319269523
in frequent users , thc glucuronide and 11 - oh - thc glucuronide could be found up to 1 and 3 days after abstinence , respectively .    2.2622495731824013
in light users , neither thc glucuronide nor 11 - oh - thc glucuronide was detectable .    2.0128089378407577
the determination of conjugated thc and 11 - oh - thc in addition to free and bound thccooh is suggested as an aid in assessing the frequency of cannabis use , but is limited to samples obtained within a few days after the last consumption .    2.5005074578420805
the participation of social work in inpatient psychiatric care is generally considered necessary , but there is a lack of empirical studies in this field .    2.589792774718537
the analyses presented of a systematic documentation of social work interventions in UNK cases during an 11 - year period demonstrate that social workers are mostly involved in the treatment of chronic and previously treated patients .    2.4882357055963307
interventions in younger patients , most of whom are suffering from psychoses , aim at rehabilitation through activity ; in elderly patients with organic or depressive disorders , the major concern is to improve UNK care ; patients with neurotic or personality disorders comprise another group with a chronic course and a relatively poor outcome .    2.0672199044436312
social workers usually see their own interventions as successful , but patient groups who benefit greatly can be differentiated from groups with poor outcome .    2.0038939181619164
stiff - man syndrome is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by muscular rigidity and superimposed UNK .    2.8225848230027757
the etiology is still unknown and an autoimmune cause is discussed .    2.492481973658689
many differential diagnoses of muscular rigidity and of induration of the skin have to be considered .    2.7586732527387876
a 22 year old patient was admitted under suspicion of a stiff - man syndrome .    2.6004916171919534
he has had developed a painful rigidity of the trunk , starting in the neck .    2.5377272453116655
massive stiffness of the trunk with pale appearance of the skin and a beginning disorder of swallowing and respiration were observed .    2.569387052218762
clinical investigation , emg , cerebrospinal fluid and laboratory findings were all normal , thus excluding a stiff - man syndrome and other neuromuscular diseases .    2.1195458429260285
skin biopsy showed typical changes of buschke ' s scleredema adultorum , a rare connective tissue disorder of unknown etiology .    2.017216702942755
therapy with UNK and UNK led to a mild improvement of symptoms .    3.666773323623979
although rare , buschke ' s scleredema adultorum should be regarded as a differential diagnosis of the stiff man syndrome .    2.4998037758407063
urogenital infections are established as hazards to male fertility .    2.302742580171357
various pathophysiological hypotheses have evolved from experimental and clinical studies , facilitating explanation of the effects of bacteria and immunological events on reproductive tissues .    2.4359448406056994
numerous current studies have identified and evaluated infectious mediators accounting for specific molecular events in urogenital infections .    2.040998689497467
valuable studies can be expected to appear in the future due to improvements in diagnostic procedures and new classifications of urogenital infections .    2.57304526867452
especially for the planning of internal UNK with custom - made endoprosthesis and for UNK osteotomies a high - grade orientation is necessary .    2.4943264110720342
this orientation is improved by a 3d ct - controlled manufactured 1 : 1 model of the pelvis .    2.5374034004996746
this enables an exact classification of defect and deformity , planning of resection planes , design of the suitable custom - made implant and simulation of the operation technique as preoperative quality control .    2.0697606467775023
an UNK - plug ( pda - plug ) has been developed for transvenous closure of patent ductus arteriosus .    2.3651511129734617
it can be introduced into the ductus through standard venous sheaths with a diameter von 8 - 16 french .    2.3133941396225057
the plug is fixed in its target position by means of four distal ( aortal ) and two proximal ( pulmonary ) nitinol UNK .    2.141894107928949
in case of malpositioning the system can be pulled back into and retrieved through the sheath .    2.303505038924009
in animal experiments UNK of the implanted material was demonstrated .    3.4196108081301615
pda - closure was attempted in 58 patients ; the procedure was successful in 57 cases ; a residual ductal flow was present in eight patients .    2.423027182527113
during a follow - up of up to 24 months there were no complications .    3.2834165511611904
using 8 different monoclonal antibodies , immunohistology was performed on 36 follicular adenomas and on 28 follicular , 34 papillary , 27 medullary and 29 anaplastic carcinomas of the thyroid .    2.0544276349717348
the panel of antibodies was directed against broad - spectrum cytokeratins ( pan - ck , antibody UNK - 5 ) , against basic and acid high - molecular - weight ck of types 1 , 5 , 10 and 14 , against basic ( 5 and 6 ) and acid high - molecular - weight ck ( 13 ) and against basic ( 7 and 8 ) and acid low - molecular - weight ck ( 19 and 20 ) .    2.0742102514181897
with the exception of a large number of anaplastic carcinomas , nearly all other tumours exhibited strong immunoreactivity with antibodies against pan - ck , ck 8 and ck 19 .    2.0799743589787556
ck 20 expression was exclusively shown for 2 medullary carcinomas .    2.319388179454692
reactivity for high - molecular - weight ck could only , each time focally , be demonstrated for 14 papillary and 2 follicular carcinomas and for 2 anaplastic carcinomas with partial squamous differentiation .    2.0057537755158696
thirteen anaplastic carcinomas were not UNK by any of the ck antibodies applied .    2.460153047679268
ck 7 staining exceeding the staining of individual cells was observed in 26 papillary cancers .    2.393201062627866
in contrast , such a finding could only be obtained with each one follicular adenoma , medullary carcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma and with 5 follicular carcinomas .    2.1591512716994177
these results confirm earlier studies in that ck 20 expression among thyroid tumours is restricted to the neuroendocrine medullary carcinomas and that in a larger percentage of anaplastic thyroid carcinomas an epithelial phenotype can not be demonstrated even upon using broad - spectrum ck antibodies .    1.9879008340583548
new is the finding that there exist considerable differences between papillary carcinomas and all other non - papillary thyroid tumours regarding ck 7 expression .    2.015443184905064
this result might be of differential diagnostic value for the distinction of follicular and papillary thyroid neoplasias which sometimes have an overlapping histological pattern .    2.0570147128997904
purpose : to compare reading speed and reading comfort between closed - circuit television systems ( UNK ) with different image UNK rates .    2.3283072318494455
this surveillance study presents a literature review concerning the very inhomogeneous care emphasis of the acute psychosocial crisis both with respect to crisis insight and therapy methods and to professional responsibility .    2.2173317117183355
in detail general care models of psychotherapeutic crisis intervention are described , as well as disorder - and event - specific concepts and papers on crisis intervention with children , UNK - UNK , and adolescents of the last 10 years .    2.5866235110313136
in addition , the contributions of the empirical psychotherapy research and their results are presented as far as they are relevant to crisis intervention .    2.2435599112951192
however , all systems presently available have some special disadvantages .    2.2406525486693516
the recently introduced UNK septal occluder ( UNK ) , though , appears promising .    2.6509147353033047
it is a self - expanding and self - UNK double disc made from a nitinol mesh , which is UNK woven to give mechanical strength .    2.4361686623270686
both discs are separated by a connecting cylindrical portion .    2.273502065725504
its diameter may be chosen , so that it corresponds to that of the asd .    2.771850437554254
in the light of recent research findings the UNK of many commonly accepted concepts in psychosomatic medicine is discussed .    2.4124877009707424
they do not stand up to empirical UNK .    2.7236479561609452
this applies both to UNK models and to UNK of body and mind or of illness and health .    2.38346429336271
in terms of the self - object - body system a greater significance is attached to affects in the communication and acting receives an important interactive function .    1.990081578877135
the effects of the altered UNK positions on new therapy approaches are discussed .    2.2909211989043823
perioperative , mostly silent ischaemia in patients with coronary heart disease is difficult to detect by clinical examinations .    2.975790887741937
herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease - causing microorganisms .    2.8195771746611022
their prevalence can exceed 90 % depending on the socioeconomic status of the population .    2.7659670174005497
since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation , herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance .    2.7255836076684403
while treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences .    1.9213296908125552
additionally , development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment .    2.3893211986760847
we present a case history of a man with a b - cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal UNK .    2.6726964583216937
tumor invasion of the portal vein by ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head is classically known as a criterion for UNK .    2.327697972585803
despite improvement in operation techniques for portal vein resection during whipple ' s procedure and acceptable mortality and morbidity , in the case of uncertain tumor infiltration vascular resection cannot be recommended in general .    2.3163675037142397
the problem is the preoperative detection of tumor infiltration of the portal vein .    2.7766415012383407
often the surgeon is confronted with unsuspected macroscopic portal vein infiltration or tumor adhesion during the operation .    2.1604856516288793
between 1986 and 1995 105 patients underwent whipple ' s procedure for ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head in our department .    2.1528199378370414
in eight of these cases partial portal vein resection was performed because of macroscopic tumor infiltration or tumor adhesion .    2.4860564813215555
in all eight cases the preoperative diagnostic procedures with ct and UNK did not show any suspicion of tumor infiltration .    2.4516028258175715
in four of the eight cases histological tumor infiltration of all vascular layers was found .    2.2879947849444044
the patients without tumor infiltration of the portal vein showed a survival time after surgery of 27 . 78 months in contrast to 6 . 67 months in the group with histologically proven tumor infiltration .    2.5645997626658326
endovascular , UNK ultrasound ( ipeus ) , a new diagnostic procedure , can give helpful information regarding portal vein involvement .    2.4455491472791526
although the ipeus is not a standard diagnostic procedure it was shown to detect portal vein infiltration with high sensitivity and specificity .    2.4898852449686975
our results indicate that in such cases where portal vein infiltration has been excluded by ipeus , patients with macroscopic tumor adhesion do benefit from partial portal vein resection .    2.259745634254872
progression in medical research and economic needs require new planning and organization of treatment strategies .    2.168674419344307
this does also apply for stroke treatment : new pathophysiological knowledge , positive results of thrombolytic therapy and the UNK importance of early treatment at stroke units justify that stroke must be regarded as an emergency .    2.3883515322600375
timing is of utmost importance .    2.666421220465874
time - based management serves as a planning model for a new stroke treatment strategy .    2.2531107936001895
the treatment process is divided into three phases : alarming , pre - hospital and in - hospital phase .    2.573573324683434
the effectiveness of each of these phases is influenced by several variables ( personnel , technical equipment , course of the disease , etc . ) .    2.5828744471476757
knowledge of each separate phase helps to discover weaknesses , which allows an aimed improvement , e . g .    2.0585895016304963
public education , training of paramedics and medical personnel .    2.342398910636381
modern communication systems allow new information transfer , which can help to avoid unnecessary transport of patients .    2.835114839129452
prosthetic valve endocarditis ( pve ) is a severe complication after heart valve replacement .    2.73024760383235
incidence ranges in literature between 0 . 1 % and 2 . 3 % ( mean 0 . 4 % ) per patient year ( UNK ) .    3.2540481421154763
pve is classified as " early " or " late " ( occurence within or after 60 days following heart valve replacement ) .    2.0916488816927146
in this review we present the clinical outcome of pve as well as the most common diagnostic criteria ( UNK criteria ) , the potential etiologies and the most frequent bacteria .    3.4444497664650333
the spectrum of therapeutical alternatives is discussed and a special attention is directed to the development of prevention standards .    2.8340301208458043
recently intra - atrial defibrillation has become an interesting alternative to external defibrillation and drug therapy for the treatment of atrial fibrillation .    2.603623593345767
low - energy intra - atrial defibrillation can be used to restore sinus UNK f . ex .    2.5945462725795894
after a failed external cardioversion or during an electrophysiologic study when the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs should be avoided .    2.362213445325176
additionally this new technique has led to the development of implantable atrial defibrillators for the treatment of selected patients suffering from chronic atrial fibrillation .    3.210786750403401
intra - atrial defibrillation seems to be a highly effective and safe method , but little experience exists concerning the outcome so far .    2.5344079527214696
especially the potential risk of inducing ventricular proarrhythmia is subject of current controversy .    2.261367604401578
modern imaging techniques are a substantial part of treatment planning for minimally invasive radiotherapeutic procedures .    2.40480039430604
the aim is three - dimensional assessment of the target volume and adjacent critical structures .    2.958812038460226
in this paper , we report on our clinical experience with a precise system for stereotactic image correlation .    2.6137208905550375
hereby , the advantages of each imaging modality can be combined .    2.6083323518002857
precise immobilization of the patient is a prerequisite .    3.829284759070468
the immobilization method has an accuracy of less than 1 mm .    2.6928929182331567
this method was evaluated in a clinical study in which a tumor control rate of 93 % was achieved in patients with brain metastases after stereotactic single high dose radiotherapy .    2.795424849448285
this indicated the excellent reliability of this treatment planning method .    2.5141069785405055
the integration of functional image information , such as blood flow or activation of cerebral cortical areas , will be evaluated in the future .    2.6774183468206814
olfactory dysfunction seems to be one of the most frequent symptoms in idiopathic parkinsonian syndrome ( ips ) .    2.7509284108465923
in contrast to the increasing number of studies providing evidence of the usefulness of olfactory tests in the diagnosis of ips , clinical assessment of olfactory function is rarely performed .    2.428966352514567
this may be due to the lack of an easy - to - use , inexpensive , standardized , and reliable test .    2.799883765318725
in this study , we administered the newly developed " UNK ' UNK " test to a group of 40 UNK ips patients and compared the results with 40 healthy controls matched for age , gender , and smoking habits .    2.327152243660877
in all three UNK including odor identification , odor detection threshold , and odor discrimination , the control group scored significantly better than the ips group , yielding a specificity and sensitivity of 90 % each .    2.14344932966368
our results indicate that olfactory disturbances in ips can be found at early stages of the disease , appear bilaterally , and do not correlate with the dominant side of parkinsonism .    2.387694020993234
therefore , we emphasize that olfactory testing may be a useful tool in the diagnosis of ips .    3.012188935367424
purpose : the goal of this exemplary study was to integrate morphological and functional mri to establish computer - based , preoperative therapy planning for tumors , UNK cervical carcinoma .    2.4427832614479037
drug - induced toxic epidermal necrolysis ( ten ) is a rare but frequently lethal disease of the skin and mucosa of unknown etiology .    2.8313630909708203
toxic metabolic and immunologic products in the serum have been discussed as possible causes .    2.4068411957785405
for this reason we have performed plasmapheresis on these patients for many years .    2.3628071650377716
results regarding survival and healing of the lesions are quite favorable , as exemplified with two patients described here who UNK from the procedure despite their old age .    2.3090950026914316
in dermis and epidermis , there was a striking increase of macrophages and a relative increase of cd8 - positive lymphocytes which might act as cytotoxic effector cells ; these findings can be interpreted as the result of an immunological reaction .    2.2161136560930306
an increased staining of lesional epidermis with tnf , as previously noted by other UNK , should be interpreted with caution since necrotic cells are involved .    2.020180285342642
the majority of inflammatory frontal sinus diseases requiring operative intervention can now be managed successfully by endonasal surgery .    2.1608977663585645
in problematic cases , however , optimal exposure of the entire frontal sinus and possibly complete mucous membrane removal combined with sinus obliteration must be achieved .    2.3491442401199842
in these cases , external frontal sinus surgery is indicated .    2.509505563080798
impaction of an intramedullary nail during extraction is an unpredictable and delicate situation .    2.09316641581964
its problematic nature is UNK on a report of two cases , one with a UNK nail and one with a modern solid titanium nail .    2.7718507383367683
this event is caused by ingrowth of new bone formation into the slot or the dorsal flute respectively .    2.403756561760852
the new bone formation is a mechanical barrier which effectively forces the distal part of the nail to UNK against the cortex .    2.6033560010957943
both , the slot of the UNK reamed UNK UNK nail and the wider dorsal flute of the solid titanium nail , realize certain therapeutic concepts .    2.2902931753761613
their UNK benefit within the concept of interlocking nailing is doubtful .    2.5284017970148445
primary intracranial germ cell tumors are rare neurological diseases .    2.685689844247356
secreting germ cell tumors that predominantly appear in the pineal region are characterized by elevated levels of - hcg and afp in csf .    2.3426703955972425
adequate diagnostic and therapeutic regimens of these tumors are still under debate .    2.803687493873758
we present the case of a patient suffering from spinal metastasis of a secreting germ cell tumor with raised levels of - hcg in csf .    2.2629263205778187
six years before , a UNK of intermediate differentiation had been diagnosed by stereotaxic biopsy .    2.7852507569862275
this demonstrates the importance of an early detection of a germ cell neoplasm in case of midline - sized brain - tumors by evaluation of - hcg and afp in csf and serum .    2.518983753998514
today , different therapeutic strategies depending on the histological diagnosis are available and justify a high priority of a surgical tumor biopsy .    2.50084036927338
however , the value of stereotaxic procedures remains controversial .    2.591429518584154
recently published data gave evidence of a definite improved prognosis of secreting cns germ cell tumors following combined treatment with high - dose polychemotherapy , surgical resection and radiation of the tumor area .    2.5444955471711364
- hcg and afp may serve as useful markers to enable follow - up of the disease .    2.4654953512368927
in order to get a better data management of complications in orthopedic surgery and in order to get comparable statistics a standardisation of nomenclature and classification of complications is demanded since 1 . 1 . 1997 .    2.368228528155007
the orthopedic university clinic of heidelberg started with a register of all early complications of all inpatients .    2.116184965211882
according to a standardized nomenclature all occured complications the doctors put in the data of complications in a database .    2.434030121100757
these data were controlled , complemented and classified by members of the quality UNK group .    2.444511505645923
this guideline consists of five parts : catalogue of diagnoses , general and special definitions , classification and an allocation table of diagnoses to grades of severity .    1.9493995246652875
the internet plays an important role in a growing number of medical applications .    2.839670535454177
finding relevant information is not always easy as the amount of available information on the web is rising quickly .    2.608071817487606
even the best search UNK can only collect links to a fraction of all existing web UNK .    2.0757559185601493
in addition , many of these UNK documents have been changed or deleted .    2.221124673699847
the vast majority of information on the web is not UNK with conventional methods .    2.6082424937619977
new search strategies , technologies and standards are combined in intelligent search agents ( UNK ) and robots , which can retrieve desired information in a specific approach .    2.437456460198251
with the availability of modern imaging modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , contrast - enhanced computed tomography ( ct ) , and transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) , diagnostic options in the evaluation of marfan patients have been improved profoundly .    2.6132505017918026
the most recent diagnostic advances comprise noninvasive tissue characterization of the aortic wall , immunofluorescence studies or pulse UNK analyses of skin and cultured dermal fibroblasts , and molecular analysis at the cdna / dna level of the UNK - 1 gene .    2.3214227371974094
new diagnostic insights have eventually led to revised UNK criteria for the diagnosis of marfan syndrome .    2.6137100225881373
the diagnostic reliability as well as the advantage and limitation of these recent diagnostic strategies are discussed : moreover diagnostic concepts for patients with neonatal as well as classic marfan syndrome are presented and discussed in the context of the clinical management during adolescence , UNK as well as in the pre - and postoperative patient .    2.981569535484117
primary defects of skeletal growth and development can be subdivided into hypoplasias , dysostoses and dysplasias .    2.120734943755517
hypoplastic bones are small but otherwise normal .    2.4145655973046045
generalized skeletal hypoplasias comprise various forms of primordial dwarfism and syndromal disorders including trisomy 21 and UNK - turner syndrome .    2.1464712500163676
dysostoses are defects of bones as organs resulting from errors of morphogenesis .    2.1796674572519947
many of them are caused by mutations of single genes in the cascade of morphogenetic gene sequences .    2.3220040933383603
dysplasias are defects of bone as tissue .    2.552806210843183
some of them ( e . g . UNK , UNK type of metaphyseal UNK ) are caused by defects of signal genes influencing cell division or differentiation .    2.754760130346949
others result from gene mutations affecting the cellular production of matrix components .    2.1721855631076776
examples are UNK such as osteogenesis UNK and some UNK dysplasias .    2.49673027700117
finally , disorders such as UNK , result from defects of UNK - osseous homeostasis .    2.8485469811306263
the study of skeletal defects helps to UNK the complexity of normal skeletal development .    2.8107830456360166
human parvovirus b19 causes erythema UNK ( fifth disease ) and UNK crisis .    2.5057517342784883
in pregnancy , b19 may be transmitted on to the fetus resulting in hydrops fetalis .    2.3127035376430904
b19 is sometimes associated with thrombocytopenia and vasculitis .    2.347199855459457
in immunocompromised patients , b19 may persist causing chronic infection .    2.422509173104686
several methods for detecting b19 virus or specific antibodies are now available .    2.1956575938643996
b19 infection does not usually require therapy .    2.4087699540112006
efficacy of immunoglobulins in chronic b19 infection has been demonstrated .    2.706840981398179
in absence of significant symptoms and signs , the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism ( pe ) remains difficult .    2.691568488255216
sensitivity and specifity of laboratory tests , chest x - ray , and ecg on their own is low .    2.477729187712605
echocardiography is particularly useful in critically ill patients suspected of having pulmonary emboli and can help identify right ventricular pressure overload .    2.3090093427202207
venous ultrasonography is useful in patients with suspected pe , but normal results do not rule out pe .    2.6576067852831433
helical ct with contrast medium can identify pulmonary emboli .    2.496802447740376
however , if the ct findings are normal in the presence of a high index of clinical suspicion , only larger pulmonary embolism are ruled out , and angiography with the focus on distal pulmonary vasculature should be performed .    2.306175820673877
the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism should be made by combining clinical assessment , several diagnostic techniques , and finally pulmonary angiography in doubtful cases .    2.3520981426350955
heparin remains the standard therapy for patients with stable hemodynamics .    3.4397290910739793
thrombolytic therapy is recommended in hemodynamically compromised patients .    3.0262141664978546
in short - term dose regimes , the thrombolytic agents urokinase , streptokinase , and rt - pa seem to be equally efficient .    2.4270871442395667
so far , however , no study has proven that thrombolytic therapy significantly reduces mortality in pulmonary embolism .    2.6012493193655697
background : data on mesopic vision after lasik are not available to date .    2.318222094033498
we therefore evaluated mesopic vision in myopic eyes before and after lasik .    2.39069852631815
renal tubular UNK is a rarely recognized condition characterized by UNK , UNK ' s sequence and congenital anuria leading to UNK or neonatal death from respiratory failure .    2.9257569352841903
it is thought to be inherited in an autosomal recessive manner .    2.572937203383538
definitive diagnosis is based on renal histology , revealing the lack of proximal tubule differentiation .    2.840120247596055
two additional cases of affected UNK in a family with parental consanguinity are reported .    2.5457434386176825
UNK and immunohistochemical studies confirmed structural and functional immaturity of the proximal tubule .    2.541954978097326
further findings include bilateral renal vein thrombosis .    2.3680206125192993
the clinical and morphological parameters defining this disorder and the possible mechanisms of pathogenesis are discussed .    2.3704220201724273
articular cartilage has only a small capacity for UNK .    2.7591419728366406
this makes the repair of articular surfaces difficult .    2.5984725685730026
in UNK pridie described his method of resurfacing osteoarthritic knee joints .    2.112317440202442
this operation is still in widespread use today .    2.626235075526713
pridie introduced the principle of drilling exposed subchondral bone with the objective of encouraging a fibro - cartilaginous repair .    2.24504325393792
the newly formed fibrocartilaginous layer that develops over the lesion in osteoarthritis may be enough to decrease patients symptoms .    2.062401508733953
the choice of the treatment should be based on factors such as age of the patient , UNK of symptoms , activity level and functional demands on the joint , site and stage of the lesion .    3.4328315799224525
the drilling operation remains useful in UNK and osteochondrosis dissecans .    2.6703617009122675
recent immunobiological findings together with advances in UNK , UNK in clinical trial design , and mri developments have led to a variety of therapeutical approaches in multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .    2.711989349993248
however , in contrast to successfully introduced new treatments , a number of therapeutical failures exist as well : despite impressive data from animal models , convincing concepts , and promising phase i / ii studies , some investigated drugs and strategies showed no positive effects in clinical trials , or trials had to be terminated because of unexpected side effects .    2.07426482474587
tumor necrosis factor ( tnf ) - antagonists which have led to negative effects in two studies ( UNK , UNK ) are discussed in detail .    2.9805003775858423
these results raise critical questions concerning the hypothetical pathogenesis of ms lesions and the value of mri in the assessment of clinically relevant therapeutic drug effects .    2.4864832577265044
in addition to a description of the immunobiological background , studies on the immunosuppressive agents UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK , trials for the cytokines interleukin - 10 and tgf - 2 , the studies on UNK by intravenous immunoglobulins ( ivig ) , oral tolerance , and extracorporeal UNK are discussed .    2.4012356747667534
isolated pancreatic metastases from renal - cell carcinomas ( rcc ) are extremely rare .    2.434915595954274
in many cases the time between the nephrectomy and diagnosis of UNK metastases is reported to exceed 10 years .    2.5436926924209304
therefore , the initial diagnosis may be overlooked when there is a prolonged disease - free interval .    2.9902764265448303
when it does occur simultaneously or UNK , aggressive surgical resection , when possible , seems to be the most effective treatment for this metastatic lesion .    2.672839471194982
surgical resection can provide long - term survival in selected cases .    2.850198003395491
we present the case of a 69 - year - old woman in whom two pancreatic metastases were treated by a left - sided subtotal UNK with splenectomy , 12 years after radical nephrectomy for a rcc .    2.3235365166582134
the patient simultaneously presented with both a mass in the body of the pancreas and a right - sided colon cancer .    2.4627957379268373
thus , the diagnosis of pancreatic metastasis of colon cancer was suspected initially .    2.8388159972092657
both tumors were UNK resected , and histological examination revealed two pancreatic metastases from the previous rcc .    2.5965123075644962
in the world literature this report represents the eighth case of multiple pancreatic metastases due to rcc .    2.127216760854761
it illustrates a rare indication of pancreatic resection because of pancreatic metastasis .    2.260232064635564
the need for prolonged follow - up of patients is emphasized .    3.2921144650720917
the few reports on surgically treated pancreatic metastases from rcc are reviewed after the presentation of this case .    2.3445942471798946
delusion is understood to mean UNK disconcerting UNK with a tendency toward subjective certainty that lose their disconcerting character when made the object of psychiatric analysis in the knowledge of their independence from mental disorder .    2.0845885331123633
the perceptions from which UNK arise are dynamically UNK according to their role in the structural context .    2.703313270236507
the realisation pressure that UNK the perceptions and is intensified in psychotic UNK is a precondition for the delusion .    2.320219509229203
the failure of derealisation brought about by the psychotic UNK of the structure is also a requirement .    2.8971180403730057
based on a case study , considerations arising out of the initial stages of schizophrenic delusion are extended to other forms of delusion and to the conditions for chronification .    2.5580013150570653
high - dose chemotherapy ( hdct ) is a promising treatment for patients with germ cell tumours and a poor prognosis .    2.933799048519037
the selection of patients who may profit from this intervention is challenging for the urologist , as the indication has to be carefully established .    2.68813508476622
exclusion criteria primarily concern impaired organ functions .    2.3305964594326465
prior to hdct haematopoietic stem cells are obtained after the administration of conventional - dose chemotherapy plus g - or gm - csf stimulation .    2.2143360507244205
hdct consists of a combination of carboplatin , etoposide and UNK or cyclophosphamide .    2.888713619136725
after hdct , UNK monitoring and maximal supportive care are essential .    2.211904437579532
it is therefore recommended that hdct only be administered at specialized centres .    2.1443131019003188
pyoderma gangrenosum develops in most patients between the age of 25 and 54 years .    2.7071326464231213
it usually occurs in otherwise healthy persons or in association with a systemic desease .    2.5190805732723165
several clinical variants of pyoderma gangrenosum have been described .    2.5373523108273757
extremely painful ulcerations are characteristic and evolve rapidly .    2.346085899144186
malignant pyoderma , the variant described in our case report , is an aggressive variant of ulcerative pyoderma gangrenosum , rapidly progressive and a potentially lethal ulcerative disease .    2.203789159260849
the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum depends on recognition of the evolving clinical features because histopathologic changes are not specific and characteristically serological or hematological markers of the disease do not exist .    2.284428150999638
histopathologic findings , however , always include vasculitis , either in form of the necrotizing cutaneous vasculitis ( 7 ) , granulomatous ( 1 ) or lymphocytic vasculitis ( 2 ) .    2.6992065931614064
we report on a 36 - year - old male patient , who underwent surgery for repair of an aneurysm of the aortic arch .    2.877866675797105
the aneurysm occurred two months after exacerbation of a malignant variant of pyoderma gangrenosum with nearly lethal exit .    2.3658663846213175
an association of pyoderma gangrenosum with vasculitis has been described previously , but the present report is the first to describe an aortic arch aneurysm which seems to be associated with necrotizing UNK of the vasa vasorum caused by a pyoderma gangrenosum .    2.9467995328124905
we could demonstrate successful perioperative treatment for prevention of exacerbation of pyoderma gangrenosum with prednisone and clofazimine    2.406453811484899
background and purpose : to test the association of cardiac sources of embolism with territorial type brain infarcts .    2.307397730211806
defects of the dorsal and ventral ligament complexes of the lumbar spine results to an instability of the functional spinal unit .    2.659947663312692
for the prognosis of secondary instability due to disko - ligamentous injuries the functional insufficiency of the lasting scars is a larger problem than the UNK loss of osseous stability with fast healing tendency .    2.086162112859065
the main goal of the present biomechanical study in vitro was to demonstrate the different grades of instability in the correlation to progressive disko - ligamentous defects as well as stabilisation through dynamic and static procedures .    2.4079075976519966
with a transpedicular screw - UNK - system the segmental function was preserved and instability was abolished .    2.419426426428867
after rigid instrumentation with a fixateur intern remained a residual range of motion due to which can result refuse to bending moments without spondylodesis in an implant failure .    1.9739241861755645
ct - or mri - guided stereotactic procedures should be a standard in a modern neurosurgical unit .    2.341901668050077
analysing 71 cases the indications and results of stereotactic neurosurgery are presented .    2.5174088413843125
in 53 patients stereotactic serial biopsies of different intraaxial lesions were performed , in 5 patients a spontaneous haemorrhage of the basal ganglia was removed by lysis with r - tpa .    2.103502149271139
in 3 patients suffering from hydrocephalus due to diencephalic cysts a UNK shunt device was implanted .    2.3351811252221752
in 3 patients an intracerebral abscess was aspirated and UNK .    2.4381033084464767
a stereotactic guided craniotomy and excision of small deep - seated lesions was performed in 6 cases .    2.491586451849091
the accuracy of stereotactic tumour biopsies was 88 . 7 % in our series , in accordance to other authors .    2.5827458694112457
the stereotactic aspiration and drainage of an intracerebral abscess provides accurate localization and minimal cortical damage and offers the possibility of intracavitary application of antibiotics .    2.11764343655726
the stereotactic internal shunt implantation seems to be an alternative approach in the treatment of diencephalic cysts due to its minimal UNK and low operative risk .    2.8060271470307687
the aspiration of basal ganglia haematomas with insertion of an external drainage allows the lysis of the haematoma with r - tpa or urokinase .    1.9597782470941285
with stereotactic guidance small , deep - seated intraaxial lesions can be well localized and removed .    2.203539567922078
radiotherapy of patients with prostate cancer offers an alternative to radical prostatectomy in early stages ( t1 - t2 ) .    2.8519487708290483
in locally advanced prostate cancer a high dose or combined radiotherapy is more effective than radical surgery with concurrent lower morbidity and mortality .    2.2077371091387823
recent developments in linear UNK technique , the progress in dose calculation and planning techniques provide the means to apply higher doses to a given tumor volume while effectively protecting the surrounding normal tissue at the same time .    1.9511881262213142
these improvements may possibly reduce the rate of therapy related side effects or complications significantly .    2.5144820188976147
the combination of external beam radiotherapy and interstitial brachytherapy as well as the combination of hormone therapy and external beam radiotherapy are most likely more effective than percutaneous irradiation alone .    2.5975544626714235
in special cases with a very low risk of recurrent tumor an interstitial permanent brachytherapy alone is indicated .    2.7818860950902398
future developments ( i . e . intensity modulated radiotherapy - UNK , combined thermo - radiotherapy , proton - or UNK ) may further increase the rate of curative treatments in patients with prostate cancer .    2.8455283010904884
skin is the second most common site of extranodal lymphoma .    2.387936289563197
the significance of cutaneous b - cell lymphomas has been underestimated due to the lack of monoclonal antibodies and molecular genetics in former years .    2.5804998697664434
cutaneous b - cell lymphomas represent a heterogenous group of entities which show variation in histology , immunophenotype and in prognosis .    2.0702290359363666
the most common entities presenting in skin are follicular lymphomas , marginal zone b - cell lymphomas , and diffuse large b - cell lymphomas .    2.1286850471549594
the majority of primary cutaneous b - cell lymphomas have an excellent prognosis .    2.3999862696978775
whereas in b - cell lymphomas with secondary spread to the skin the clinical course is dependant on the prognosis of the primary lymphoma .    2.747781456386376
it is evident that primary cutaneous lymphomas are distinct from nodal lymphomas and not extranodal manifestations of their lymph - node - based UNK .    2.0246120849226314
in the current review the morphologic spectrum of cutaneous b - cell lymphomas comprising primary and secondary cutaneous b - cell lymphomas is discussed according to the who classification UNK .    2.454065013920924
the UNK derivative ketamine is a non - competitive n - methyl - d - aspartate ( nmda ) receptor antagonist with the thalamo - UNK projection system as the primary site of action .    2.099610910712383
racemic ketamine consists of the enantiomers s ( + ) - ketamine and r ( - ) - ketamine .    2.340207567785484
racemic ketamine has never been considered an adequate anaesthetic agent in neurosurgical patients since it produces regionally specific stimulation of cerebral metabolism ( cmro2 ) and increases cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) and intracranial pressure ( icp ) .    1.9654224970896457
however , recent experiments suggest that both UNK ketamine and s ( + ) - ketamine may reduce infarct size in animal models of incomplete cerebral ischaemia and brain injury .    2.1223799779346213
this experimental protective effect appears to be related to decreases in ca + influx and maintenance of brain tissue magnesium levels due to nmda and UNK receptor blockade by ketamine .    2.1385859413761126
studies in dogs have shown that racemic ketamine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg ) increases cbf in the presence of the cerebral vasodilator n2o .    2.6027595620821242
in contrast , studies in rats without background anaesthesia showed increases in cbf after racemic ketamine ( 100 mg / kg i . p . ) .    2.146221588858705
this suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre - existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics .    2.1992549323291906
cerebrovascular co2 reactivity was maintained regardless of the baseline cerebrovascular resistance .    2.444100499912021
there are several mechanisms by which racemic ketamine may increase cbf .    2.255948418065579
it induces dose - dependent respiratory depression with consequent mild hypercapnia in spontaneously ventilating subjects .    2.101329993066917
this produces vasodilation due to the intact cerebrovascular co2 reactivity .    2.8939092297558617
racemic ketamine also induces regional neuroexcitation , which leads to stimulation of cerebral glucose consumption in the limbic , extrapyramidal , auditory , and sensory - motor systems .    1.926166981409833
this regional neuroexcitation with increased cmro2 produces increases in cbf that can be blocked by infusion of barbiturates or benzodiazepines .    2.201469890208059
however , increases in cbf with racemic ketamine ( 1 mg / kg ) may also occur during normocapnia and without changes in cmro2 .    2.498881861446724
this effect is related to some additional direct cerebral UNK potency of racemic ketamine based on a mechanism involving blockade of ca + channels .    2.3387007982873724
the effects of racemic ketamine on cbf autoregulation have not been investigated systematically .    2.6811199314921974
however , studies in rats have shown that cbf autoregulation was maintained with low - and high - dose s ( + ) - ketamine .    2.6349509718257917
infusion of racemic ketamine alters intracranial volume and icp .    2.587266175575984
studies in spontaneously ventilating pigs with and without intracranial hypertension have shown that racemic ketamine ( 0 . 5 - 5 . 0 mg / kg ) produces increases in paco2 and icp .    2.759004165307536
in contrast , identical experiments with mechanical ventilation and controlled paco2 showed no changes in icp following racemic ketamine infusion .    2.0668444625663422
this implies that increases in icp are related to inadequate ventilation with consecutive hypercapnia and increases in intracranial blood volume .    2.092137450940025
however , mechanical ventilation may not be sufficient to control icp following racemic ketamine .    2.462783763279421
experiments in mechanically ventilated dogs indicate that racemic ketamine ( 2 mg / kg ) increases cerebral blood volume and icp even in the presence of UNK , a response that is reversible by hyperventilation or the administration of diazepam .    2.732108827080971
studies in patients have shown that racemic ketamine ( 2 . 0 mg / kg ) reduces cbf in the presence of cerebral vasodilators like halothane or n2o .    2.600340639407106
in contrast , studies in UNK humans showed increases in cbf after racemic ketamine ( 2 - 3 mg / kg ) .    2.4163864732069356
this observation is consistent with animal studies and suggests that the cerebrovascular effects of racemic ketamine are related to the pre - existing cerebrovascular tone induced by background anaesthetics .    2.077711295078919
UNK - fever is a UNK transmitted viral disease .    2.7703699621218743
it is endemic mainly in south - east asia and UNK .    2.1548477187821415
the clinical manifestation is divided into different stages .    2.553297005496005
ocular manifestations in UNK have been rarely reported .    2.9012244747494087
sufficient and regular wetting of the cornea with a normal preocular tear film is an essential requirement for the accurate visual functioning of the eye .    2.1976775690546475
multiple factors may cause tear film instability .    2.489646398168683
measuring the break - up time of the preocular tear film is a necessary , clinically reliable means for evaluating tear film stability .    2.3123288144478087
we designed a new instrument to observe the preocular tear film at high magnification which can contribute to the in vivo imaging of the physiological and pathophysiological dynamics of the tear film and its break - up phenomena .    2.23288783820785
the prevalence of hepatitis b , hepatitis c and hiv infections among drug abuse - related fatalities in hamburg ( 1985 - 1997 ) was investigated with respect to epidemiological , forensic and morphological aspects .    2.174355088099485
the purpose of this study was ( 1 ) to determine the prevalence of hepatitis b ( hbv ) , hepatitis c ( hcv ) and hiv infections among drug abuse - related fatalities ( drug deaths ) in hamburg from 1985 to 1997 , ( 2 ) to assess the rate of multiple infections and ( 3 ) to analyze the liver UNK in 100 autopsied drug deaths .    2.5840641095111883
furthermore , we discuss the epidemiological and forensic aspects .    2.687205233335879
in this period UNK drug deaths were registered with a prevalence for hbv of 35 % ( 1997 : 39 % ) , for hcv 51 % ( 1997 : 58 % ) , and for hiv 7 % ( 1997 : 15 % ) .    2.608921701160819
co - infections were common ( 28 % ) and 19 % of all cases were infected with hbv and hcv .    3.2390746626312237
the liver histology showed that hepatitis was frequently diagnosed ( 74 % ) and was associated with hbv and / or hcv infections ( 77 % of all hepatitis cases ) .    2.788217192640195
only 9 % showed a normal UNK .    2.8885589761317356
forensic autopsies and monitoring of hbv , hcv and hiv infections in drug deaths represent an important tool to gain information about the individual case and the situation among i . v .    2.351431079696581
background : an abnormal coronary flow reserve represents an early marker of impaired blood flow regulation in the natural history of coronary atherosclerosis under the impact of risk factors such as hypercholesterolemia .    2.3007770912315704
our clinical investigation was aimed at assessing noninvasively the integrative coronary flow response to dipyridamole stress in 18 consecutive patients with microvascular angina , only moderately elevated ldl - cholesterol levels ( 168 + / - 33 mg / dl ) , and reduced vasodilator capacity despite normal ( n = 9 ) or slightly abnormal ( n = 9 ) coronary UNK ( minimal disease with luminal irregularities and / or diameter reduction < = 30 % ) before and after 6 - month lipid - lowering therapy ( UNK ) .    2.393248010702637
methods : regional and averaged myocardial blood flow were measured at rest and after dipyridamole induced vasodilation ( 0 . 56 mg / kg ) using dynamic positron emission tomography ( pet ) and n - 13 ammonia as flow tracer related to a 3 - compartment kinetic model .    2.195497795814943
baseline data ( mean + / - sd ) : 13 males , 5 females ; mean age : 56 + / - 8 years ; basal coronary flow : 90 + / - 22 ml / minx100 g ; after lipid intervention : 93 + / - 18 ml / minx100 g ( n . s . ) .    2.42213919045023
total cholesterol decreased to 170 + / - 36 mg / dl ( p < 0 . 001 ) ; mean ldl level : 97 + / - 26 mg / dl ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    2.435691944190431
coronary dilator capacity increased , assessed in terms of minimal coronary resistance : 0 . 38 + / - 0 . 08 vs 0 . 49 + / - 0 . 09 units at baseline ( p < 0 . 01 ) , myocardial blood flow under dipyridamole : UNK + / - 43 vs 186 + / - 37 ml / minx100 g at baseline ( p < 0 . 01 ) , and instantaneous flow ratio : 2 . 6 + / - 0 . 7 vs 2 . 2 + / - 0 . 6 ( p = 0 . 06 ) .    2.7524741132882733
concomitantly , a considerable regression of angina was noticed in the majority of patients .    2.575830631920467
conclusions : an improvement of the non - invasively determined integrative dipyridamole induced coronary vasodilator capacity may be achieved after 6 months by intensive lipid lowering at a very early stage of coronary atherosclerosis .    2.3901643277700573
we report the case of a a 60 year - old worker in the pharmaceutical industry who suffered from recurring contact dermatitis .    2.409116376916355
initially the contact dermatitis was limited to the hands ; later on it became generalized .    2.277059813102434
the patient had been working on a drug filling line in a pharmaceutical plant for more than 20 years .    2.2372031637842675
eight years after starting this job he had developed allergic hand dermatitis to 2 , 6 - diaminopyridine ( patch test positive ) ; this healed upon cessation of exposure .    1.9762267284577777
ten years later he again developed hand dermatitis which progressed to generalized dermatitis and conjunctivitis .    2.1056255436117985
four months after returning to work , the patient experienced a first episode of severe asthma and generalized dermatitis with conjunctivitis following exposure to hydroxychloroquine the day before .    2.242684165416649
the asthma and dermatitis improved after systemic corticosteroid therapy and stopping work .    2.1027494118746044
his condition continued to UNK , when though the patient was transferred at work and now UNK rubber gloves .    2.4978657089811143
eight months later he again developed a generalized dermatitis .    2.5107508188935235
patch testing revealed delayed - type UNK to hydroxychloroquine ( tested in concentrations of 0 . 1 % , 0 . 5 % , 1 % and 2 % ) .    3.0481154055738835
equivalent tests in five healthy volunteers were negative .    2.408102143675554
the patch test reactions were pustular , while a biopsy was interpreted as a multiform contact dermatitis reaction .    2.195918813614676
bronchial exposure with hydroxychloroquine dust produced a delayed bronchial obstruction over the next 20 hours , which progressed to fever and generalized erythema ( hematogenous contact dermatitis ) .    1.9060051605234887
after removing exposure to 2 , 6 - diaminopyridine and hydroxychloroquine , the patient went on to develop a contact dermatitis to latex ( patch test positive ) .    2.3213024446025736
hydroxychloroquine is well known to cause drug reactions .    2.9109583271807637
to our knowledge , contact dermatitis to this substance has not yet been reported .    2.414790447405039
it is noteworthy that the patch test reactions were pustular and of multiform morphology and that bronchial exposure to the allergen resulted in asthma and a generalized drug reaction .    1.8894231976051563
pathogenetically the asthmatic reaction seems to be on a delayed - type mechanism as is also seen with ampicillin , cobalt and nickel induced asthma .    2.2168259924001372
a 45 years old female UNK developed a bilateral tendinopathy of the achilles tendon after repeated antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin .    2.1959861260729
one month later the right achilles tendon ruptured without any sudden pain .    2.1641123531732025
mri revealed degenerative changes of the left achilles tendon ; on the right side the tendon was ruptured with a dehiscence of 4 cm between both ends of the tendon .    2.728905825992303
the tendon was reconstructed surgically .    2.759187462382355
the histological analysis showed cystic changes with focal necrosis .    2.377314060711902
this finding differ from findings in non drug induced UNK .    2.2506169736530235
after antimicrobiotical treatment with ciprofloxacin the side effect of a tendon disorder must be considered .    2.49123171956125
the impairment of the tendon may be as strong that a tendon rupture may occur at daily living activities without any typical clinical symptoms .    2.337594169868916
the recent results obtained from investigations based on molecular biological techniques have led to a better understanding of recurrent genetic causes important for the pathogenesis of tumors .    2.6982794165438655
several genes have been identified as being involved in the development of cancer .    3.5479844140313297
in many cases , the activation of oncogenes or the inactivation of tumor - suppressor genes is the predominant reason for UNK cell transformation .    2.288342526108582
functional dysregulation is frequently the consequence of mutations , resulting in an alteration of the primary structure of the dna .    2.9221712153636843
as our understanding of the nature , function , and interaction of these genes UNK , new opportunities for early diagnosis , classification , prevention , and treatment of malignant tumors will arise .    2.6734023692567037
the present report summarizes the current molecular biological aspects of several oncogenes ( UNK , ras , myc , UNK , fos , jun , bcl , mdm 2 , UNK , kit UNK , met ) and tumor suppressor genes ( p 53 , UNK , mts ) involved in lung - cancer development with respect to the pathology of lung tumors , including the importance of these genes as far as the clinical course of the disease is concerned .    2.680744157524927
hyperbaric oxygen ( hbo ) therapy is a kind of medical treatment in which a patient UNK 100 % of oxygen inside a pressure chamber while the pressure of the chamber is increased to a point higher than sea level pressure .    2.3042645661406467
it is strongly based on clearly defined physical laws and physiological UNK .    2.1124379534540085
for the clinical use of hbo therapy , according to international recommendations , there are several commonly accepted indications in which hbo either is the only causative life - saving kind of treatment , or is an essential and UNK decisive component of a comprehensive interdisciplinary intensive care therapy .    2.265893507671111
among potential adverse effects , UNK of the lungs and especially oxygen toxicity to the central nervous system have to be mentioned .    3.396529007314437
clinical use of hbo therefore requires special knowledge of its effects , risks , and adverse effects , a clear and distinct indication , and the ability and skills to keep complications under control by means of intensive care or emergency medical measures .    2.5080351036725097
the clinical use of hyperbaric oxygen with its interdisciplinary - like character of emergency medicine or intensive care therapy therefore should be an additional , most interesting field of activity for the anaesthesiologist .    2.176071599986259
although arthroscopy of the ankle joint has been well established , there are only very few reports about arthroscopy in ankle fracture treatment .    2.5956741529717835
in order to UNK analyze the intraarticular lesions of ankle fractures , we assessed 196 consecutive ankle fractures immediately before orif .    2.1093534529922247
there were 94 male and 101 female patients with an average age of 47 . 8 years ( 16 - 88 years ) .    2.6139249272488083
there were more cartilage lesions found than expected , and cartilage lesions were not noted more frequently in type c - fractures than in type b - fractures .    2.328288022331441
in both fracture types , an increasing amount of cartilage lesions was found from group 1 to 3 .    2.5259249534432326
in addition , more ligament injuries were found than expected , especially in the b . 1 - and b . 2 - fractures .    2.766956139798473
successful arthroscopic surgery was performed in 26 cases : internal fixation , 9 ; loose body removal , 7 ; ligament reposition , 5 ; cartilage UNK , 4 ; and cartilage fracture repair , 1 .    2.2430677198061786
in one case , a UNK flap could not be reduced , and in another case , the internal fixation of the medial malleolus was not stable .    3.2789706799662537
in summary , arthroscopy was shown to be a very helpful diagnostic tool in ankle fractures .    2.75045469807225
as long - term results are not yet available , it remains , however , unclear as to whether arthroscopy may improve the success of the following orif .    3.2658616524475033
arthroscopy was also shown to be a successful tool for several closed surgical procedures .    2.6890214358450457
of these , percutaneous internal fixation of the medial malleolus under arthroscopic view may be an excellent indication .    2.778259832256829
objective : UNK adaption of the two most widely used and accepted functional indices in ankylosing spondylitis , the bath ankylosing spondylitis functional index ( basfi ) and UNK functional index ( d - fi ) .    2.2145723657283187
methods : the instruments were translated and tested for internal consistency ( cronbach ' s coefficient alpha ) , test - retest reliability ( UNK correlation coefficient , icc ) , construct validity ( testing for association with UNK ' s test , finger floor distance , occiput wall distance , frequency and duration of awakenings at night , and a visual analog scale pain ) , and responsiveness ( standardized response mean , srm ) .    2.003892590381028
results : the study sample consisted of 72 patients of a randomized , controlled clinical trial receiving either diclofenac or placebo .    2.3778608590987553
visual assessment of distribution patterns revealed a UNK effect of both instruments .    2.8414890376987483
both questionnaires had a high internal consistency ( cronbach alpha : 0 . 81 [ basfi ] , 0 . 85 [ d - fi ] and a high test - retest reliability ( icc : 0 . 92 [ basfi ] , 0 . 89 [ d - fi ] ) .    2.042004202005149
the limited responsiveness to diclofenac treatment ( srm : 0 . 46 [ basfi ] , 0 . 33 [ d - fi ] ) may be related to the selected study sample .    2.328332131493765
the basfi was significantly correlated with all tested validation parameters .    2.381077021750998
the d - fi was only significantly correlated with finger floor distance , occiput wall distance , and duration of awakenings at night .    2.1186715906873146
conclusion : the UNK adapted version of both functional indices are valid , reliable , and internally consistent .    2.103804088505386
because of psychometric advantages , the basfi may be preferred in clinical trial settings .    2.286864117529281
the role of radiotherapy of the pelvic lymphatic pathways in patients with node positive prostate cancer remains uncertain .    2.8765606002148565
interpretation of the few prospective studies ( UNK 75 - 06 and 77 - 06 ) is hampered by severe UNK in the study design .    2.7446143373167993
data on longterm side - effects are only available from older studies with UNK radiation techniques .    2.463176288415597
according to more recent studies short term side effects are considerably higher with radiation of the pelvic lymphatics when compared with radiation of the prostate alone .    2.585010096927976
in summary radiation of the lymphatic pathways in lymph node positive prostate cancer cannot currently be considered as standard treatment and should be carried out within clinical studies .    2.568713491020793
in reconstruction of cartilage defects , autogenous transplantation is known as a reliable and experienced method .    2.39413629269819
although a clinical application has not been reported until now , tissue engineering permits in vitro production of autogenous cartilage transplants .    2.3942763439902865
nevertheless , in both methods the cartilage is exposed to individually varying resorptive mechanisms .    2.3372970001697473
among other methods for in vivo tissue protection , the encapsulation with a UNK polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could guarantee sufficient protection against resorptive influences .    2.250228503050462
human septal cartilage was encapsulated ( group 1 ) with polyelectrolytecomplex membranes and subcutaneously implanted on the back of UNK nude mice .    2.1908271932000805
cartilage implants without encapsulation ( group 2 ) were used as control .    2.7696695354614262
scanning electron microscopy and histochemical investigations were performed 1 , 4 , 8 , 12 and 16 weeks after implantation .    2.5621841218726216
group 1 showed no signs of resorption and chronic inflammation at all .    2.5441182702881115
in contrast , group 2 presented , correlating to the time of UNK - tion , increasing signs of cell death and fibrotic transformation , representing an increased activity of resorption .    2.3799516612955656
in conclusion , tissue encapsulation with a polyelectrolytecomplex membrane could ensure a sufficient protection of human cartilage transplants from resorptive influences .    1.9837184102735783
for the plastic - reconstructive surgeon the desired result becomes more calculable .    2.244417998613449
subjective time - experience and objective time - estimation were examined in 20 endogenous , 20 neurotic depressives , and 15 healthy volunteers .    2.182625897954538
subjective experience of past and anticipated future time was more extended in both depressive groups than in healthy controls .    2.0208228115891576
objective time estimation differed between depressives and controls concerning relatively long time spans whereas very short time spans were correctly estimated also by depressives .    1.8728700830417702
there were no significant differences between endogenous and neurotic depressives .    2.237185755562781
the perception of extended time normalized during treatment .    2.436218148909247
the depressives ' time perception , differences correlated with the extent of depressive psychopathological symptoms and - to a lesser degree - with retardation .    2.345060445869484
the findings support the hypotheses of anthropological phenomenology concerning disturbed time perception and estimation in depressives .    2.037758570407606
amelioration of experienced time - extension in intentionally structured time spans compared to empty time spans suggests psychotherapeutic consequences in the sense of UNK .    1.9296405140037685
in a retrospective analysis , the UNK of free psa was determined in the sera of 35 patients with histologically proven benign prostatic hyperplasia ( bph ) and 35 patients with clinically localized cap .    2.7252293014222513
patients with urolithiasis ( n = 33 ) served as a control group .    2.793010319341453
serum levels of free psa and total psa were determined employing a UNK enzyme immunoassay .    2.4693572327198403
determination of the percentage of free psa enhances the differentiation between bph and cap and may reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in patients with an elevated psa .    3.105299608376974
confirmation of our preliminary results is required .    2.6824354827276387
psychological problems in children and parents related to children ' s atopic eczema ( UNK ) may impede the success of treatment .    2.843477790023451
we studied the question , if behavior - based parental education in groups ( UNK ) or standardized video - education ( UNK ) could enhance dermatological treatment effects and reduce skin - damaging behaviors in children and stress in their mothers .    2.4155227091340072
sevoflurane UNK in co2 absorbents to produce compound a , which may have hepatotoxic potential in humans .    2.3571294973631463
several recent studies in human volunteers have been performed to evaluate this potential .    2.6637400316954607
three studies have evaluated sevoflurane administered to volunteers using a 3 % concentration for 8 h duration at approximately 2 l / min flow rate .    2.054919422621844
the initial investigation found high excretion of protein , glucose and renal tubular enzymes in the urine of the volunteers receiving sevoflurane .    2.0649384127978765
subsequent investigations using identical protocols found more minor or absent changes in excretion of these markers .    2.008979746834413
one additional investigation in volunteers studied 3 % sevoflurane anesthesia for 4 h duration using a low - flow ( 1 l / min ) technique .    2.4869994401296482
no significant excretion of protein , glucose or renal enzymes was observed .    2.160868271896478
application of these results to clinical practice must be interpreted in light of the experimental nature of the anesthetic administration .    2.8229412586399776
although some controversy remains , these data , combined with results of recent studies in surgical patients , suggest that renal function following modest duration low - flow sevoflurane anesthesia is similar to that following isoflurane anesthesia .    2.411169182457711
background : the microbial colonization of the intestinal tract in newborns begins during delivery .    2.1424336566656748
streptococci and UNK coli pave the way for the UNK dominance typical in breast - fed newborns .    2.410604013993201
they provide optimal living conditions for anaerobic bifidobacteria by withdrawal of intraluminal oxygen .    2.009230837053415
a mixed intestinal flora is established on infant formula feeding in the infant .    2.134011220616763
bifidobacteria , UNK , UNK , streptococci and UNK are the main UNK of this mixed intestinal flora .    3.8460385459847
this represents an intermediate stage of the microflora in adults .    2.4676343400925664
the UNK effect of mothers ' milk is based on the active substances it contains , which selectively enhance the growth of bifidobacteria , whereas other active substances suppress the growth of the accompanying flora .    2.405306149071603
bifidus - enhancing factors in breast - feeding are UNK , UNK , glycoproteins such as UNK and the inoculation with bifidobacteria deriving from the skin surface of the mother .    3.021354325466925
factors directed to the suppression of the accompanying microflora are antibodies , lactoferrin , lysozyme , fatty acids and UNK that act as antimicrobial substances and the comparatively low protein and iron content in mothers ' milk .    1.931562851141655
a bifidus - inhibiting colonization of the intestinal tract with pathogenic germs is caused by maternal birth - canal infections , which are now known to be the most frequent reason for premature births .    2.5187635006256026
an increasing number of surgical deliveries , the separation of the newborn infant from its mother , and the generous use of antibiotics contribute to the delayed colonization of bifidobacteria and to the development of life - threatening nosocomial infections .    2.9533134739356277
UNK measures against this disastrous situation are the preferential use of bifidobacteria - preserving antibiotics and the inoculation of lyophilized bifidobacteria .    1.950790408489355
between january 1983 and december 1987 , metatarsal head - resections were performed on 203 patients , comprising a total of UNK feet , using the UNK / mayo and hoffmann procedure .    2.285422607018772
seventy - two patients , comprising a total of 126 feet , were available for post - operative review after an average of 11 . 4 years from the date of the original operations .    2.842880522065454
the information obtained from standardized questionnaires was compared to the information found in each patient ' s file .    3.036074621760062
in addition , every available pre - and post - operative x - ray taken from 1983 to 1987 was analyzed .    2.3314658084060667
thus , with an average follow - up period of 5 . 6 years , the changes found in the pre - and post - operative x - rays from a total of 183 feet could be compared .    3.200713214092893
before the operations , nearly 100 % of the examined feet suffered from painful synovial hypertrophy and erosion of the metatarsophalangeal joints with dislocation and subluxation , causing approximately 70 % of all patients to have great difficulties in walking .    2.3345660789083262
after the operations , however , 90 . 2 % of the patients reported that this condition had UNK improved or had completely disappeared .    3.004682808201073
in fact , 87 . 5 % of all patients reported a lasting improvement in their ability to walk longer distances .    2.6113381653615715
as the main criteria in determining the success of an operation ( namely , the noticeable reduction of pain and increased mobility ) were achieved in 87 . 5 % of the patients , we consider the metatarsal head - resection a reliable method of correcting forefoot deformities in rheumatoid arthritis .    2.606898970534439
bone metabolism is influenced by systemic and local acting UNK .    2.6320102470511717
bone morphogenetic proteins ( bmps ) as representatives of the latter substances are known to have the ability for ectopic bone formation .    2.4146258277597727
within this study , we investigated the influence of different growth factors on the proliferation - and differentiation rate of osteoblast - like cells .    2.7626277080329738
for that purpose , human osteoblast - like cells ( hpoc ) were incubated in the presence of either recombinant bmp - 4 of the genome of xenopus laevis ( rxbmp - 4 ) , recombinant human bmp 2 ( rhbmp - 2 ) , transforming growth factor - ß ( tgf - ß ) or basic fibroblast growth factor ( rh - bfgf ) in two different concentrations each ( 10 ng / ml and 50 ng / ml ) .    2.047860117449888
UNK - bmp - 4 induced a differentiation of hpoc to almost the same extent as rhbmp - 2 , whereas the addition of rh - bfgf , applied at the same concentration , failed to have any influence on cell differentiation .    2.3319032852726633
however , rh - bfgf provoked an increase in cell proliferation when compared with UNK hpoc , while rhbmp - 2 and rxbmp - 4 showed no effect on proliferation .    2.3660504269991343
tgf - ß influenced bone proliferation as well as UNK significantly .    2.9562630893808346
the equipotent effect of recombinant human bmp - 2 and recombinant bmp - 4 obtained from xenopus laevis with regard to differentiation and proliferation of human primary osteoblast - like cells originates either in the fact that target cells have receptors for bmp 2 as well as bmp 4 , or that both bmp ' s link to the same receptor with almost the same affinity .    2.1550496154018863
sonography has provided an important addition to the tools available for the diagnosis of the soft tissues in the head and neck region .    2.9760004970598843
the ent surgeon himself is able to examine pathological formations by this quick , non - invasive and , last but not least , less expensive method .    2.2998923199426016
due to the high resolution of the procedure the chance of detecting even small changes is increased and the UNK of diagnosis of pathological lymph nodes of the neck has been significantly improved compared to palpation alone .    2.591244721618634
ultrasound has replaced the UNK procedures in the field of diagnostic evaluation of salivary gland disease in the daily practice except for special indications .    2.726910274287484
after inauguration of color doppler sonography non - invasive evaluation of vascular stenosis of the large cervical vessels concerning their hemodynamic effects has become possible .    2.363363578616184
this issue is important for the differential UNK of otoneurological diseases such as sudden hearing loss , vertigo and tinnitus .    2.402087705274172
additionally , the extent of perfusion of space - occupying lesions can be easily examined , and therefore the risk of mass bleeding can be preoperatively assessed by this method without harm to the patient .    2.588009475747138
especially carotid body tumors may be diagnosed with high accuracy by the evidence of significant diffuse perfusion of the lesion .    2.3949101477541097
however , other authors have shown inconsistent results in differentiation of benign and malignant UNK ; therefore , final judgment does not seem to be possible yet .    2.29215489091596
use of echo - contrast agents to enhance the ultrasound signal seems to be a promising approach for future developments in color doppler imaging .    2.399324133534597
painful stiffness of the shoulder is an ill - defined clinical entity that is difficult to assess and delicate to treat .    2.590300062231087
the nomenclature used is broad and includes terms such as frozen shoulder , adhesive UNK , focal UNK , stiff shoulder , contracted shoulder , and others .    1.8408551302127696
apart from its idiopathic form , the disease can be initiated by trauma , infection , tumour , radiation , systemic and local metabolic disturbances .    2.3797926650724825
UNK , the common UNK is an inflammatory vascular proliferation followed by thickening , scarring , and retraction of the joint capsule .    2.3883880693058046
the inflammatory process often starts at the rotator interval and may extend to the subacromial space .    2.115999278531174
the prognosis for patients in whom metastatic renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) is not treated is unfavorable , with a reported 5 - year survival of 0 - 18 % .    2.710370744100466
before the era of immunotherapy and in the absence of effective nonsurgical therapy , resection of metastases was the accepted way to prolong survival , giving a 5 - year survival of 7 - 69 % .    2.4780314226179425
retrospective studies have shown that several clinical factors are associated with a relatively good prognosis .    2.8661188644890174
some patients will benefit from resection of metastases , but most patients with metastatic rcc are not candidates for such aggressive surgery .    2.3406057958455313
the use of interleukin - 2 has demonstrated that immunotherapy can produce durable remissions .    2.37836310516139
without randomized trials , it is difficult to know whether survival is longer than that in untreated patients , but there is clear evidence that immunotherapy improves survival and yields long - lasting remissions in selected patients .    2.485966716990584
many questions remain concerning quality of life and the benefit - to - risk ratio of immunotherapy , but it is the most effective treatment for metastatic rcc .    2.9701860182263
after loss of active glenohumeral motion the arm cannot be positioned in space and function is impaired .    2.141198002176249
the use of the reconstructive plate makes the operation easier .    2.39939818988904
shoulder fusion is especially suited if the function of elbow and hand is well preserved and if the patient is UNK active .    2.562626959945266
but fusion is definite and the options of muscle transfer operations and above elbow amputation have to be considered .    2.2236838560043632
the unreamed femoral nail ( ufn ) system , with its numerous proximal interlocking options , allows a minimal invasive surgical procedure for the treatment of nearly all femoral fracture patterns .    2.3522456068787974
sixty - six fractures , 5 cases of osteolysis or pathologic fractures , 2 limb UNK and 1 lengthening ( UNK technique ) and 3 cases of pseudarthrosis were stabilised with the ufn from july 1994 to december 1996 .    2.0660830629301468
the fractures were analysed according to the ao classification .    2.969320620067187
we found 31 polytrauma patients with an mean iss of 21 . 8 and a mean pts of 25 . 4 .    2.6116021246510632
most of the multiply injured patients ( n = 26 ) were stabilised with the ufn primarily .    2.6244950656997292
follow - up of 44 patients ranged from 4 to 18 months postoperatively .    2.568645564241612
according to our clinical and radiological score the results were excellent in 34 % of cases , good in 36 . 3 % , poor in 20 . 4 % and bad in 9 % .    3.027338461669527
average fracture healing time was about 9 . 8 weeks .    2.770854110757006
fractures of the atlas account for 1 - 2 % of all vertebral fractures .    3.4906164182671815
we divide atlas fractures into 5 groups : isolated fractures of the anterior arch of the atlas , isolated fractures of the posterior arch , combined fractures of the anterior and posterior arch ( so - called jefferson fractures ) , isolated fractures of the lateral mass and fractures of the transverse process .    2.7220757159045874
isolated fractures of the anterior or posterior arch are benign and are treated conservatively with a soft collar until the neck pain has disappeared .    2.468117743113306
jefferson fractures are divided into stable and unstable fracture depending on the integrity of the transverse ligament .    2.7843146134793098
stable jefferson fractures are treated conservatively with good outcome while unstable jefferson fractures are probably best treated operatively with a posterior atlanto - axial or occipito - axial stabilization and fusion .    2.056412920933808
the authors preferred treatment modality is the immediate open reduction of the dislocated lateral masses combined with a stabilization in the reduced position using a transarticular screw fixation c1 / c2 according to magerl .    2.1491604452993593
this has the advantage of saving the atlanto - occipital joints and offering an immediate stability which makes immobilization in an halo or UNK cast UNK .    1.9654437569670378
in late instabilities c1 / 2 with UNK of the lateral masses occurring after primary conservative treatment , an occipito - cervical fusion is indicated .    2.639185963183545
isolated fractures of the lateral masses are very rare and may , if the lateral mass is totally destroyed , be a reason for an occipito - cervical fusion .    2.5061180239949046
fractures of the transverse processes may be the cause for a thrombosis of the vertebral artery .    3.229105128015992
no treatment is necessary for the fracture itself .    3.037434078455671
reported is the case of a 36 - year - old man with neurofibromatosis type 1 with lethal haemorrhage from rupture of the left common iliac artery .    2.822298818976218
histologically and immunohistochemically , no hints on UNK as a possible cause of bleeding were detected .    2.483726276220441
considering the literature and the histological findings in the area of rupture , a local weakness of the vascular wall caused by the UNK UNK UNK was most probably the reason for bleeding .    3.675336377176241
we report on a 2 - year - old girl with chronic bullous disease of childhood ( cbdc ) .    2.3339386705227954
following antibiotic treatment with UNK p . o .    2.9011290253111843
direct immunofluorescence revealed a linear iga deposition along the basement membrane zone , confirming the diagnosis of cbdc .    2.2911395984201475
these lesions cleared rapidly after treatment with dapsone p . o .    2.521710773912563
this case prompted us to consider new aspects of the pathogenesis , clinical entity and treatment of this rare bullous disease of childhood .    2.6886026713333746
systemic administration of strontium - 89 is an important option for pain relief in advanced prostate carcinoma with multiple osseous metastases .    2.4408092385987405
recently , rhenium - 186 - hedp was introduced as a new substance which has important advantages ( shorter physical half - life , scintigraphic imaging , dose distribution ) .    1.9969266594822572
the myelosuppressive effect can be estimated more accurately in advance , so that adverse effects can be reduced and the treatment can be repeated after a shorter period of time and more often .    2.566755492495219
our study comprises 15 treatments with rhenium - 186 - hedp in advanced prostate cancer patients using the 1 . 4 - to 2 - fold standard dose .    2.2130097653803333
the response rate , estimated as reduction in pain and increase in patient mobility , was 87 % with no major myelosuppressive effects .    2.052805768877495
the mean duration of pain relief was 4 - 6 weeks .    2.9863738666540622
all four patients with repeated therapy were also UNK to the second treatment .    2.9090534182323897
radionuclide therapy for painful osseous metastases with rhenium - 186 - hedp appears to be an effective and , even at higher doses , safe procedure .    2.326859689697058
cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosuppressive drug which is widely used to treat renal and central nervous system manifestation of systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .    2.3033458813127394
it is employed especially to prevent renal failure in lupus nephritis .    2.2586039730625482
within the last decade intravenous cyclophosphamide bolus therapy has become the standard therapy in severe sle due to its tendency towards a higher efficacy and fewer side effects as compared to oral application .    2.486781835802907
studies on the slightly more cost - effective oral cyclophosphamide bolus therapy have recently been published , however , there are no data on long - term results yet .    2.821005853730942
here , we review the effects and side effects of cyclophosphamide as well as recent clinical studies on cyclophosphamide bolus therapy in sle .    2.991819070833321
because of the possible side effects , especially the high risk of malignancies , which UNK increases at a cumulative dose of approximately 60g , cyclophosphamide should be used cautiously .    2.9280869597442227
the optimal time to perform acute acl reconstruction with respect to arthrofibrosis is discussed .    2.841391352768774
the definition of the term " acute " varies between 48 hours and 4 weeks .    2.434546609900157
in this study the limit was set at 60 hours .    2.2680826926114666
acute acl reconstruction was performed in 39 patients and delayed surgery in 35 after they had regained full rom .    2.617503680192789
the incidence of arthrofibrosis was not higher in the acutely operated group whereas overall inability to work was 44 % lower in this population .    2.2410105269851637
when the indication is clear , we think that acute acl reconstruction may be performed within 60 hours without a higher risk of postoperative development of arthrofibrosis .    2.3964969022382405
nowadays , this strategy should also be considered for economic reasons .    2.782412428897916
after some introductory remarks on the influence of psychosocial risk factors on the developmental outcome of premature infants this review summarizes the current knowledge about intervention programs for UNK and their parents with a special focus on parent - centered programs .    2.3774524386676004
positive effects of intervention programs are found in an improvement of cognitive development , parental sensitivity and the home environment .    2.589994838515342
only parent - centered interventions enhanced the quality of parent - infant interaction .    2.6176615719028344
it is questioned if those effects are also reliable for very premature infants and are found in the long term .    2.345952920746044
further programs should focus on parent - and parent - infant centered interventions .    2.251983080400491
methodological problems of intervention studies and further research perspectives on parent - centered interventions are discussed .    2.195468390459111
the surgical therapy of the rupture of a distal biceps tendon and a modified postoperative treatment is described .    2.5563731908428737
UNK is the early treatment in UNK of UNK as it is standardized in the treatment of ruptures of the flexor tendons of the hand .    3.2931985507455943
a forearm orthesis with a simply rom - joint without UNK was used .    2.17444565749276
possible benefits are shown and further industrial evolution seems to be indicated .    2.624485506575338
matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) and their tissue inhibitors ( UNK ) are involved in important processes of tumor invasion and metastasis .    2.686822353611113
in the study presented , matrix metalloproteinase 1 ( mmp1 ) and 3 ( mmp3 ) , the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 ( timp1 ) and the complex mmp1 / timp1 were measured by elisa tests specific for these proteins in blood plasma .    2.276369727929289
these components have been investigated in prostate cancer patients ( pca ) with metastases ( n = 18 ; t2 , 3 , 4 pn1 , UNK ) , prostate cancer patients without metastases ( n = 29 ; t2 , 3 UNK ) , patients with benign prostate hyperplasia ( bph ; n = 29 ) and in healthy men ( n = 35 ) .    2.967723076765566
mean values of mmp1 and of the complex mmp1 / timp1 were not different among the four groups .    2.3937918583548012
the mean values of mmp3 and especially timp1 were significantly higher in prostate cancer patients with metastases compared with controls , bph patients and prostate cancer patients without metastases .    2.2251036577958248
ten of these 18 patients had timp1 levels higher than the upper reference limit .    2.3185391957829564
timp1 concentrations correlate to the tumor stage but not to the tumor grade .    2.65599246884646
these results indicate , that timp1 could be an potential marker for metastases in prostate cancer patients .    2.1816208886274704
the interventional occlusion of atrial septal defects still represents an experimental approach .    2.247139634573526
as in all intracardiac implants able the double umbrella device ( asdos ) is affected by late complications , particularly when involving umbrella thrombosis and umbrella dislocations .    1.9749801985779456
the demonstration of 4 case reports shows that late postinterventional complications can manifest in unspecific cardial and noncardial symptoms in patients with an asdos device .    2.3907336042727825
the diagnosis of a late complication was in all cases confirmed by transesophageal echocardiography and represents an indication for immediate surgical explantation .    2.5583593435297893
for early diagnosis and safe handling of late complications after asdos implantation the knowledge of the emergency physician about UNK problems of this device is essential .    2.5987664408929465
every asdos patient who is suspected of suffering from late postinterventional complications should undergo immediate transesophageal echocardiography .    2.1146185177641663
the emergency physician should get in touch with the implantation center immediately .    2.2626994175722044
furthermore , the concept of interventional occlusion therapy of atrial septum defects needs further development to avoid late complications .    2.228477321433278
the goal of UNK resuscitation is to return to the pre - arrest level of neurological function and to reintegrate the patient into his former social circumstances .    2.0654777782465548
this study evaluated the long - term outcome of patients with out - of - hospital cardiac arrests in a country - area .    2.8567869446482
the economic burden of congestive heart failure is significant .    2.615573987274386
approximately 1 to 2 % of total health care expenditure is attributed to the diagnosis , treatment and prevention of congestive heart failure .    2.8013708309154666
a great share of this expenditure is related to the costs of long - term complications and productivity losses .    2.8118783096871756
in order to manage these costs , providers and UNK increasingly have to focus on UNK attractive interventions .    2.1041004005373676
teleconsultation is a consultation between two or more physicians about the diagnostic work - up and therapeutic strategy in the treatment of an individual case by means of modern telematics .    2.7443062602817134
rapid technical improvements in telematics will progressively facilitate the practical performance of teleconsultation ( based upon an UNK network in the beginning , later on by the use of a national health network ) .    2.150222597260677
the medicolegal aspects of teleconsultation have already been defined sufficiently for use in surgery .    2.318963294366663
however , the question of adequate financial compensation for this type of medical service is still unclear .    2.5226159818720997
3 . 5 million inhabitants ) were contacted in march 1997 and asked to cooperate .    2.4412577817184613
an 18 - point questionnaire was sent out to record the physician ' s experience with atraumatic and posttraumatic neck complaints , which was returned by only 112 ( 25 % ) .    2.3731103491357786
47 000 atraumatic patients with cervical complaints and ca .    2.2872826391924863
UNK with a history of a UNK trauma over a 12 - month - period ( 1996 ) .    3.2037070050947465
all responders had treated patients with posttraumatic complaints ; about 60 % stated having treated between 20 and 60 patients per year , 25 % a smaller and 15 % a greater number of patients .    2.272930200344295
the average treatment time was stated to be 2 - 5 weeks by 60 % of the physicians , 10 % listed a peak of 6 - 7 weeks and another 10 % in excess of this peak .    2.4803566080910024
half of the physicians stated having also treated patients with a cervical trauma not caused by another person ( a total of 500 cases ) .    3.075173952308334
symptoms / findings were considered as specific for a traumatic origin by ca .    2.201656152813414
50 % of the physicians and as nonspecific by the other half .    2.964894408894997
it is noteworthy that the physician ' s point of view was influenced by personal accident experience ( accident as a car UNK ) : 54 % of the 26 physicians with posttraumatic cervical complaints considered these symptoms to be UNK compared to only 35 % of 40 physicians with accidents but without cervical symptoms .    2.1780906040765884
the statement that financial gains are frequently a motivating factor for patients that influenced the symptoms and course was confirmed by 22 % of the physicians without accident experience compared to 62 % of the physicians with accidents without cervical involvement .    2.3643044895688887
of the physicians 32 % were already familiar with personal cervical complaints in middle age unrelated to trauma and another 18 % considered them sometimes a disease parameter .    2.003721689940763
the " subject physician " in the context of " whiplash injury " is not yet sufficiently investigated but seems to be an interesting topic of further research .    2.5572976876106956
to measure dilation of large retinal branch vessels .    2.335676525067123
the paper UNK of the many psychiatrists , neurologists , and pathologists connected with scientific work in neuropathology who were expelled from germany between 1933 and 1939 because of UNK by the nuremberg laws or because of their political opposition .    2.2401931768739303
many of these colleagues saw their only way out as suicide .    2.195097110953337
short UNK give an orientation about the destiny of the expelled physicians in their host countries .    2.086895597787207
the effort made after 1945 to give these emigrated colleagues again an adaequate position in germany have not been very intensive .    2.00914417768764
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) is used as a diagnostic tool for special indications in oral and maxillofacial surgery .    2.5458167703241235
we describe a new mri technique that presents images in a panoramic view analogous to UNK .    1.9968245841379448
this technique is based on three - dimensional t1 - and t2 - weighted sequences .    2.974448790729086
the familiar panoramic view in mri provides better orientation and makes diagnosis faster and easier .    1.9970361396358098
however , the acquisition time is long ( 6 - 12 min per sequence ) , with a correspondingly high risk of motion artifacts .    2.5703270937478164
moreover , the final workup is also time - consuming .    2.3731922881445913
these restrictions could be overcome by progress in hardware and software .    2.1584098863242738
there are promising indications for dental mri .    2.376105625894257
during recent years home ventilation has been shown to be useful for a growing number of patients with neuromuscular diseases and respiratory insufficiency caused by weakness of the respiratory muscles .    2.8480942654321018
despite its technical simplicity , home ventilation leads to a number of social , ethical , medical and UNK problems .    2.6651412978904943
this consensus paper discusses the special situation of patients with neuromuscular diseases in home ventilation and describes the current UNK in the following topics : ( 1 ) definition of home ventilation ; ( 2 ) aims of home ventilation ; ( 3 ) indications and preconditions of home ventilation ; ( 4 ) techniques and forms of home ventilatory support ; ( 5 ) preparation for and practical questions of home ventilation ; ( 6 ) stopping home ventilation .    2.4097869144608586
pseudo - obstruction of the colon is characterized by a massive colonic dilatation without mechanical obstruction .    2.6595020377439473
it is rarely after hip surgery , however , untreated it may be complicated by a life threatening perforation of the colon .    2.8964544851700014
in a retrospective analysis we reviewed 11 patients ( 4 women , 7 men , mean age 75 . 2 years , range 67 to 86 years ) with pseudo - obstruction of the colon after hip surgery in the years 1995 to 1998 .    2.529943408284958
in relation to all patients aged 65 years and older who underwent surgery of the hip , the prevalence was 1 . 06 % .    3.1903845715535826
the leading clinical symptom was abdominal distension .    2.3995578186742352
on plain x - rays , dilatation of the colon measured 13 . 3 cm on average ( 9 - 16 cm ) .    2.6764152667591277
in two patients ( 18 % ) adaequate application of drugs stimulating the gastro - intestinal motility was sufficient , whereas in 8 patients ( 73 % ) UNK decompression had to be performed .    2.5192117897665756
in three of these , the procedure failed and because of persistent symtoms a coecostomy was performed .    2.7324434118184473
one patient underwent immediate laparotomy because of peritonitis .    2.3302111359849036
2 patients ( 18 % ) died because of a complicated course .    2.968017505538944
in cases of failure of these procedures , perforation of the colon and / or UNK , urgent laparotomy with open decompression by a coecostomy is essential .    2.706837443786695
anti - UNK increased from year to year in nazi germany from 1933 to 1945 .    2.2009015971938943
the fear of annihilation resulted in a UNK of suicides .    3.5794325034721615
the suicides of at least 9 jewish dermatologists has been documented .    2.470740782466271
their mean age was 65 years .    2.960045326677148
couples often committed suicide together .    2.595628384993574
at the end of world war ii , the head of the dermatological department of the prague university committed suicide .    2.388829734151643
we assume the same happened in rostock and dresden .    2.1943610910022477
the president of the german dermatological society ( UNK ) committed suicide on march 27 , 1945 .    2.7589223458887395
the motives of these dermatologists were obviously the collapse of UNK and the fear of UNK measures .    2.633011090086274
UNK is a biomaterial derived from natural UNK , and it has surgical applications .    2.9114683743084813
since 1992 the author has been using this material as a bone graft substitute in maxillofacial surgery .    2.1649947707272545
seventy - seven clinical implantations were done for different indications .    2.385737001517636

background : the aim of the study was the evaluation of how ophthalmological diagnoses and the proportion of multiply handicapped children has changed within the last 20 years at a state school for visually handicapped and blind children .    2.2102963264952873
introduction : visual impairment as the initial symptom of leukemia is rare .    2.190497410563364
although retinal involvement during leukemia is frequent , a leukemic macular lesion is an exception .    2.0494529138312267
methods : included were 276 operations for first or subsequent recurrence of inguinal hernia previously treated with suture repair .    1.9144245979909493
all final repairs were carried out using the tapp technique .    2.4378545825236375
the data were collected prospectively .    2.94263018399427
the patients were examined 2 weeks and 1 year postoperatively .    2.9050645928596612
the rate of follow - up amounted to 78 . 1 % at 1 year after operation .    3.1616163692519885
results : perioperative complications were monitored prospectively and divided into intraoperative , minor and major .    2.116347657424191
the overall complication rate amounted to 9 % , major complications 5 . 3 % .    2.671406870433003
the re - recurrence rate was 0 . 4 % .    3.122773833286382
conclusions : because of the general advantages of laparoscopic surgery and the low recurrence rate we prefer laparoscopic hernioplasty using the tapp technique .    2.5256501869269385
diseases of the hindfoot are associated with considerable functional impairment and therefore may hamper patients ' movements during gait considerably .    2.4198564612524
because of biomechanical overload , articular structures , tendons and ligaments are prone to early degenerative changes during the course of rheumatic diseases as visible with plain film radiography , sonography ( us ) , or magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .    2.0855778803098435
findings may occur as arthritis of major joints or in the form of UNK and bursitis of the os calcis .    2.9364605065851106
plain film radiograms and high - resolution ultrasonography play a key role in imaging rheumatic diseases of the hindfoot .    2.606410542920155
the principal goals of diagnostic imaging are precise and reproducible documentation of morphologic abnormalities and differentiated analysis for planning proper conservative or surgical treatment .    1.9302562288514493
background : we evaluated the prevalence of the loss of visual acuity due to loss of the central portion of the visual field and UNK fixation in the first week after glaucoma filtering surgery .    2.7542306691245266
the aim of the present study was to test polylactic acid material as a controlled release carrier for polypeptide growth factors .    2.1084997172449804
basic fibroblast growth factor ( bfgf ) was incorporated into dl polylactic acid ( pla ) UNK under hyperbaric co2 pressure in two different ways .    2.056839022939368
( 2 ) lyophilized bfgf was UNK in phosphate buffer , mixed with pla granules , and UNK .    2.3807367994406916
in vitro assessment of bfgf release from the pla implants by immunoassay showed that loading of pla with crushed lyophilized bfgf resulted in a rapid and high release , while loading by UNK bfgf and UNK led to a low and more regular release of the polypeptide growth factor .    2.0406210771331765
intestinal neuronal dysplasia ( ind ) was initially described as a developmental abnormality of the submucous plexus in children .    2.1752393394592096
the aim of this study was a morphometric characterization of this disease .    2.1394827938928134
the investigation was performed with 10 adults with ind , compared with 10 healthy control probands .    2.378726186410195
the best diagnostic indicator of ind proved to be the detection of 6 - 10 giant ganglia with more than 7 nerve cells in 15 biopsy sections .    2.643925329966396
ind is an interesting cause of chronic constipation which can be histologically verified .    2.7124429488920474
extracorporal shock - wave application ( eswa ) has been used in the treatment of stones located in the kidneys , bile , pancreas and the glandula parotis .    2.3945874167784744
to date , the exact mechanism is unknown .    2.362123894766482
local hyperemia following damage or afferent inhibition is discussed .    2.1847751126306156
the possibilities and indications of eswa with respect to several syndroms are presented .    2.5446067884178447
the results show the benefit of eswa in the treatment of chronic soft - tissue disorders without severe side effects .    2.6587288674274747
some patients showed small subcutaneous hematomas and erosion of the skin when energies about 20 mj were used .    2.2474121257681667
in only 13 of 84 cases was the treatment unsuccessful .    2.29698200020294
up to now there are no facts concerning the loosening rate of the cemented titanium stem ( UNK ) .    2.3669051855316647
the central guiding UNK and the longitudinal drilled stem shall ensure a symmetric cement UNK .    2.3949390912639155
management of laryngeal carcinoma located at the anterior commissure remains controversial .    2.498854968443579
local control rates with radiotherapy or surgery are not as good as those seen after treatment of UNK lesions .    2.4662352953176954
the vertical partial laryngectomy with epiglottic reconstruction ( vpler ) may be a more successful approach to such lesions .    2.2736387200479617
the charts of all patients treated for larynx carcinoma between 1991 and 1996 at the authors ' institutions were reviewed to identify those patients treated with vpler as described by UNK in 1965 , UNK in 1976 and UNK in 1979 .    2.5796548665719246
indications for performing surgery and outcome data of patients were collected and analyzed according to the indications for surgery , surgical technique , perioperative complications , oncological outcomes and functional results .    2.4506482412430484
twelve patients were identified that had been treated with vpler .    3.0600709685319725
indications for surgery included five patients with local recurrences following endoscopic laser partial laryngectomies , four cases with previously untreated primary tumors at the anterior commissure ( t2 n0 - 2 UNK ) , two with local recurrences following radiotherapy , and one with recurrence following frontolateral partial laryngectomy .    2.345442568157217
there were no postoperative complications except for one UNK fistula that required secondary repair .    2.1422174870063952
all patients were able to swallow at the tenth postoperative day .    2.421079302399054
all had their UNK closed after completion of wound healing , ( a mean of 17 days after surgery ) .    2.613219138587243
UNK results were usually poor .    2.6966827910351308
two local recurrences occurred during the follow - up period .    2.746026303790186
however , both patients were salvaged with total laryngectomies and have since been free from disease .    2.1901262400054717
our findings show that vpler is an effective surgical approach for carcinoma at the anterior commissure of the larynx that cannot be adequately managed with UNK laser surgery or simple frontolateral partial laryngectomy .    2.1000531540569045
this study demonstrates that the procedure can be successfully applied to the treatment of local recurrences following initial UNK or surgery .    3.0097471591645975
traditionally , intra - UNK diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia ( fmd ) of brain supplying arteries is a domain of conventional selective angiography .    2.1354751597135198
we are aware of only two publications reporting of ultrasound displayed intimal and medial variants of carotid artery fmd , in one case each .    2.016656691385165
we present a patient in whom color - coded duplex - sonography revealed a web - like carotid artery bulb stenosis meeting the specific criteria of a subtype of intimal fmd .    1.9051405782118451
the relationship between depression and the outcome of low back surgery was investigated .    2.9707679418561344
data analysis was based on two assumptions : ( 1 ) presurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery , and , therefore , depression can be interpreted as a risk factor for surgical failure .    2.7645303745854073
( 2 ) postsurgical assessments of depression are correlated with the outcome of surgery , and therefore , depression can be interpreted as a response to treatment failure .    2.672480256898037
the sample was made up of 78 patients who had undergone lumbar nucleotomy and 132 patients with lumbar spondylodesis .    2.316021308078388
treatment outcome was evaluated 6 months after surgery in the nucleotomy group and 9 months after surgery in the spondylodesis group .    2.7486279226696793
depression was assessed with the UNK depression inventory ( UNK ) .    2.92015771910651
in spondylodesis patients , however , there was a significant negative correlation with the patients ' subjective outcome ratings .    3.394487987533883
postsurgical depression scores , on the other hand , were significantly related to almost all of the outcome variables in both treatment groups .    2.711100115547864
patients with clinically relevant postsurgical depression scores were significantly more likely not to benefit sufficiently from surgery than those with clinically not relevant depression scores .    2.1126257886036823
our findings favour assumption 2 over assumption .    2.300615143782524
in the light of our findings , depressiveness is interpreted as a response to a non - beneficial outcome of surgery .    2.4979217582725455
the need for an interdisciplinary approach combining psychological counseling or treatment and physical therapy for those patients who do not benefit from surgery is discussed .    2.4950856264866363
using electron - beam computed tomography ( ebct ) with short exposure times of 100 or 50 ms and the capability of acquiring up to 2 x 17 images / s it is possible to study most of the important morphological and functional determinants of the heart .    2.296203864269878
various examples of studies in acute and chronic cardiac diseases are shown to demonstrate the use of ebct to determine quantitatively left ventricular volumes ( ml ) , myocardial mass ( g ) , wall thickness changes over the cardiac cycle ( mm / s ) , myocardial perfusion ( ml / 100 g / min ) and the extent of coronary calcification ( calcium score ) and qualitatively the state of the proximal 4 - 6 cm of the UNK coronary arteries .    2.6775790987561385
the knowledge of these determinants seems very useful in excluding cardiac dysfunction , in the early recognition of cardiac disease and in the evaluation of the haemodynamic severity of coronary artery stenotic lesions .    3.1547844923613533
further interdisciplinary studies are necessary to assess the clinical validity of these cardiac determinants , especially myocardial perfusion , using this advanced ct technology .    2.3314812555686717
fractures and dislocations of the elbow are some of the most common injuries in childhood and adolescence .    3.150267599591286
the injuries can be divided into pure dislocations of the joint and fractures of the distal humerus , proximal radius and ulna , or combinations of both .    2.600412078347809
in addition , extra - and intraarticular fracture types are defined , with the latter as partial or complete joint lesions .    2.3896899326080407
dislocations of the elbow joint or the radial head can occur as single injuries or in combination with a fracture .    2.6817151473271865
supracondylar fractures and avulsion fractures of the medial UNK are the most frequent extraarticular lesions of the distal humerus .    3.850613041718322
fractures of the lateral condyle prevail is incomplete intraarticular lesions .    2.4672849817848235
in the forearm , radial head and neck fractures are predominant while typical and atypical UNK injuries have a special status .    2.3879112633240287
the complex joint construction and the age - dependent appearance of the epiphyseal ossification centers sometimes make a correct radiological diagnosis difficult .    2.327019453470227
the trauma history and an exact , clinical examination help to verify the injury , as do comparative x - ray studies of the uninjured side when necessary ( but not routinely ) .    2.210793428810808
unlike other anatomical areas , most elbow injuries - even in the growing skeleton - are treated operatively .    2.239002168867116
hereby , the growth plates have to be respected using minimal amounts of small implants .    2.6258638324980694
additional immobilization in a cast for 2 - 4 weeks is necessary in most cases but does not lead to a functional deficit - in contrast to adults .    2.989743547094483
the implants should be removed as early as possible .    2.374305768967692
despite all therapeutic efforts , a significant number of late sequelae , such as UNK and functional impairment , can be seen .    2.863068899634433
the rate of long - term complications increases in cases of untreated displacement of fragments or joint instability .    2.8378582436216293
corrective measures are performed only in selected cases and after the growth plates are closed .    2.7271429301780077
our own treatment regime is demonstrated using exemplary clinical cases of the different injuries and the results of a long - term follow - up study on sports injuries of the elbow in children .    2.983796514223233
errors in diagnosis and therapy , as well as possible complications , are pointed out .    3.0381220322369784
2 - adrenergic agonists , mimicking the action of the inhibitory transmitter norepinephrine , cause antinociception due to postsynaptic inhibition of UNK projection neurons , presynaptic inhibition at the central nervous system termination of primary sensory nerves , presynaptic inhibition of brainstem UNK neurons and a generalized decrease in central nervous system sympathetic efferent activity .    1.9554694875304863
there is a mutual UNK of antinociceptive effects of clonidine and morphine .    2.381444626852201
clonidine is used in chronic pain states for treatment of neuropathic , UNK and UNK pain .    3.7955990297828675
based on a meta - analysis of the studies published in the years 1996 - 1996 , the therapeutic efficacy of systematically administered clonidine was evaluated in chronic pain states .    2.841529876824889
out of 403 screened published studies , only 9 fulfilled the selection criteria .    2.167989274549393
besides three case reports with successful clonidine treatment , four placebo - controlled studies could be analyzed treating the following chronic pain states : chest pain despite normal coronary angiograms ; painful diabetic neuropathy ; UNK UNK ; UNK in patients with sympathetically maintained pain and chronic low back pain .    2.275468898904121
although three studies demonstrated statistically significant improvement in pain scores , the improvement in pain relief in these cases was slight .    2.7931657626411157
long - term treatment was successful in a few responders over a period of 17 months .    3.0105803021340143
hyperalgesia caused by sympathetically maintained pain was relieved by topical ( transdermal ) application of clonidine .    2.108208895139796
based on this evaluation a grade c recommendation is derived , which relates to responders .    2.0175884671786024
successful treatment is expected only in pain states with increased sympathetic nervous system activity .    2.2918086688508366
therefore , in chronic pain , treatment with systemic clonidine is of no significant value .    2.4940093064664843
study objective : to investigate whether automatic tube compensation ( atc ) or conventional pressure support ( ps ) is UNK - able to compensate for the work of breathing imposed by the breathing circuit without altering the breathing pattern .    2.155406111757252
dna - based prenatal testing of the fetal genotype was performed in a family at risk for recurrence of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa ( rdeb ) .    2.433247505318555
dna from cultured fibroblasts and leukocytes from the peripheral blood of the previously affected offspring , dna from parental leukocytes and dna from fetal tissue obtained by chorionic villus biopsy was analysed by direct pcr amplification of known polymorphic regions within or flanking the type vii collagen gene , the UNK gene in rdeb .    1.8850253446876308
one flanking marker ( UNK / mspi ) as well as two UNK polymorphisms ( c7 / mspi , c7 / UNK ) in exons 30 and 84 were informative in this family .    2.3263874928573918
thus , based on the UNK analysis and the lack of evidence for locus heterogeneity in rdeb , a phenotypically healthy child was predicted .    2.5495196205944666
this prediction was confirmed by the birth of a healthy female infant .    2.52540485591066
the study reports successful determination of the fetal genotype by pcr - based prenatal diagnosis in a family at risk for recurrence of severe rdeb .    2.495494342016321
endothelins are peptides with powerful vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties .    2.206418463424528
it has become evident that endothelins are involved in many regulatory mechanisms of the circulation role both in short and in long term .    2.2781076691107227
however , in many cases it remains unclear whether the alteration of the endothelin metabolism is a primary pathology or a secondary phenomenon .    2.432305264985474
the synthesis of endothelin receptor antagonists and animal models with altered endothelin metabolism have opened a new era of endothelin research that will allow insight into the mechanisms of endothelin - action and eventually might lead to new therapeutic concepts .    1.9669015270037944
this review discusses the evidence both in favor and against pathogenic effects of endothelins in cardiovascular disease .    1.9908735102267812
the combination of fast mr sequences and rapid i . v . injection of paramagnetic contrast media provides information on cerebral perfusion .    2.0978785095746173
mr - perfusion imaging primarily UNK the relative cerebral blood volume .    2.459499612949975
the aim of this study was to test whether mr - perfusion imaging with a clinical mr scanner using a standard 2d - flash sequence provides clinically relevant information on patients with cerebrovascular diseases and brain tumors .    2.0227201660129466
brain infarctions , lesions in cerebral microangiopathy and occlusions of the carotid artery with very poor collateralization showed definite differences in perfusion imaging compared with normal controls .    2.017114389772318
however , our results show that acceleration of the imaging sequence and optimization of the contrast bolus and data processing are prerequisites for the clinical use of this method , which in principle may provide information on the absolute cerebral blood volume and even blood flow .    2.6751521465552766
lumbar microdiscectomy requires special instruments and provides a good view with a narrow approach .    2.201802492667551
the microscope is the best surgical aid .    2.7519579701319814
a specific complication of lumbar microdiscectomy - the wrong level - can be minimized by an exact preoperative planning .    2.2845243233273558
other complications like dural lesions and UNK bleeding are less frequent with the microscope because of the better view .    2.5579536501343925
the most severe complications that can occur with any lumbar disc operation , major vessel or visceral injury , can be avoided by UNK the new UNK with a depth UNK .    2.4411964331608353
from january 1987 to march 1994 three hospitals in the city of magdeburg treated a total of 103 subcutaneous achilles tendon ruptures operatively .    2.2798348967905646
we created a special score to compare the outcome of the different operation techniques used .    3.126861720722241
important aspects of the follow - up examination were isokinetic measuring of power and staying power by means of a UNK - UNK dynamic measuring device and the clinical check - up in comparison with the histological results and the patients ' history .    3.1358889193897594
degeneration could only be proved histologically in 38 , 8 % of the cases .    2.9205034361809648
the average score of all op methods applied was UNK of possible 1000 points .    2.2996620946292117
the adaptation suture ( UNK points ) , UNK ' s technique ( UNK points ) and the fibrin adhesive technique ( UNK points ) showed approximately the same results .    2.7770966608531253
the theory that all of the ruptures have a histological degeneration background seems to be wrong .    2.7008032142830465
isokinetic measuring can be very helpful in preparing a postoperative regimen to find the optimum load .    2.2574266305985797
to determine wether a somatic dysfunction of head joints depends from segmental muscle strain , we investigated 89 patients before , during and after general anesthesia .    2.170838037832345
we examined the disturbed joint motion as exclusive criterion for a somatic dysfunction , because through an anesthesia with endotracheal intubation including complete neuromuscular blockade segmental influences on the inspected joint were UNK .    1.9427908433865104
for complete muscle relaxation as required for UNK intubation a non UNK muscle relaxant was used .    2.27086293255713
somatic dysfunctions were found most frequent for side - inclination and UNK in segment o / c1 .    2.287380913326096
both before as well as during complete neuromuscular blockade could be found in the majority of examinations ( 89 , 1 % ) similar UNK of joint motions .    3.044448597600966
different theoretical models are presented for the interpretation of our results .    2.9173699179639283
we assume , that the disturbance of one component of the UNK organized segment is the basic UNK of somatic dysfunction .    2.908482448648834
this disturbance break through the spinal segmental inhibition and expand into the segment .    2.134432673001946
subsequently we discuss to replace the term " somatic dysfunction " through " segmental dysfunction " and to define it as increasing of UNK afference in the segment over a determined period of time with breakthrough of the spinal segmental inhibition threshold .    2.0002432006983457
postoperative intestinal atonia is a complication which is likely to occur in patients predisposed for constipation and in patients after intra - abdominal operations .    2.5016830362354403
the postoperative delay of bowel movement , however , is often also related to the type of anaesthesia being used .    2.9234805854128427
in order to evaluate the magnitude of an anaesthetic - induced postoperative delay of bowel movement , two types of intravenous - based anaesthesia using fentanyl / midazolam ( 1 mg / 25 mg ; dosage 0 . 1 ml / kg / h ) , and ketamine / midazolam ( 250 mg / 25 mg ; dosage 0 . 1 ml / kg / h ) respectively were compared with a volatile anaesthetic technique ( enflurane ; mean concentration 1 . 5 vol % ) .    2.3143889272413465
in three groups of patients ( each n = 15 ) undergoing elective surgery of the lower extremities , induction of anaesthesia was accomplished with methohexital ( 1 - 1 . 5 mg ) followed by succinylcholine ( 1 . 5 mg / kg ) to facilitate intubation .    2.9847071158910725
for the maintenance of muscle relaxation vecuronium UNK was used .    2.5980275619461266
no anticholinergic agents were used at the end of operation since they are known to interfere with bowel motility .    2.5332500066230152
in order to determine gastro - intestinal motility , the h2 exhalation test was used .    2.2019328412374914
for this purpose 40 g lactulose in 100 ml of water was given to all patients via a UNK tube shortly before extubation .    2.0324826548812642
lactulose is broken down by bacteria once it UNK the colon , and h2 is released , taken up by the vascular system and exhaled .    2.112028798797846
postoperatively , patients were asked to UNK into a 20 - ml syringe every 10 min .    2.572526664563331
the content was analysed for hydrogen ( ppm ) , using an electrochemical sensor ( UNK exhaled hydrogen monitor ) .    2.006196144525506
from the time of lactulose instillation to a threefold increase in endexpiratory hydrogen concentration ( compared to the preoperative value ) , gastro - coecal transit time was computed .    2.2871906438521945
also , the duration of operation was comparable in all three groups .    3.175047043991428
mean gastro - coecal transit time was 204 ( + / - 19 . 6 sd ) min following enflurane , 302 ( + / - 32 . 8 sd ) min following fentanyl / - midazolam and 210 ( + / - 28 . 8 sd ) min following ketamine / midazolam anaesthesia .    2.2274463908964752
the gastro - intestinal inhibition after the opioid - based anaesthetic technique was significantly prolonged ( p < 0 . 001 , kruskal - wallis test ) .    2.0592814659896033
there was no significance between patients after ketamine - based anaesthesia and those who had the volatile anaesthetic .    2.2217195535299545
when using intravenous anaesthesia with an opioid , gastro - intestinal inhibition , especially in patients prone to have constipation , is likely to develop postoperatively .    2.390021967529659
in classical UNK and in UNK in the icu , the simultaneous use of the UNK droperidol seems to counteract the inhibition of opioid - related gastrointestinal motility .    3.253534820858241
in cases of opioid - related gastrointestinal atonia a UNK compound may be necessary to overcome this effect on intestinal motility .    2.2301898680294117
in a prospective study 20 patients were monitored with serial sonograms and radiographs during distraction osteogenesis at the lower limb .    2.129782782037768
the distraction gap was seen as a UNK area in all patients after corticotomy .    3.0808589426108877
at an average of 20 . 7 ( 14 - 28 ) days after the beginning of the distraction , UNK foci occurred and showed increasing longitudinal alignment with further distraction .    2.3837369955143517
radiographical signs of beginning mineralization were seen an average of 48 . 3 days after the start of the distraction .    2.8137386649558955
exact measurement of the distraction gap was possible in all patients during lengthening .    3.242587791095614
bone healing complications and hematoma could be detected by ultrasound .    2.748510768689957
a rapid increase of bone mineralization was seen after the distraction was stopped .    2.412508101616652
with increasing UNK of the UNK bone , sonograms showed a hyper - reflecting solid line so that further mineralization and the time of removal of the fixator could not be assessed by ultrasound .    2.8624374781089195
ultrasound is more sensitive than radiography in identifying new bone formation during distraction , measuring the length of the distraction gap , and detecting early bone - healing complications and can therefore reduce the need for radiographs .    2.319220885754288
the interval between the onset of symptoms in patients with head and neck cancers and the introduction of treatment was evaluated .    3.2433078047405512
during a 1 - year period , patients were interviewed to determine the duration of any delays from the onset of complaints until the first visit to a doctor .    2.985768190603417
also asked was how long it took to be referred to an ent specialist and actual referral to our department .    2.0362195716285125
we then determined the interval from diagnosis to the introduction of therapy .    2.716698867000427
it was found that the delay of patients who went directly to an otorhinolaryngologist was shorter ( median , 8 weeks ) than that of patients who first went to their family doctors ( median , 13 weeks ) ( p < 0 . 02 ) .    2.357084723549859
the latter then took an additional 4 weeks before sending patients to an otorhinolaryngologist .    2.178857003942802
referral from the ent specialist to our department took another 2 weeks , as well as our staging and pre - therapeutic management .    2.60557240438495
our findings show that the patient himself is the critical factor in delaying diagnosis and therapy .    2.62616008882561
consultations of physicians without experience in otorhinolaryngology caused yet further delays .    2.1756623387259384
the present study deals with long - term dimensional changes in cemented UNK - type total hip endoprostheses .    2.6501041986239002
UNK and wear contribute to different UNK to the dimensional changes in polyethylene .    2.5462970226918697
the total amount of polyethylene wear is represented by the displacement of the femoral head into the UNK .    2.670402601014432
this rate diminishes after 5 years to an average of about 0 . 1 mm ( ceramics ) and 0 . 2 mm ( metal ) per year .    2.807239291784043
values exceeding 0 . 2 mm per year for the shift of the femoral head are considered to be unfavourable with regard to a probable loosening of the prosthesis .    2.7047451880920352
in this study we determined the orientation of the centre of the prosthetic head in relation to the wire marker of the polyethylene cup , comprising in all UNK total hip prostheses .    2.249805126432111
after an average of 77 months , 96 % of the prostheses with ceramic heads ( n = 109 ) had a wear rate of less than 0 . 2 mm per year .    2.925245274193298
using metal heads ( protasul - 2 and protasul - 10 ) this rate could only be measured in 71 % ( n = 109 ) of the prostheses ( 61 . 5 months ) .    2.7420592392645173
the combination ceramics - polyethylene produces half of the total amount of wear produced by metal - polyethylene .    2.3098035337483154
younger patients should preferably be treated with a ceramic UNK .    2.843128260995036
the so - called amyopathic dermatomyositis is a rare variant of dermatomyositis which has attracted increasing interest during the last years .    2.5610449908434623
one UNK the classical signs of dermatomyositis such as periorbital edema and erythema , erythematous macular and papular lesions localized at bony UNK ( so - called gottron ' s papules ) , generalized pruritus , UNK , and a cutaneous histopathologic picture compatible with skin lesions of dermatomyositis .    2.1531503609904417
crucial for the diagnosis is the exclusion of myositis by clinical examination , emg and histology .    3.095086722726929
furthermore , longterm supervision of patients is advisable in order not to miss the appearance of early signs of myositis .    2.290642953694644
the longest reported follow - up of amyopathic dermatomyositis patient is 4 years ; however , it cannot be excluded that these cases will eventually UNK in classical dermatomyositis .    2.4428541501018306
in this paper we describe two cases and discuss the differential diagnosis and therapy ; also , the term " UNK dermatomyositis " is proposed , to indicate that the full picture is to be expected in most cases .    2.624653838724283
the primary renal angiosarcoma is a rarely seen highly malignant tumor .    2.354093912593578
making a diagnosis based on histology may prove difficult .    2.560449018771411
because of hematogenous formation of metastases and bad prognosis in most cases we recommend that the surgical intervention be followed by the well tolerated systemic chemotherapy with UNK and UNK .    2.7076558202384726
this study compares the results of the outpatient - based program of the cochlear implant center ruhr with inpatient - based rehabilitation , which is almost exclusively performed in germany .    2.31369057675847
the department of otorhinolaryngology at the university of essen in germany provided 52 patients with either 22 - or 24 - channel nucleus cochlear implants from march 1996 to july 1999 .    2.1826985359367432
almost all patients ( n = 49 ) were UNK on an outpatient basis , which is the standard in many cochlear implant centers outside germany .    2.954292764302857
syringe drivers are used in anaesthetics , intensive care and emergency medicine to deliver small volumes of highly potent drugs with continuous , constant and reproducible flow .    2.1655588265833856
for early recognition of UNK of the drug delivery caused by occlusion of the infusion system , an alarm is triggered as soon as the system pressure exceeds a certain limit .    2.6286055219786335
the sensitivity of this alarm depends on the flow rate , type - specific cut - off pressure and the elastic parameters of the infusion system .    2.6660880396197086
the sudden release of pressure built up in the system after occlusion occurred can cause delivery of an uncontrolled drug bolus and hence an additional hazard .    2.0242968455491455
first , the alarm pressures at flow rates of 10 , 50 and 100 ml / h were measured .    2.130345047898829
then the alarm delay time and bolus volumes post - occlusion were assessed , using a basic infusion system ( syringe + single infusion set ) .    2.0450900989140863
finally , several alterations to the system like extension , tap battery with germ filters or branching were made and their impact on alarm delay and bolus volume measured .    1.8832187981564688
results : because of the great differences in alarm pressures between the devices tested , there were marked differences in the alarm delay at same flow rates .    2.567031640838687
predictably , there was an indirect proportional link between alarm delay and flow rate .    2.6730126616458425
using the basic infusion system , alarm delays between 23 s and 143 min were measured .    2.09472582645519
in two of the tested syringe drivers , a pressure - release mechanism is activated with the pressure alarm , which prevented bolus application .    2.1528110749489637
in the other devices , release of the pressure in the occluded system caused UNK of 0 . 5 - 7 ml .    2.938414533354586
variations in the actual syringe volume and insertion of a second connection tube had no impact on alarm delay and bolus volume .    2.204558365954216
tap batteries , parallel running syringe drivers or trapped air in the system , however , caused marked increase in both alarm delay ( 107 % ) and bolus volume ( + 147 % ) .    2.2929534414114143
discussion : unidentified occlusions of the system cause grave UNK of syringe drivers .    2.3781560741480674
while applying highly potent drugs , the discontinuation of drug delivery with subsequent bolus application can cause vital danger to the patient .    2.0464700441968664
as a result of the significant time delays in the pressure UNK , the devices tested do not provide sufficient protection against unrecognized system occlusion .    2.3611899708356368
syringe drivers with adjustable alarm pressure can be set close to the actual infusion pressure .    2.3527657724830773
a further important point is that one should aim at a reduction in the elastic properties of the infusion set because of the great impact on alarm delay and bolus volume .    2.5271487762038842
because the overall results of conservative treatment for distal radial fractures have been unsatisfactory , it is rarely used .    2.7083857929693593
however , minimally invasive methods such as stabilization by external fixation and percutaneous k - wire pinning are being increasingly used .    2.2749157132729745
a justified indication for the use of k - wire pinning is that it provides an opportunity to achieve good and very good short - and long - term anatomic and functional results .    2.6733096762319297
reports on plaster - free functional treatment after k - wire pinning have been published .    2.2585236797840333
the indications therefore need to be further specified .    2.836455162792498
follow - up studies and an analysis of our patients show a strong increase in k - wire stabilization and good - to - very good results in 75 % of the cases .    2.9708302803832076
UNK of the UNK tract by lymphoproliferative disorders is rare .    3.109510097571242
rapid proliferating burkitt ' s lymphomas could mimic acute diseases .    2.187682490063796
initial surgery should be restricted to acute abdominal complications or complete removal of localised resectable disease .    2.398187439100648
in any case a UNK chemotherapy is necessary .    2.7221880701940417
wet autoclaving is a simple , reliable and time - effective method for antigen retrieval in routinely processed UNK material .    2.2201985044744506
both routine diagnostic ( e . g . , oestrogen and progesterone receptors , cytoskeletal proteins ) and research antibodies ( e . g . various p53 antibodies , mdm - 2 , bcl - 2 , mib - 1 ) are reported to demonstrate its application .    2.314004202973865
wet autoclaving may allow successful application of antibodies in paraffin - embedded tissues designed for use on frozen sections .    2.0352534525452186
the technique has the UNK - UNK to reliably handle up to 200 sections at a time , without evidence of any significant damage to the sections or nuclear morphology .    2.670378242707553
classical stable plate osteosynthesis with its anatomical repositioning , absolute stability between fragments and medial support should only be applied to joint fractures and UNK bone .    2.181097639127699
in cortical bone , the anatomical reposition connected with the plate promotes bone necrosis along the fracture and prevents callus formation .    2.2082009982383997
direct cortical synthesis , a method also known as " primary bone healing " , serves the bone ' s revascularisation and is not necessarily aimed at healing .    2.1571292324701505
thus , this may also be termed " necrosis healing " .    2.5600593045933393
along the shaft of long bones , elastic plate osteosynthesis , a biological method , is safer than and superior to the rigid technique .    2.1744663991521778
this even applies to short oblique and transverse fractures insofar as nailing does not appear feasible .    1.9700608740426513
elasticity is achieved by leaving a flexible stretch of at least 2 - 4 holes , i . e .    2.5001196335139175
as long as possible , without screws over the fracture and by employing a titanium plate .    2.443876984015209
thus , there is no punctate fatigue leading to plate UNK .    2.5694635571199607
the fitting of third fragments is deliberately left out .    2.232766620268309
the same applies to all kinds of compression with lag screws , tension devices or UNK - gliding holes - and this with the intention of allowing UNK in the fracture ' s UNK .    2.3655435777481375
periost and muscle are not removed and the fracture is not examined .    2.424941325479773
healing occurs spontaneously via a fixating callus forming within the first 3 - 6 weeks out of the periost - soft tissue combination .    2.455012688143314
histomorphological investigation dates the first woven - bone bridges between the fragments to 3 weeks subsequent to the accident .    2.048702313105325
in göttingen university trauma centre , 87 fractures have been attended to over 2 years using this technique .    2.1353700940132443
despite considerable soft - tissue damage , no delayed bone healing , pseudoarthrosis or bone infection has been observed .    2.3547969894857617
the risks of elastic plate osteosynthesis lie in UNK and exaggerated reposition methods , too short a flexible stretch , and insufficient anchorage of the screws .    2.2068367015610466
diagnosis of a thrombosis in the peripheral veins can now be made with almost 100 % certainty using either phlebography or duplex sonography .    2.396880952138706
a correct diagnosis depends on the expertise of the examiner .    2.852320373708814
both methods are available throughout germany .    2.7396228879733364
although both are equally suitable for primary diagnostic investigations , duplex sonography has assumed an important role due to the fact that it is not invasive .    2.7832777325964027
phlebography is vital if there are specific issues that need to be clarified .    2.443233742502774
this applies if invasive treatment methods are being considered , if an expert opinion is required or if scientific issues need to be determined .    2.2118776454460427
discrepancy between clinical findings and the results of duplex sonography also constitutes an important indication for phlebography .    2.7139353758673743
in many institutions , both methods are used in a " golden partnership " in cases in which it is important to obtain comprehensive records .    2.6250396615205536
for frequent ventricular ectopic beats , currently , reassurance and pharmacological therapy are the UNK of treatment .    2.6426298079004504
this study assesses the useful role of catheter ablation in eliminating frequent monomorphic ventricular ectopic beats in severely symptomatic patients .    2.130668832922149
catheter ablation was performed in 65 patients with frequent drug refractory ventricular ectopic beats .    2.7090069381928514
the site of origin of ventricular ectopic activity was accurately mapped by using pace mapping , earliest endocardial activation time , and UNK mapping .    2.459877094076832
in 5 patients a new non - contact mapping was additionally performed .    2.202129569574354
the ectopic focus was located in the right ventricular outflow tract in 37 and in the left ventricle in 28 patients .    3.0489606961833378
ventricular ectopic beats were successfully eliminated by catheter ablation in 49 / 65 patients ( 75 % ) .    2.2282485490449058
during a mean follow up of 13 + / - 11 months , 9 of 49 successful ablated patients ( 18 % ) had a recurrence .    2.7599017995657165
radiofrequency catheter ablation can be successfully used to eliminate ventricular ectopic activity .    2.4600152021945627
it may , therefore , be a reasonable alternative for the treatment of severely symptomatic , drug resistant monomorphic ventricular ectopic activity .    2.6899935608161853
injuries of the forefoot are a challenge for orthopaedic surgeons .    2.7313632955918625
after healing of bone and soft tissue damage , posttraumatic UNK can persist .    2.912951097500211
the paper presents a therapy algorithm with newly designed UNK , which consist of the common orthopaedic UNK like a UNK bottom and a stiffening of the sole .    2.117857212195078
the therapy is shown on two cases .    2.6628934690449104
with these UNK adequate is possible and pain relief realistic .    2.560487361109556
background : myopic prk up to 6 d is an approved and safe procedure .    2.24978045575702
nitric oxide ( no ) can play an important role in the regulation of vascular tone and neurotransmission , as well as in non - specific immunoreactions and inflammation in a variety of tissues .    2.8007867989707873
increased quantities of nitric oxide in UNK air can be measured during inflammatory processes .    2.441380474682365
both normal 12 lead electrocardiogram and treadmill stress tests showed no significant st changes .    2.1644017970954774
a thallium - 201 scintigraphy afterwards disclosed a non - transmural septal ischemia .    2.3735123241077822
the consecutively performed diagnostic catheterization revealed a severe , almost pouch - like proximal aneurysm of the right coronary artery with a maximal diameter of 15 - 20 mm as well as an aneurysmatic modified left coronary artery and an impaired left ventricular function ( ef 49 % ) .    2.4378731415785784
in the absence of coronary artery stenosis , the patient was treated conservatively with an ace inhibitor ( UNK 20 mg / day ) under accompanying effective anticoagulant therapy with UNK .    2.818436545721244
with this strategy the patient has been UNK during the eight month follow - up period .    2.7428847815570787
we investigated in 17 children ( mean 7 . 1 years ) the continuous administration of tramadol following augmentation UNK or UNK reconstruction .    2.675197867494429
mean duration of the tramadol administration on the pediatric ward was 3 . 8 + / - 1 . 1 days ( initial dosage 0 . 25 mg / kg / per hour , dose adjustment by the nursing staff ) .    2.778398171715007
mean tramadol consumption was 0 . 21 mg / kg / h on day 1 and was reduced to 0 . 08 mg / kg / per hour on day 4 .    2.6986169637217965
median pain score ( assessed with ten - step scales ) was 5 before treatment and between 2 . 5 ( day 1 ) and 0 . 5 ( day 5 ) during therapy .    2.5257467012939103
lowest oxygen UNK ( mean ) ranged from 93 . 8 % to 95 . 2 % .    2.663169375746522
three patients ( 17 . 6 % ) suffered from nausea / vomiting on 3 of 64 treatment days ( 4 . 7 % ) .    2.644025636219131
pruritus and extreme sedation did not occur .    2.4360256687257973
the continuous administration of tramadol is a simple and safe procedure following major urological surgery in children .    2.456965342874963
over the past 5 - 7 years , there has been a renewed research interest into the mechanism as well as the development of newer " emerging " treatment modalities for atrial fibrillation .    2.8682192476433164
one of these novel therapies is the implantable atrial defibrillator .    2.3871708377093777
in this article we will review the basic and clinical research which has been used in the development of electrode systems and shock waveforms utilized by commercially - available implantable atrial cardioversion devices .    2.3596721331466144
in 26 patients with abscesses in the maxillofacial area , the electrolyte concentrations , ph and osmotic and hydrostatic pressures of the pus fluid were measured and calculated .    1.957483429252192
the main UNK identified were sodium ( 134 + / - 38 mmol / l ) and potassium ( 37 + / - 16 mmol / l ) and as UNK chloride ( 183 + / - 46 mmol / l ) and bicarbonate ( 10 + / - 4 mmol / l ) .    2.6692685787063994
the ph value of the pus liquid was 6 . 164 + / - 0 . UNK .    2.938451815696164
the calculated mean osmotic pressure of the pus liquid was UNK + / - UNK mm hg , whereas the measured physical pressure inside the abscess was 49 + / - 13 mm hg .    2.5530078456810323
both pressure types show time - dependent pressure curves .    2.5343756052085054
with time , the real pressure inside the abscess cavity increases , whereas the osmotic pressure decreases .    2.533651878027864
there was no relationship between the two pressure types and the different species of microorganisms responsible for the inflammation .    2.6892362842989646
the results of the study reveal that abscesses can be regarded as UNK active systems , and the mechanism by which the abscess is formed might be as follows .    2.600741368509456
after penetration of UNK microorganisms into the tissue space , the area of acute inflammation is walled off by the collection of inflammatory cells .    2.2209776188641963
destruction of tissue by products of the UNK UNK takes place and results in UNK necrosis and a hypertonic abscess cavity .    2.7358152851552533
the UNK - directed flow of tissue fluids into the cavity via the abscess membrane causes volume expansion and generates pressure , two facts that can explain the swelling dynamics and typical symptoms of abscesses in the maxillofacial area .    1.8819088309791767
internal mammary artery ( ima ) bypass grafts have a satisfactorily long lasting blood supply to the myocardium .    2.119446130481086
their initial flow capacity can be insufficient with subsequent regional myocardial ischemia .    2.228748048308795
this study represents a feasable surgical method to evaluate the effectiveness of the ima graft function by temperature measurement of the heart during warm reperfusion after hypothermic cardioplegia .    2.6178413472362165
twenty - five patients with multi - vessel coronary artery disease underwent coronary artery bypass grafting using the ima as an arterial graft to the left anterior descending coronary artery and saphenous vein grafts to the remaining coronary arteries .    2.259974501020132
distal anastomoses were installed during cold intermittent blood - UNK arrest .    2.2888892473710505
after UNK the aorta and ima graft , the temperatures in cardiac front and rear sides were measured during the first five minutes of warm reperfusion .    2.1018668625925185
a sufficient ima graft function was expressed by a typical rise of temperature : the cardiac front and rear sides showed a parabolic and exponential course , respectively .    1.9122401254969068
the rewarming speed expressed as the first derivative of temperature over time led to a sharp and early peak for the front side , and a smaller and delayed peak for the rear side .    2.3347019689776722
an insufficient ima graft function could be recognized by atypical temperature courses .    2.267479921337018
UNK ' s disease ( UNK UNK UNK ) is a rare x - chromosome linked recessive disorder belonging to the group of UNK .    3.850876873036689
the basic defect involves the gene encoding alpha - galactosidase .    2.3298776127245513
because this enzyme is responsible for decomposition of UNK , its deficiency results in their accumulation in endothelial and smooth muscle cells .    2.4409804532893475
with time , generalized UNK , paresthesias , renal and cardiac insufficiency and cerebrovascular complications develop .    2.1203199562773425
we report a patient who in addition to the well - described findings also showed unique nail fold capillary changes not described so far .    2.262050732541259
analysis of serum concentration of alpha - galactosidase identified three female heterozygous carriers in the patient ' s family .    2.3400394482954985
benign , proliferative changes of the brunner ' s gland are very rare and account for about 10 % of duodenal bulb neoplasias .    2.615241860323351
the authors present a case of brunner ' s gland adenoma of unusual dimensions ( 12 x 5 x 2 . 5 cm ) .    2.4102272366553383
the patient presented with UNK epigastric discomfort as isolated symptoms .    2.5375415747491026
in this case we performed surgical treatment , including a UNK and polypectomy .    2.893739066908287
because they are localized in the UNK small , superficial endoscopic biopsies may fail to confirm the diagnosis .    2.5721195104763788
malignancy seems to occur only very rarely , with only 14 cases reported in the literature .    2.211796385178332
as the majority of brunner ' s adenomas are quite small , endoscopic polypectomy will confirm the diagnosis and cure the condition in most cases .    2.528551649292706
large symptomatic adenomas may require surgical resection .    2.434667572037906
objective : how does adjuvant training of strength and endurance influence the muscular , cardial , respiratory , immunological systems , and the quality of life during UNK chemotherapy in a UNK athlete with liver metastasis after resection of a carcinoma of the rectum .    2.461985052401069
patient and method : a 58 - year - old athlete with metastatic carcinoma of the rectum ( UNK , n0 , m - liver , g2 ) underwent regional chemotherapy ( UNK acid , 5 - fluorouracil ) via an intrahepatic port system .    2.427077546846317
six cycles with 5 days each were applied .    2.410551650066799
before and after chemotherapy , an echocardiogram , resting and exercise electrocardiogram , lung function , natural killer cells and the gastrointestinal quality of life index ( glqi ) was evaluated .    2.3593898150586314
after chemotherapy was finished , the effects of training were assumed .    2.7632073447030763
results : strength increased between 0 % and 144 % .    2.1670888742255356
endurance improvement was measured on the last comparable submaximal intensity step , expressed by reduction of heart rate and lactate concentration by 10 and 21 . 5 % , respectively , improvement of lung function regarding UNK 1 and UNK by 12 . 9 and 11 . 3 % , respectively , and UNK in 11 . 4 % .    2.8259865454212867
the relative count of natural killer cells increased by 27 . 2 % , and the glqi improved from 109 points ( pathologic ) to 129 points ( normal ) .    2.3635455480744794
conclusion : there were positive effects on muscular and cardial mechanisms of adaptation and on illness - related quality of life .    2.1217233006756766
postoperative sports activity during regional chemotherapy is possible .    2.4508232735698976
introduction : we report our experience with laparoscopic nephrectomy in comparison to open nephrectomy in geriatric patients .    2.830033989800234
the laparoscopic technique is presented and the results are discussed with respect to the data from the current literature .    3.62929280766697
material and methods : since 1993 , a total of 249 patient have undergone a nephrectomy for benign renal disease .    2.4087281510332885
in 131 patients a laparoscopic nephrectomy ( in most cases via a transperitoneal approach ) was performed and in 118 patients an open nephrectomy via a flank incision .    2.2788905889638866
clinical parameters were compared between both groups as well as with respect to different age groups .    3.194488581184511
patients in the laparoscopy group demonstrated significant advantages with respect to blood loss , transfusion rate , analgesic consumption , hospital stay , and convalescence .    2.5962406457749982
these advantages were not related to patient age .    2.639385267226465
the complication rate was comparable for both groups ; however , both groups showed an elevation of the complication rate in the age groups 75 to 84 years .    2.678873648666702
the mortality rate within the first 30 days after nephrectomy was 1 . 7 % in the open nephrectomy group .    3.1403506918199238
conclusions : the laparoscopic nephrectomy offers comparable operative results ( with less blood loss and a lower transfusion rate ) when compared to open nephrectomy .    2.262688147955571
in terms of postoperative parameters , patients in the laparoscopy group have significant advantages .    2.639564913320739
especially geriatric patients benefit from these advantages and , therefore , the laparoscopic approach should be the preferred technique for a nephrectomy in these patients .    2.63147806680977
the vast majority of adder bites among children in germany is caused by the common viper ( vipera berus ) .    2.40804306517497
the venom that is applicated by the viper contains several enzymes , some of them with hemorrhagic and neurotoxic activity .    2.138941096233425
adder bites among children may be without any symtoms but as well may cause severe intoxication .    2.1786528858564758
the aim of this study was to evaluate the results after open bankart repair using suture anchors in patients with recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability .    2.2423130723764815
some 32 patients were prospectively observed for a mean of 40 months ( 24 - 60 ) after stabilization .    2.5578760423394966
the mean age at the time of operation was 29 . 7 years .    2.6645417042415755
all patients were postoperatively immobilized in a sling for 3 weeks .    2.2735399846063786
according to the criteria of rowe , 29 patients ( 90 . 6 % ) had good or excellent results .    2.9867596267747416
two patients ( 6 . 3 % ) developed recurrent instability 6 - 24 months postoperatively ; 93 . 7 % were not or only UNK limited in sports activities .    2.6977528654374185
bankart repair is an excellent treatment for recurrent posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability .    2.400820235848602
the use of suture anchors is an appropriate way of UNK the capsuloligamentous complex to the glenoid to restore stability to an unstable joint .    2.172656555125789
purpose : assessment of coronary artery bypass graft ( cabg ) patency with computed tomography methods has been demonstrated as an alternative to coronary angiography .    2.5687636799851052
prospective ecg triggering of conventional ct scanners al - UNK heart phase - triggered single - slice acquisition in the sub - second range .    1.9486239280190782
the goal of this study was to evaluate whether the use of ecg triggering can optimize the evaluation of proximal cabg anastomoses .    2.6473307875822063
multiple personality is known since last century und has been described by UNK and freud as well as by UNK .    2.8810940658015536
in the latest and nearly exclusively angloamerican literature multiple personality disorder is included in the UNK reactions in borderline personality disorder .    2.430754403643492
the concept of comorbidity is criticized .    2.62698055077387
case studies illustrate indications for diagnosing UNK .    2.4480687918155293
the authors point out , that sufficient diagnostic methods and criteria are still not existing .    2.312370379980352
but their development has its limits : in most cases a history of sexual abuse can be detected and therefore an intensive diagnostic " investigation " can be on a psychodynamic level a UNK of traumatic abuse .    2.4269401514458315
many new methods have been introduced in reproductive medicine in recent years , and some have already found their way into clinical routine .    2.548825256212468
cryopreservation of oocytes and in vitro maturation and culture of primordial follicles do not play a significant role in patient treatment .    2.290221019306555
UNK culture has mostly replaced UNK techniques and , given appropriate laws , provides adequate possibility of selecting embryos with high developmental and implantation potential .    1.9241881593591765
an exact pronuclear diagnosis also has a high ability to predict the probability of implantation .    2.678154247697604
viewing the latest data , assisted UNK seems to bring no improvements for most patients .    2.262759445758516
preimplantation diagnosis is being discussed in germany due to new statements from ethical committees .    2.335356532992895
cytoplasma transfer , nuclear transfer , or the transplantation of UNK cells into donors are currently only experimental .    2.3664798726797924
the importance of spiral - ct is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors .    1.9232997912188778
its importance for follow - up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors .    2.2420030852694044
using spiral - ct multiple signs of alterations ( n = 98 ) can be diagnosed , which are not only important for tumour relapse , but also for assessment .    2.450034113968651
spiral - ct offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy .    2.3016748204033717
in follow - up examinations after radiation , laryngoscopy and spiral - ct are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath - holding technique ( separately reconstructed ) and also as functional spiral - ct of the vocal cords in " i " - phonation .    1.7606545264012963
in the years 1980 - 1992 surveys were undertaken to ascertain the occurrence of central nervous system infections in children in pediatric departments in the german UNK of bavaria and lower saxony .    2.4114835873937
there was a very noticeable drop in viral meningitides over the survey years especially in mumps meningitis , i . e . from 199 / 205 in 1980 to 16 / 7 in 1992 .    1.8753505278229625
in both states about 80 % of the viral meningitides could not be clarified etiologically .    3.1361711473303133
whereas in bavaria a steady increase in herpes simplex encephalitides and UNK zoster encephalitides was apparent ( 1 / 4 in 1980 , 10 / 24 in 1992 ) , the same development was not found in lower saxony .    2.1594940277272445
although the number of measles encephalitides dropped in both states during the period of the survey , up to 6 cases of the illness occurred annually .    2.7085564406115394
only in the case of herpes simplex encephalitis the rate of recovery shows a substantial improvement over the observation period , while for other forms the rate of partial recovery has remained approximately the same .    2.768218038969225
purpose : to assess patient reliability and compliance , most UNK check for false - positive and - negative answers .    2.1278347716430965
in this study the results of catch trials were obtained with video UNK with respect to age - related changes and differences for tests using increment and decrement stimuli .    2.4476596574165774
during a 7 - year period ( between july 1987 and june 1994 ) 19 patients were treated for chopart dislocation .    2.477684207901161
seventeen patients were examined clinically 48 months following trauma .    2.7376552224633555
we found 1 excellent , 6 good , 6 UNK , and 4 poor results .    2.6567976668147386
only 4 patients were able to achieve their pre - accident level of work and no patients could return to sports at the same level .    2.3424891058707273
in our patients , chopart dislocation had a negative social consequence both at the work place and in recreational activities .    1.980098052281058
in long - term follow - up , the chopart dislocation was the most UNK injury even for polytrauma patients .    2.718369037073424
for incidents of malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) outside the hospital , a high number of UNK cases must be reckoned with because of an insufficient knowledge of emergency services and poor identification and documentation that make it impossible to classify acute situations under the diagnosis of malignant hyperthermia crisis .    2.3004291056236434
as a result , there are no statistical data in this field , and only case reports with a broad spectrum of suspected trigger mechanisms have been published .    2.6517357809895
the case described in this report is a proved example of a non - anesthesia - related triggering of mh in a 21 - year - old man who had had an anesthetic - induced mh manifestation in childhood , which was confirmed with an in vitro contracture test .    2.3812370846829967
after UNK a UNK , he became unconscious and convulsive after consuming a high level of alcohol ( 2 . UNK ) .    2.58075591801967
the first cardiocirculatory arrest occurred directly before hospitalization .    2.296530740875933
after admission , the patient showed a full - UNK mh episode whose subsequent fatality was unavoidable in spite of adapted and optimal therapy .    2.4220938241647936
suspected trigger mechanisms seem to be UNK ( excessive alcohol consumption , over - heating , mental stress ) as a forensic investigation did not point to any particular signs of typical trigger substances .    2.1112527000359695
the case demonstrates again that an mh attack might be triggered under certain non - anaesthesia - related situations .    1.9886155779253054
for patients with an mh disposition , additional information on their behavior outside the hospital is required .    2.749332120304649
UNK UNK UNK of different species live worldwide as parasites in UNK mammals .    2.69908478102366
in the host the larval development causes typical UNK , i . e . , abscesses including the UNK .    2.3666861744101486
as a result of increasing UNK traffic , UNK can also bring back to germany tropical types of UNK .    2.16011507445001
surgical treatment of diffuse peritonitis is applied very UNK .    2.7956098290662728
there is no question that source control is the most important treatment principle , but the role of additional treatment concepts such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage remains controversial .    2.674832095182791
in a prospective survey ( 1993 - 1996 ) we analyzed the need for additional treatment concepts in our patient material .    2.6973975480898926
in 186 patients with diffuse peritonitis we applied the concept of source control and extensive ( 20 - 30 l ) intraoperative lavage .    2.260511949177535
additional treatment principles such as continuous postoperative peritoneal lavage ( n = 17 ) or staged lavage ( n = 5 ) were applied only " on demand " , namely in 20 patients ( 11 % ) .    2.577534723818592
in 166 patients ( 89 % ) source control of diffuse peritonitis was possible .    2.3082611140656017
the primary cause of peritonitis in our patients was perforation or leakage in the lower gi tract ( 52 % ) .    2.325626420912002
the hospital mortality rate was 12 % in the whole group , and the postoperative morbidity rate was 34 % .    3.239166373485608
we conclude that nowadays , using high - quality intensive care as well as modern antiinfective treatment , only a few patients ( ca .    2.745385987232208
10 % ) need additional therapy measures such as postoperative lavage .    2.570018038287907
surgical source control in combination with intraoperative lavage is sufficient in most of the patients with diffuse peritonitis .    3.2279573642234527
native tissue harmonic imaging is a new way of ultrasound image processing that addresses the difficult - to - image patient .    2.3229357100480903
by using a UNK shaped transmit pulse it is possible to separate from the returning echo the harmonic component without overlapping with fundamental reflections .    2.1762968189745022
the improved image quality leads to higher diagnostic confidence so that the use of further imaging modalitites is unnecessary .    2.4914748820781853
aim : the aim of this study was to validate the detection of calcified arteriosclerotic plaques with intravascular ultrasound ( ivus ) .    2.282116590057496
method : 181 arteries were examined by 20 / 30 mhz ivus .    2.32177215993185
the ultrasound cross - sections were compared to the corresponding radiologic ( 30 kv ) and histologic cross - sections .    2.4965511437733463
results : calcified lesions were imaged as bright UNK with UNK .    2.4035779400584167
in 13 cases of 161 calcified lesions were too small to detect by ivus .    2.2639857411621382
in 5 ultrasonic sections the diagnosis " calcified lesion " could not be verified neither by radiology nor by histology .    2.1850603029990596
the sensitivity was 91 . 6 % , the specificity was 94 . 7 % and the accuracy was 93 . 0 % .    3.2178432877209913
conclusions : because of the acoustic properties of calcium , calcified lesions can be detected accurately by ivus .    2.5146785143085464
ivus can generate new insights into the effect of plaque composition on the response to catheter therapies .    2.5946317801328376
the topic was " the past in the present " .    2.8829628987178837
the participants were UNK and UNK , the staff international .    3.645662243438351
the method used was the application of the " group relations conference " , specially devised for these conferences .    2.550320673354423
the leadership was in the hands of UNK j . miller , director of the group relations program at the UNK institute of human relations in UNK , where this group method originated and continues to be particularly cultivated still today .    2.2130912190891827
it is especially suited when an unconscious conflict between subgroups exists that emerges on the surface in forms which lead to confusion and misunderstandings .    1.9855816769936858
the task which had been put to the participants was as follows : to explore how feelings and UNK influence relations within and between the two groups .    2.14748117558723
there were moments when UNK and reality got confused , accompanied by intense feelings .    2.0605646094826255
in this paper my experience with a UNK for cases with bone diseases is reported .    2.638203836695223
all cases which had been diagnosed in the newly formed department of bone pathology of the university of hamburg since 1970 were registered in uniform fashion .    2.443208037314626
adapting the system to state - of - the - art network structures required a lot of personal and financial investment .    2.1985743377410394
this could not be accomplished by university resources alone , but only in cooperation with other research funds .    2.7103747015618174
now 76 000 cases can be routinely UNK and scientifically analysed .    2.243951010231792
background and purpose : in germany , 750 , 000 children are born per year who should be screened for developmental visual defects in the age range 24 - 48 months .    2.1861762946192327
however , the established pediatric screening program is not sufficient to prevent amblyopia .    2.4544632726346216
the purpose of this study was to examine the cost - effectiveness of alternatives for amblyopia and UNK screening .    2.191565378998748
the fluorescence diagnosis based on the UNK acid - stimulated UNK synthesis allows the detection of superficial tumors in a very early stage even when they are very small tumors .    2.634034979280025
a fluorescence diagnosis of tumors in the oral cavity can be simply performed by rinsing with a 0 . 4 % ala solution for 20 min .    2.6207839295019673
this topical application avoids systemic side effects such as skin sensitization .    2.514430184453788
the red fluorescent areas are visible to the naked eye ; only a blue light source for fluorescence excitation is necessary and a suitable red filter for observation .    1.976505193765457
in our study on 56 patients suffering from carcinoma of the oral cavity , 96 % of the histologically confirmed carcinoma could be visualized via fluorescence .    2.660881389424794
in 3 patients additional tumors were detected via fluorescence that were not visible otherwise .    2.2152883808199926
however , many patients show fluorescent areas with no correlation to the histological finding .    2.423383503493967
it was verified that bacteria from the oral cavity also produce UNK after ala incubation , which leads to false - positive findings .    2.197004641140964
reduction of the false - positive findings was achieved by rinsing the oral cavity with hydrogen peroxide and by mechanical plaque reduction .    2.5596585798415417
this improves the reliability of a fluorescence - guided biopsy .    2.4678977569009604
however , suppression of the bacteria fluorescence is necessary for clinical use of this diagnostic method .    2.8272511277010164
autocapture is a newly developed automatic threshold tracking algorithm implemented in implantable pacemakers .    2.1609837793874878
based on the detection of the cardiac evoked response , autocapture continuously controls the effectiveness of stimulation .    2.924013824697218
increases in threshold are immediately followed by an adaption of the pulse amplitude .    2.278518598670814
automatic threshold tests periodically lower the amplitude in order to adapt to decreased thresholds .    2.570601119939576
thus , changes in threshold can be monitored over a long period and utilized as a diagnostic tool .    2.40254357556336
this case report demonstrates the diagnosis and monitoring of a UNK by means of autocapture .    3.837425597917917
the indication to treat symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation is discussed UNK .    2.530123246374696
successful medical treatment may result in the reduction of symptoms by improving hemodynamics in a reduction of thromboembolic events .    2.9137156030915947
however , several antiarrhythmic drugs are also known to increase the risk of proarrhythmic events .    2.755398468537139
tissue engineering offers the possibility to UNK living substitutes for tissues and organs by combining histogenic cells and biocompatible carrier materials .    2.038502137813513
pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells are isolated and UNK ex vivo and then their histogenic differentiation is induced by external factors .    2.1087672202355896
the UNK of bone and cartilage constructs , their combinations and gene therapeutic approaches are demonstrated .    2.6120427990196387
advantages and disadvantages of these methods are described by in vitro and in vitro testing .    2.7490115264569894
the proof of UNK function after implantation in vivo is essential .    2.3986656873948355
the use of autologous cells and tissue engineering methods offers the possibility to overcome the disadvantages of classical tissue reconstruction - donor site morbidity of autologous grafts , UNK of allogenic grafts and loosening of alloplastic implants .    2.140876941260594
furthermore , tissue engineering UNK the spectrum of surgical indications in bone and cartilage reconstruction .    2.523879578028355
the purpose of this paper is to present principle and technique of proximal lateral column lengthening by calcaneal osteotomy and to critically analyze our preliminary results .    2.024750191776386
16 patients ( 7 female , 9 male ; average age 52 . 3 years [ 24 - 72 years ] ) were treated for stage ii to iii posterior tibial tendon insufficiency by calcaneal osteotomy and medial soft tissue reconstruction ( tendon reconstruction , 15 ; tendon transfer , 8 ; deltoid ligament repair , 10 ) .    1.9771639003756938
when the aofas ankle - hindfoot rating scale was applied , these patients were shown to have significantly increased their scores from an average preoperative value of 49 . 1 to a mean postoperative value of 91 . 1 after a mean follow - up of 24 . 6 months .    2.360535914522871
in all but one case no loss of achieved foot correction was noted .    2.199425778359391
in one case , a fusion of the calcaneocuboid joint had to be performed after 5 months due to painful degenerative joint disease .    2.7048466149383983
at follow - up , all patients had satisfactory restoration of their medial longitudinal arch , reduction of forefoot abduction , and restored arch height .    2.339497002658816
all patients were able to fully weight - bear the operated foot , and all patients were satisfied with the achieved result .    2.409415793764702
in the pes UNK deformity occurring in stage ii to iii ( as significant degenerative joint disease has not already occurred ) , osteotomies appear to have a significant role in the operative management and to function by restoring more normal biomechanics , thus allowing tendon reconstruction and tendon transfers to return to successfull function .    2.151292122148787
by the update of UNK a of the german road traffic act driving under the influence of drugs of abuse can now be UNK even in absence of an actual driving impairment .    2.296515732676183
the only UNK is the detection of certain drugs / metabolites in a blood sample .    2.9938235761607443
therefore for UNK there is a need for fast and reliable immunological screening methods in blood / serum .    2.4798858417605794
the new mahsan UNK enzyme immunoassay ( mtp - eia ) is claimed to be sensitive and independent of the matrix .    2.2193909721679526
for an evaluation we carried out a comparison of the cannabinoid and opiate assays from mahsan ( mtp - eia ) and the routinely used abbott fluorescence polarization immunoassay ( fpia ) with a UNK of routine serum samples .    2.3973558272957405
for the mtp - eias we used the cut - off recommendations of the UNK ( cannabinoids 2 ng / ml , opiates 10 ng / ml ) .    2.6099881991881864
for the abbott UNK the serum samples had to be pretreated ( UNK with acetone ) and appropriate cut - UNK were defined by our investigations ( cannabinoids 20 ng / ml , opiates 30 ng / ml ) .    2.1844893585304574
out of 136 samples screened for cannabinoids 42 % were positive with gc - ms and 18 % from 123 samples were positive for opiates .    2.0178074159021118
the abbott cannabinoid fpia gave false negative results in 23 % of gc - ms positive cases and 9 % false negatives for opiates while mahsan mtp - eia gave no false negatives .    1.9700855173287812
each of the two cannabinoid assays gave false positive results in 13 % of the cases and for the mtp opiate assay 2 % of the positives could not be confirmed with gc - ms . as a result of our study the cut - off values for the mtp - eias have proved to be suitable for a distinction between potential positives and true negatives .    2.779702997126735
systemic karyomegaly associated with interstitial nephritis was first described in 1978 by UNK .    2.300130929582169
seven cases have been reported to date .    3.276998331175147
we give an account of an autopsy case of systemic karyomegaly in a 30 - year - old italian man .    2.3807437154741304
bizarre enlargement of nuclei was found in renal tubular epithelial cells , schwann cells and in smooth muscle cells of vessels and bowel and , less obviously , in endothelial and adventitial cells of vessels , in alveolar epithelial cells and in astrocytes of the brain .    2.227071552877024
these findings were associated with chronic interstitial nephritis , nonspecific UNK , adenocarcinoma of the rectum and multiple UNK .    2.669444395365019
the patient died 8 years after diagnosis in septic - toxic shock .    2.53453557227883
the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease are discussed .    3.360181160796719
17 % of malignant melanomas ( n = 100 ) investigated in a dermatologic practice were less than 6 mm in maximal diameter ( median diameter : 4 . 0 + / - 0 . 9 mm ) .    2.667551969806145
the median age of the 17 patients at diagnosis of small - diameter melanomas was 42 years .    2.5805431377652717
the essential epiluminescence microscopic and UNK features of these small melanomas resembled those of larger lesions , although their clinical criteria differed from the classic UNK .    2.0059268135741952
this percentage was nearly similar to those in situ lesions within the group of melanomas of 6 mm in diameter or larger ( 38 , 3 % ) .    2.42843226657175
the remaining 11 small lesions were classified as invasive from clark ' s level i to v , including all classic histogenetic types ( superficial spreading , nodular , UNK , desmoplastic ) .    2.097214471067238
the median thickness of the small invasive melanomas was 0 , 76 + / - 0 , 23 mm .    2.6396203835750747
the technique of epiluminescence microscopy allowed the identification of such malignant melanomas that could not be discerned by the naked eye or by a pocket - lens .    2.375209640902169
mycobacterium gordonae is an atypical mycobacterium of very low pathogenic potential .    2.192591412153919
it is widely distributed in UNK and water and often detected on the mucous membranes of healthy persons .    2.328645714647272
in recent years , there have been numerous reports of infections by m . gordonae in immunocompromised patients .    2.349182093268747
in contrast , only four cases of skin infections by m . gordonae in immunocompetent patients have been published .    2.3329335936916116
we report on another patient without evidence of immunodeficiency who developed an atypical UNK after a UNK injury during UNK .    2.2137383347736947
m . gordonae was isolated by tissue culture .    2.476718188397224
the skin lesion cleared completely after treatment with UNK for three months .    2.620038969956132
the article gives a review on oncocytic metaplasia and oncocytic tumors .    2.2918478597538967
biochemical , UNK and molecular genetic findings are discussed .    3.3201447178511785
it has been established , that defects of the respiratory chain occur predominantly in oncocytic foci of the UNK and the liver .    3.081100468000632
the underlying molecular genetic mechanisms are still unclear , however .    2.5365186657863688
in particular , one has to assume that oncocytic metaplasia differs pathogenetically from oncocytic neoplasia .    2.101277379543629
furthermore , organ - dependent prognostic differences of oncocytic tumors exist .    2.172644153855612
oncocytic carcinomas are predominantly seen in the thyroid and are scarce in other organs .    2.6005996483828957
the molecular genetic basis of this phenomenon is , however , still unknown .    3.275692614928435
the authors describe the feasibility of developing receptor - specific mr contrast agents for the improved detection of pathology and assessment of organ function .    2.3049423415324886
receptor specificity of mr contrast agents can be achieved by binding of receptor - specific carriers to ligands .    2.5222381294068263
this concept leads towards a decrease in dose and thus in toxicity .    2.51142260620249
specific attachment to parenchymal cells improves tumor - organ contrast and therefore tumor detection .    2.073681690622777
specific uptake mechanisms also enable the assessment of organ function .    2.527846478667747
future design concepts of novel mr contrast agents may consider the desired uptake in specific cells or organs ( UNK , adrenal glands , lymph nodes etc . )    2.24652480396589
with subsequent synthesis of appropriate carriers .    2.579436076485946
UNK UNK UNK can arise as a rare complication in patients with down syndrome .    3.221299506571648
it is one of the primary perforating disorders characterized by UNK elimination of abnormal elastic fibers .    2.7776248468699207
this may reflect an immunological reaction UNK elastic fibers .    2.197408080432544
we describe a 40 - year - old woman with down ' s syndrome whose skin lesions were histologically mistaken for lupus vulgaris for a long time .    2.1959403311485226
the position of the talus and the os calcaneum has consequences for the architecture of the forefoot .    2.531237610087899
medial tilting of the talus with vertical position provokes flattening of the medial arch and abduction of the forefoot .    2.4166196511357523
varus position of the calcis and lateral direction of the talus ( as in residual clubfoot ) , however , causes supination and adduction of the forefoot .    2.6500730161269326
repair of deformities in the hindfoot therefore also influences the forefoot .    2.242977493754325
a large number of various osteotomies have been proposed at both bones .    2.558186172951832
the most popular ones are dwyer ' s osteotomy at the corpus of the calcis and its modification described by mitchell at the same location for correction of the cavus foot and the residual clubfoot , and the lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to evans .    2.099753714608038
indication and operative technique of these three procedures are described in detail .    2.8092325341784465
the closing wedge osteotomy according to dwyer is indicated in cases of cavus feet .    2.671732731781201
in UNK the os calcis is usually too short and the medial opening wedge osteotomy provokes skin problems .    2.2968840089328513
in these cases an osteotomy according to mitchell with lateral displacement of the UNK UNK is more suitable .    3.0054933971074593
in flat - and UNK a lengthening osteotomy at the neck of the calcaneum according to evans can be indicated , especially when the load of the foot is UNK medially under the talus rather than at the lateral margin of the foot .    2.2685664851044742
if these procedures are carried out carefully , they have low complications rates .    2.1268813745949435
between january 1994 and august 1998 , 12 patients with 13 chronic infections after resection arthroplasty were treated successfully with vastus lateralis UNK .    2.145759536400688
one patient was suffering from chronic infection on both sides .    2.686387374332533
in all cases we found the infected cavity to be the origin of the persistent infection .    2.9956828856371565
the average duration of infection was 8 . 3 months .    2.800936311042608
the patients had undergone an average of 3 . 8 operations .    3.5427011089475138
up to now there was no recurrent infection , controlled by clinical investigation , ultrasound and laboratory findings in all 13 cases .    2.613044289235265
follow up investigation occured 2 . 5 years ( 1 . 5 - 4 . 7 ) after flap transfer .    3.2008042539095953
the flap is easy to harvest .    2.7956646719407585
he has a very constant pattern of vascular pedicle and a wide arc of rotation .    2.213857381224792
the functional deficits of donor side morbidity are minimal .    2.3820499934377937
that vastus lateralis flap seems to be an ideal procedure to stop draining infections due to infected cavities in the hip region .    2.31288456525732
information technologies have been integrated in gynecological oncology treatment and , therefore , new software has been established in hospitals and private clinics .    2.427260910625241
a german law for hospital tumor registration has attempted to UNK the different strategies .    2.6247094645465325
all UNK to establish new documentation systems for tumor diseases need a standardized basic data set .    2.0888117407898448
nevertheless , local governmental health organizations are not yet prepared to implement a global information system such as prenatal and perinatal care databases .    1.948807690505007
financial support and political work is therefore needed .    2.473606043442824
to UNK the microsurgical training in our clinic we organized a permanent possibility to practice microsurgical techniques of vascular anastomosis .    2.30433785238349
this includes stepwise education by means of plastic materials , human placenta and the rat model .    2.396177281178475
the most important role in this concept is played by the placenta .    2.8263393340886256
it supplies a realistic simulation of different in vivo situations concerning microvascular anastomosis .    2.080692424838268
as to availability , handling and costs the placenta is superior to animal models and has replaced them almost completely in our educational concept .    2.0766062690976637
since manfred bleuler ' s description of the clinical picture of late onset schizophrenia over 50 years ago , debate has persisted as to whether it is justifiable to differentiate this as a valid , independent entity from the group of classic schizophrenic disorders with early onset .    2.367045715349439
as this review shows , this question cannot be answered unequivocally even now .    2.2645162948528887
it must rather be UNK that we have neither been able to decisively extend our knowledge since manfred bleuler ' s comprehensive contribution , nor managed to achieve a much UNK basis UNK .    1.9027487669728724
the reasons for this are the international conceptual and UNK confusion that has developed around this illness group , and on the other hand the methodological limitations of the empirical studies conducted on this clinical picture so far .    2.2487702757918155
definition of the problem : in parallel with public and philosophical discussions , there is an ongoing debate about euthanasia in UNK ethics .    2.2011841191578307
in this situation it is helpful to provide a systematic overview of the different arguments and judgements .    2.5534533835261817
arguments : a short introduction is followed by a first part dealing with the definition of terms .    2.686142537641308
the second and major part concerning normative arguments is subdivided into three steps : the level of principles , the more concrete level of actions and finally the level of social consequences .    2.197877814875226
the third part presents some reflections following the UNK ethical tradition ( the ethics of a good life and death ) focusing on the central question : how to find meaning in life when faced with suffering .    2.0322043992936267
conclusion : it would be UNK to UNK the ethical reflection both on the problems concerning the foundations of social life , especially the meaning of dignity , autonomy and UNK of human life , and social consequences of a liberal practice of euthanasia .    2.430344651828515
in this context ethicists are challenged to reflect on the different approaches to what is or can be a good life and a human death .    2.0588305208337827
multimodal therapy of oral squamous cell carcinomas today is based on surgery , radiotherapy and chemotherapy .    2.7224955907857
despite the combination of all three therapeutic options , there is still a large number of treatment failures and therefore major questions remain .    2.799890595391082
recent investigations suggest that mutations of the p53 tumor UNK gene may account for some of the therapeutic failures .    2.5423211774005616
inactivation of the gene may be an important determinant of the UNK of today ' s multimodal therapy protocols .    3.2576027046796314
in 90 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity biopsy specimens were taken before and after preoperative radiochemotherapy .    2.6675323750846545
from all patients , biopsy and resection material was available for immunohistochemical analysis of p53 .    2.4918573196329032
after radiation treatment , 51 patients ( 57 % ) showed a complete response ; 39 patients ( 43 % ) only showed a partial response or did not respond at all .    2.437383730884484
among the responders , 82 % of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive , whereas among the UNK only 56 % of the pretherapeutic tumors were p53 positive .    2.461906760225101
the majority of the residual tumors were also p53 negative according to immunohistology after radiation treatment .    2.111591151267327
in our study , detection of p53 protein by immunohistochemistry seemed to be connected with a more UNK reaction of the tumors .    2.5587055813882476
the human cartilage and bone is characterized by a remodeling during the life , well balanced by neosynthesis and degradation of matrix components .    2.283497625511472
in different joint diseases , it becomes UNK and the destruction of the cartilage UNK the repair .    2.921385567499112
in tissue processes in disease and in normal turnover of the matrix , these molecules are fragmented and released into surrounding fluids , in the synovial fluid , and then in the blood and the UNK , where they can be detected .    2.765019980842248
the quantitative measurement in the synovial fluid is more specific than in the other body fluids .    2.638733884862954
the research process in recent years has suggested that these molecular markers of cartilage and bone matrix metabolism can be used to determine diagnosis , the disease severity rather than its presence or absence , the prognosis , and the response to therapy .    2.7427450782583733
they should help to identify the disease mechanism in different joint diseases not only on the tissue but also on the molecular level .    2.5150489837433767
the research in this area is still in the early stages , with most results dated from the end of the 1980s and the 1990s .    2.701415232430442
axillary block is a common anaesthetic technique for operations on the hand and forearm .    2.7554075735608015
in our hospital , with many UNK in anaesthesia , only 250 - 300 axillary blocks per year are performed by about 30 colleagues .    2.183443980910954
this implies a small number of blocks for each anaesthetist .    2.632230176135971
the present study was designed to assess whether it is possible to teach this technique and use it with an adequate degree of success under these conditions .    2.3235576123376873
we used a nerve stimulator and studied whether the success of the block under these conditions is independent of anaesthetist ' s experience in this technique .    2.254023882069057
furthermore , we examined other factors involved in the success of the block .    2.988107455701614
the study included 112 patients subjected to elective surgery of the upper extremity ; all received an axillary block .    2.3425255173864876
we used a nerve stimulator and injected mepivacaine 1 % without adrenaline .    1.9970783469365212
the following parameters were recorded : the number of blocks to date performed by the anaesthetist ; the minimal current required for nerve stimulation ; the dose of local anaesthetic ; the time between the end of injection and the beginning of surgery ; the duration of surgery ; and the quality of sensory and motor blockade after 10 , 20 , and 30 min .    2.701246392633226
sensory blockade was assessed by the UNK method ( no blockade , analgesia , anaesthesia ) ; motor blockade was judged by comparing the muscle strength of both arms ( no blockade , paresis , paralysis ) .    2.2000881087042097
data were analyzed using the mann - whitney test , with p < 0 . 05 considered statistically significant .    2.4172405177460177
of the 112 blocks , 95 ( 85 % ) were successful ; 17 ( 15 % ) failed and the patients required general anaesthesia .    2.4716090114480456
eight of the successful blocks showed a decrease in analgesic quality after > = 70 min and required additional analgesics or general anaesthesia .    2.176345591718757
we found no correlation between the experience of the anaesthetist and the success of the block .    2.799640154073488
the minimal required current for nerve stimulation in the success group was 0 . 4 ma and differed significantly from the value of 0 . 6 ma in the failure group ( table 3 ) .    2.549262667072061
the dose of mepivacaine was higher in the success group ( 5 . 9 vs . 5 . 3 mg / kg ) .    3.0670078582679596
complete sensory blockade was more frequently achieved for the median , ulnar , and radial nerves than for the musculocutaneous and cutaneous UNK UNK ( fig .    2.219171101780804
the frequency of complete sensory blockade ( anaesthesia ) had increased by 21 . 9 % between the 20th and UNK min .    2.423177049768214
complete motor blockade was less often achieved than sensory blockade ( fig .    2.241156003468485
prior to injection of the local anaesthetic , the current for nerve stimulation should be reduced to < 0 . 5 ma .    3.1155747207483713
the dose of mepivacaine should be no less than 6 mg / kg body weight .    2.6042155444250543
vascular endothelial growth factor ( vegf ) was discovered 10 years ago as a growth factor that can regulate angiogenesis and in addition the permeability of blood vessels .    2.211489737169695
numerous studies have revealed that it is essential for normal embryonic development and that it plays a major role in physiological and pathological events of angiogenesis in adults .    2.3631004328361174
it is unique in that its expression is regulated directly by hypoxia .    2.1914487891346086
these properties are now being exploited in attempts aimed at the induction of new blood vessels in pathological situations such as ischemic heart disease .    2.1558374392293076
five vegf forms of 121 to 206 amino - acids are produced from a single gene by alternative UNK .    2.0214514739248712
cells expressing vegf usually express several forms simultaneously .    2.265202797528728
vegf121 does not contain exons 6 and 7 of the gene and consequently lacks a heparin binding ability .    2.2048677520784863
however , this form is fully active as an UNK of angiogenesis , and as a blood vessel UNK agent .    2.581952145677721
exon 6 and 7 contain 2 independent heparin binding domains .    2.363247887456504
the vegf form containing exon 7 ( vegf165 ) and the vascular endothelial growth factor form containing exon 6 ( vegf145 ) display similar biological UNK raising the question of why so many vegf forms are required .    2.0531345018096183
it was found that vegf121 UNK better because it does not bind to UNK - sulfate proteoglycans .    2.283834950102168
in contrast , vegf145 binds to extracellular matrix ad is released from it slowly .    1.9410990241836423
when the receptor binding properties of vegf121 and vegf165 were compared it was found that vegf165 binds to a class of vegf receptors that is not recognized by vegf121 .    1.96042329020354
these receptors are encoded by the neuropilin - 1 gene , and we have recently found that the related neuropilin - 2 gene also UNK a vegf165 receptor .    2.155300763621348
we have recently found evidence indicating the UNK form complexes with another vegf receptor , UNK - 1 .    2.631268629211657
however , the biological function of this complex remains to be elucidated .    2.5632264797794715
in addition to mucositis and UNK as well known early reactions after radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy in advanced head and neck tumors , late toxicity following treatment is an often underestimated problem .    2.132769766040957
the healing of wounds by secondary intention is a simple method to close operative defects .    2.3791851234769807
the quality of wound healing will depend on the anatomic site on the face as well as on size and depth of the defect .    2.944605484955838
best functional and cosmetic results are obtained at locations with concave geometry and when the defect lies UNK at the interface of two anatomic subunits .    2.369548237398637
partial reconstruction or guiding sutures can create a symmetric defect in relation to anatomic subunits which will heal by second intention .    1.994912920628029
this simple and efficient operative procedure is UNK by two case reports .    2.7848808078172067
background : acute infectious UNK ( im ) is a UNK lymphoproliferative disease of ebv - infected ( UNK ) b cells and poly - / oligoclonal cytotoxic t cells which are to a high percentage ebv - specific .    2.352175603291549
in b cells ebv infection mainly leads to a latent infection with expression of ebv nuclear antigens 1 - 6 ( UNK - 6 ) and membrane antigens 1 , 2a and 2b ( UNK , UNK and UNK ) .    2.773069471061394
expression of these ebv latent antigens leads to transformation and UNK of infected b cells .    2.4999932959007025
here we examined if also lytic ebv genes ( i . e .    2.115123584486034
UNK ) , which are associated with a productive ebv infection , are expressed during im .    3.3677017205998636
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy ( arvcm ) is a frequent underlying disease in young patients with ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) and sudden death .    2.4950134875159704
treatment is frequently indicated and is mainly directed at the prevention of ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death .    2.4254860995571246
a prospective study was performed to compare the sensitivity and accuracy of ultrasound ( us ) , computed tomography ( ct ) , and single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) as a bone scan to detect subclinical invasion of the mandible by squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity and floor of mouth .    2.78008591322201
the typical clinical features of myasthenia gravis are weakness and excessive fatiguability of striated muscles that increases during the course of the day or after UNK exercise .    2.4023281106188348
ocular muscle involvement with UNK ( in 50 % ) and diplopia ( in 25 % ) are the most common initial signs .    3.3539324944357642
the disease can progress to bulbar muscles and to all other striated muscles ( generalized myasthenia ) .    2.0974736208437816
the muscle fatiguability and a fluctuating course can UNK to a diagnosis of UNK .    2.6912683476583457
since the treatment of myasthenia gravis is directed at the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease an early diagnosis is of great significance for the course of the disease .    3.1478111774960853
also , a false positive diagnosis of myasthenia has to be avoided because of the potentially hazardous side effects of the therapy .    3.315633796408328
the mainstay of the diagnosis is the history and a subtle clinical examination with tests of excessive muscle fatiguability .    2.5535205893846658
the injection of edrophonium ( UNK ) , the UNK testing after UNK stimulation ( decrement test ) and the testing for serum antibodies against UNK receptors have to be performed to secure the diagnosis of myasthenia .    3.343541461741091
the edrophonium test and the decrement test can yield false positive results in other neuromuscular diseases .    2.2012061181140634
antibodies are present in 50 % of ocular myasthenia and in 80 - 90 % of the generalized form .    2.977969217296367
the lambert - eaton myasthenic syndrome , other neuromuscular diseases , mitochondrial diseases , diseases of the cranial nerves , UNK and the rare congenital myasthenic syndromes have to be considered as differential diagnosis .    2.720665717672087
the application of biodegradable implants is combined with advantages and UNK - UNK .    2.836474646850665
they offer a great deal of innovative ideas .    2.4724911118109545
best evaluation has been done with pins for the fixation of low loaded osteochondral fractures .    2.3174890146706075
when using 2 , 7 mm UNK primary mechanical UNK of distal radius fractures is comparable with the fixation by 1 , 8 mm k - wires .    2.168416760738031
a prospective and randomised study with two years follow up , including 183 radial head fractures , showed no significant difference in results and complications in metal and polyactide implants .    2.3752964334553397
for this localisation and other comparable indications the implant can be recommended .    2.408778052962292
despite the more extensive UNK device overall costs can be reduced with the polymer implant .    2.2091534226698926
UNK - UNK polyactide screws showed good clinical results , UNK resorption was extremely late within 5 to 7 years .    2.275494469714981
the treatment of deep cartilage defects is a challenge for every UNK surgeon .    2.5460671610140504
the established techniques induce the growth of fibrous tissue but fail to prevent arthrosis .    2.307985323814882
autologous chondrocyte transplantation seems to be the most promising therapy concept with clinical relevance to UNK a full thickness cartilage UNK with hyaline - like cartilage .    2.494527431638132
outcome studies with a follow up from 2 - 10 years show in up to 90 % good and excellent results for defects on the femoral condyle and 70 % for the patella .    2.774399602711883
mechanical testing of the UNK cartilage showed almost UNK stiffness as nearly normal hyaline cartilage .    2.672143695619403
the available data justify the acceptance of autologous chondrocyte transplantation as a standard procedure for limited indications and well - trained surgeons .    2.5124814152297734
result of already inaugurated studies will show the potential of chondrocyte transplantation to prevent osteoarthritis .    2.2578581453346946
vasculitides are rare diseases characterized by inflammation of blood vessels .    2.685276943140301
according to diameter of the blood vessels involved in the inflammatory process , the clinical presentation and the histological appearance , different UNK syndromes may be distinguished .    3.0405539254720146
primary vasculitides are of unknown origin while secondary vasculitides may be caused by drugs , malignancy or infection .    2.1646384876915246
panarteriitis UNK caused by chronic hepatitis b and mixed cryoglobulinemia secondary to chronic hepatitis c are classical examples of vasculitides triggered by infections .    2.0251388312355165
however , these are rare complications of chronic viral hepatitis .    2.535212239762369
patients infected by hiv frequently suffer from vasculitis , which may be caused by opportunistic infections and by defects in immune regulation .    2.3311658429909485
in numerous case reports , various other infectious particles have been reported to cause different forms of vasculitis , either by direct infection of endothelial cells or by induction of an immunologic process leading to blood vessel destruction .    2.2295587429977837
immunologically mediated vasculitis secondary to infection may be due to a predisposing reactivity of the patient ' s immune system .    3.003191520129106
after successful treatment of the infection , the vasculitis usually UNK .    2.824341930144006
to calculate canal compromise and decrease of midsagittal diameter caused by UNK of fragments into the spinal canal we analyzed the pre - and postoperative computed UNK of 32 patients with unstable thoracolumbar burst fractures treated by UNK ( universal spine system ) .    2.3654673321309145
our intention was to examine the efficiency of ultrasound guided repositioning of the UNK fragments which was performed in all 32 cases .    3.2265386412479264
we found a clear postoperative enlargement of canal area ( UNK preoperatively 55 % , postop .    2.098943080084676
80 % ) and midsagittal diameter ( msd preop .    2.905329206422428
10 of 13 patients presented a postoperative improvement of neurological deficit , no neurological deterioration occured .    2.2629235158980268
there was no correlation between the percentage of spinal canal stenosis and the severity of neurological deficit .    2.631684093406651
below l 1 the spinal canal is greater than between th 11 and l 1 , so a more important spinal stenosis is tolerated .    2.1605006668375455
in case of unstable burst fractures with neurological deficit the ultrasound guided spinal fracture reposition is an effective procedure concerning the necessary improvement of spinal stenosis : an additional ventral approach for the revision of the spinal canal is UNK .    2.1335546973556125
in fractures without neurologic deficit the repositioning of the displaced fragments promises an avoidance of long - term UNK such as UNK and claudicatio spinalis .    2.4626685872555396
in common the traumatic spondylolisthesis is not a life threatening injury .    2.745661218650939
especially the correct decision about the therapy ( operative vs conservative ) including the technical demanding operative procedures is based on an experienced surgeon .    2.3996400988177493
these patients should be transferred to a specialised centre .    2.9310320313289284
the intensity of dna degradation in fixed tissues is dependent on the fixation solution and the fixation time .    2.608697095568829
the aim of this study was the investigation of dna degradation over fixation times of up to 70 days in different tissues ( muscle , brain , liver , bone ) and with different formalin concentration ( 2 % , 4 % , 8 % ; UNK ) .    2.3828851617682387
an additional test was performed to see whether the fixed tissues could be individualized using pcr analysis .    2.40472796582523
the smallest amounts of dna were extracted from liver and brain and the largest from muscle and bone .    2.0486643480650906
the amount of dna that could be extracted decreased with increasing formalin concentration , while at the same time dna degradation increased .    2.381010629656577
with the pcr - UNK system UNK 01 , all fixed samples could be typed regardless of the fixation time and the formalin concentration .    2.333599917746678
the draining sinus is an unpleasant complication of acne conglobata , acne fulminans , acne UNK , rosacea conglobata and rosacea fulminans ( pyoderma faciale ) .    1.720473343408542
it is most common on the face , especially in the UNK UNK , and on the neck below the mandibular line .    3.679599090685466
clinically , it is an elongated ( 2 - 5 cm long ) , elevated , periodically inflamed lesion , which sporadically discharges pus .    2.526440992621342
the lesion persists with no tendency to spontaneous regression .    2.3570348039327698
histopathologically , it consists of elaborate , epithelialized UNK connected to the skin surface at multiple points .    2.213020439937851
it contains corneocytes , hairs , bacteria , serum , inflammatory cells and epitheloid granulomas .    2.0891016263304234
a surgical thread placed into the skin provides a model in which the generation of sinus UNK can be studied .    2.765750536108436
intralesional corticosteroid injection , cryosurgery and isotretinoin are not always very effective .    2.2527210383269844
sometimes complete excision of the lesion is necessary .    3.260510214884644
the draining sinus is a special form of scar analogous to the pilonidal cyst .    2.082931593572413
a thoracic outlet syndrome is only rarely caused by osseous anomalies .    2.274246693082571
instead , it is a soft - tissue disease , where the UNK and t1 roots or the proximal inferior trunk of the brachial plexus are compressed by fibromuscular anomalies between the inferior cervical spine and the first rib or pleura .    2.6028298667466605
thoracic outlet syndrome is a clinical diagnosis .    3.222140271515583
if surgery is recommended , it should be concentrated on the fibromuscular anomalies and not on the first rib .    2.7184802053530586
transaxillary removal of the first rib carries an important risk of serious complications .    3.177993814588366
among these , brachial plexus injury is the most frequent one .    2.8820369698740786
objective : the objective of this survey was to investigate the current status of the epidural and intrathecal management in patients with chronic cancer and non - cancer pain in germany and austria .    3.1237948420725914
methods : in june 1997 a questionnaire was sent to UNK german and austrian anaesthesiologists specialized in pain therapy .    2.0907753007329237
questions concerning the use of medicaments for epidural and intrathecal treatment of chronic pain were asked .    3.1542245285347237
results : the response rate was 23 % .    2.5522515221603572
the data show that 78 % of the anaesthesiologists use epidural or intrathecal analgesia in the therapy of chronic pain .    2.7658566191257115
local anaesthetics are used by 85 % of these anaesthesiologists , followed by morphine ( 72 % ) , clonidine ( 48 % ) , buprenorphine ( 34 % ) , baclofen ( 20 % ) , fentanyl ( 13 % ) and sufentanil ( 10 % ) .    3.122930076021151
for most of the treatments local anaesthetics are used , again followed by opioids und clonidine .    2.5151822616519066
in the 137 answering pain clinics 79 . 821 epidural and intrathecal analgetic treatments are performed per year .    1.9625360038128339
local anaesthetics followed by opioids are the most commonly used medicaments for this treatment .    2.587082875990849
for some of the applied substances UNK data are lacking .    2.889021934483918
the use of these substances has to be considered very carefully .    3.177770467450494
UNK conduction disturbances ( iacd ) are the known substrate of re - UNK atrial arrhythmias and their diagnosis is important for the selection of proper therapy .    2.494581161834896
signs of iacd can be missed on the standard ecg , and signal averaged ( sa ) p wave analysis has proved valuable for the evaluation of electrophysiological ( eps ) properties of atrial myocardium .    2.0487988611164907
unfavourable eps effects of raa pacing are known to UNK , but this aspect is rarely considered in normal practice , and raa based pacing modes remain standard even for pts .    2.3045916119248284
we examined and compared eps effects of different atrial pacing modes using two diagnostic tools : UNK obtained from two atrial leads of biatrial pacing system ( via telemetry ) and time domain analysis of sa p wave in 22 pts .    1.9435238891292437
with bia pacing system ( implanted due to atrial arrhythmias and iacd ) .    2.236172244386843
the results showed that different atrial pacing modes influence atrial activation timing parameters differently : raa pacing UNK iacd in comparison to sinus rhythm ; the effects of cs pacing is less visible .    2.1396648968879437
bia pacing UNK all atrial activation times .    2.443222289825511
the normalisation of sa p wave duration , reduction of sa p wave dispersion , increasing of rms 20 and decreasing of las 5 and finally UNK of presence of late atrial potentials in most of pts .    2.022728987892936
indicates beneficial effects of bia pacing ( in pts .    2.5553403709240214
with iacd ) in comparison to sinus rhythm and raa pacing .    2.8693597878624373
unfavourable eps effects of raa pacing in patients with iacd indicates suitability the need for alternative ( UNK ) atrial pacing modes .    3.019202091770924
time domain analysis of sa p wave is a valuable and sensitive diagnostic tool for non - invasive evaluation of eps effects of different modes of atrial pacing .    2.4908617029644793
background : we report a case of irreversible unilateral hypoglossal nerve palsy in connection with nasal septum surgery in intubation anaesthesia .    2.421658266341422
on account of the spatial distance , there is no danger of UNK the hypoglossal nerve during nasal surgery .    2.610765256211512
however , in the UNK and anaesthesiological literature , some cases of hypoglossal palsy following endotracheal intubation , use of the laryngeal mask airway , bronchoscopy and laryngoscopy are reported .    2.7299611650579467
the endoscopic guided puncture tracheostomy has established itself in many intensive care units .    2.1730984366650947
manufacturers offer complete tracheostomy kits , based on the described techniques from UNK ( cook - set ) , as well as from UNK ( UNK - set ) .    3.0021586579961923
the goal of this investigation was to show the advantages , disadvantages , costs and risks of the puncture tracheostomy and to make a comparison using conventional procedures .    2.3442290276208633
chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis may occur in children , adolescents and adults , but has not been found in newborns or babies either in our series or in the literature .    2.613231995058318
symptoms suggesting an acute disease like fever are uncommon , but a primary chronic course with symptomatic and asymptomatic periods is typical .    2.0026852813043075
pain and swelling are the main symptoms ; painless masses are rare .    2.574964520734979
in children and adolescents the clavicle and metaphyseal regions of long bones are typical sites of chronic UNK osteomyelitis .    2.3454340351691725
in adults the UNK or the first two ribs are mainly affected with synovitis of the adjacent joints , but the long bones are rarely involved .    2.55563888490495
laboratory findings are non - specific but important for the differential diagnosis .    2.983229946279287
the sedimentation rate and c - reactive protein might be elevated .    2.455509291418926
the x - ray examination shows osteolytic , sclerotic or mixed bony changes and , in case of a diaphyseal involvement , UNK periosteal bone formation may be present , suggesting a malignant process .    2.3182150646149187
uni - or multifocal lesions can be detected by UNK , as can asymptomatic lesions .    3.0308132647371946
magnetic resonance imaging shows gross signal intensity differences both in the bone and perifocal soft tissue and involvement of the synovium with gadolinium UNK enhancement in t1 - weighted images .    2.2938858938368165
in early stages of the disease granulocytes , UNK and new bone formations might suggest bacterial osteomyelitis that cannot be differentiated by histology .    2.7243777367828788
in intermediate phases lymphocytic and plasmacellular infiltrates are found , whereas in late phases sclerotic bone formations and fibrosis of the bone marrow are seen histologically .    2.2465188237228286
in chronic lymphoplasmacellular osteomyelitis , all clinical , radiological and histological findings , as well as negative bacteriological cultures , are mandatory and will allow a definitive diagnosis to be made .    2.311350185432836
the disease may be uni - or multifocal , and new bone lesions may occur over time , as well as skin manifestations , which can be found years before or after bone involvement .    2.5598838267913395
the association with dermatological diseases and / or synovitis led to the UNK UNK syndrome ( synovitis , acne , pustulosis , hyperostosis , osteomyelitis ) .    2.9081170857886613
for the treatment non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drugs are effective for pain relief , reduction of swelling and dysfunction .    2.5288358330322773
antibiotics have been used in several series and are not effective .    2.8611620209084943
major surgery is not recommended even for recurrences , and the prognosis for growth and function is excellent in the long term despite recurrences over several years .    2.7409094359480792
a woman with severe stiff - man syndrome showed UNK cardiovascular dysregulation .    2.42270399751274
the blood pressure changed spontaneously every 5 - 10 min .    2.7523781380430785
this rhythm was also maintained after relaxation .    2.439968816831844
however , the vegetative and motoric disturbances disappeared after intrathecal application of baclofen .    2.0692711596608535
it is UNK that spinal UNK mechanisms are responsible for the tonic regulation of the cardiovascular system .    2.5499577433211478
the frequency and prognostic relevance of sarcoid - UNK and microcarcinosis in regional lymph nodes in gastric cancer ( n = 113 ; UNK - 3 , pn0 - 1 , UNK , r0 ) were investigated ; the prognostic value was compared with pt and pn stage , grading and UNK ' s tumor classification with cox ' s multivariate regression - model .    2.543727340565261
sarcoid like lesions were found in 34 % of the cases ( n = 113 ) .    3.5408834717077364
statistical analysis did not indicate that they had any prognostic value or showed whether or not microcarcinosis or metastasis was present ; they were independent of pt stage , histological tumor type , tumor grading , and the clinical course of disease .    2.4190276089275096
microcarcinosis ( defined as scattered carcinoma cells within lymph node sinuses or UNK without adjacent stromal reaction ) was revealed by immunohistochemistry in 90 % of pn0 cases ; the presence of 3 or more tumor cells per lymph node section in over 10 % of sampled lymph nodes per case carried a significant prognostic value .    2.0655590159980237
in microcarcinosis without evidence of metastasis , the number of tumor cells and the number of involved lymph nodes are of prognostic value .    3.062400594624081
in pn1 cases microcarcinosis was found as well as the metastases in 97 % and had no additional prognostic value .    2.55089929954623
microcarcinosis alone has a different significance from lymph node metastasis for prognosis .    2.2222302844111526
this article summarizes the most important results of the turku conference on active strategies for an aging UNK , which took place in turku / finland in 1999 .    2.3486562074100195
about 140 experts from all eu - member states participated .    2.1541561953046413
the article can be seen as a contribution to the current change in the debate on labor market policy concerning older workers in germany .    2.4647061262239855
the incidence of coronary artery aneurysm varies in the range from 0 . 2 % to 4 . 9 % .    3.6724504940094964
ninety per cent of these were associated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease , where vessel UNK and poststenotic dilatations are not an infrequent finding .    2.427286116304002
we present the case of a 67 year old patient with coronary artery aneurysm and coexisting coronary artery disease of the right coronary artery .    3.114765111558357
the patient was symptomatic and had a posterolateral myocardial infarction .    2.4415872934027063
after the procedure , the patient could be discharged without angina pectoris .    2.9725165604150106
a control - angiography will be performed six months later .    2.385714973005645
tmlr ( transmyocardial laser revascularization ) is a disputed UNK technique available in europe since 1994 that aims to deliver additional blood flow to ischemic myocardium from the left heart chamber .    2.0517064960194835
goal of our study is morphological examination of laser channels in human hearts to answer the questions : are there patent laser channels with communication to the left chamber and to intramural vessels ?    2.1831869468161735
we examined hearts of 10 patients who died during the first 18 days after tmlr .    2.792654915277486
channels were examined in histological serial sections under the light microscope .    2.471382457909477
laser channels in the first days postoperatively have a lumen diameter of about 1 mm and are surrounded by coagulation necrosis about 500 µm thick .    2.166069135495454
despite UNK removal of necrotic tissue the lumen diameter decreases during the following two weeks .    2.2193895290092325
open UNK channels can be shown in all patients .    2.667898513600386
these channels communicate with intramural vessels , but in no instance with chamber lumen .    2.2324506593234754
our results suggest that clinical benefits are based on improved distribution of coronary blood .    2.609517375148971
additional blood is not delivered from left chamber lumen to the myocardium .    2.225968781485106
however , our patients represent the small subgroup of the deceased .    2.3661717580490573
if similar observations can be made in the majority of patients living symptomfree after tmlr remains open .    2.694990551305669
recurrent miscarriages are , like sporadically occurring UNK , often ( approx .    2.1507502611367064
50 % ) due to chromosomal aberrations .    3.183031138883511
an undefined proportion of the other half may be due to immunological UNK .    2.6780878369361893
the basis for this assumption is the fact that the maternal immune system recognizes paternal antigens and UNK them .    2.604745304070585
the initial hypothesis that such immune reaction is due to a high similarity between the maternal and paternal hla systems ( hla UNK ) is most likely incorrect .    2.4386569982815103
nevertheless , the incomplete recognition of the fetus by the maternal immune system and the resulting insufficient protection is basis for the active immune therapy with partner or donor lymphocytes .    2.361692213279742
several placebo - controlled studies have been performed .    3.1672559646242617
due to the small number of cases , results were not significant .    3.1122116336666568
a metaanalysis of all studies , however , proves significant effects of the active immune therapy .    2.943638497159347
the risks of active immune therapy led to the development of passive immune therapy with immune globulins ( ivig ) .    2.6599239119021862
this therapy , however , is relatively expensive and obviously no more successful than the active immune therapy .    2.399124430133338
in a metaanalysis of all published results , ivig was not significantly more effective than treatment with placebo .    2.4457198254581343
the indication for both forms of immune therapy is given after 3 or more consecutive abortions , after exclusion of other reasons for these abortions .    2.1581800419746116
it appears that only primary aborting patients are suitable for active immune therapy .    2.3198929301026068
UNK the concept of immune therapy is still under debate , alternative concepts are not available .    2.80073236727151
hence , new therapeutic approaches are also not available .    2.7591293279282723
the first electronic implantable hearing aids for patients with hearing loss are coupled to the ossicular chain or perilymph during implantation and are now available .    2.4594095463173775
our new tübingen implant designed for sensorineural hearing loss ( snhl ) is the combination of an implantable microphone and piezotransducer .    2.5670602585756166
to avoid hearing losses during implantation , the tübingen piezotransducer will be ( 1 ) fixed to the mastoid cavity and ( 2 ) positioned to one of the ossicular target points .    2.6437622174819295
this can be done with a micromanipulator which will be implanted together with transducer and microphone in the mastoid cavity .    2.19289592204528
the manipulator weights 0 . 7 g . with four degrees of freedom , it allows highly secure and safe positioning of the transducer ' s probe tip to the ossicular chain under close to stereotactic conditions .    2.1609994067186586
the main advantages of the present micromanipulator are ( 1 ) easy handling during surgery , ( 2 ) the transducer ' s precise positioning to the ossicular target point with sufficient degrees of freedom , and ( 3 ) the transducer ' s stable fixation in the mastoid cavity in the final position .    2.5551957794224665
following integrated safety as the leading principle , ossicular or inner ear injuries caused , e . g . , by the patient ' s head movement or unintentional manual contact by the surgeon , are minimized .    2.2587148022248806
the manipulator ' s development and its optimization to the mastoid cavity by test implantation in 50 human temporal bones are shown in detail .    2.0044279102913305
while coupling the transducer to the body of the incus , transducer , microphone , and micromanipulator can be implanted into 76 % of all mastoid cavities without protrusion .    2.223064184167056
in the case of transducers coupling to the long process of the incus , the protrusion - free implantation rate of the above - mentioned three implant modules is 78 % .    2.1615074128589584
the role of neuroimaging in the acute setting of head trauma is to diagnose the extent of intracranial injury and to identify all lesions which require urgent neurosurgical treatment .    2.2639965932984776
computed tomography ( ct ) remains the most important diagnostic tool for initial screening of trauma victims .    2.9118173466690593
although magnetic resonance imaging ( mr ) has higher sensitivity to most traumatic lesions than ct , due to the ease and speed of ct , and the fact that sufficient monitoring of critically ill patients during the examination is much easier with ct than with mr , mean that mr is not the imaging modality of choice for the initial diagnostic work - up .    2.5204484832424514
recent mr techniques such as flair or diffusion imaging further improve the sensitivity of mr in head trauma .    2.253269247281928
conventional angiography is currently indicated only for few suspected vascular lesions ( e . g .    2.1273126367180337
traumatic arterio - venous fistulas , vascular dissections ) .    2.305626589731278
injuries to the posterior cruciate ligament are among the major injuries to the knee joint .    3.2310088386402738
today we are often confronted with an UNK and delayed diagnosis of this injury and its concomitant lesions .    2.4728807898944023
additionally , the outcome of operative treatment has not yet reached an acceptable rate of satisfactory results .    2.517931909013676
therefore , the goal of this current concept review is to give a comprehensive insight into anatomy and biomechanics , injury mechanisms and UNK , based on our experiences and data from the international literature .    2.6470731000425936
a further goal is to clarify diagnostic problems with respect to clinical examination and imaging techniques .    2.8224541603507625
we also present a differential concept for the perioperative and conservative management of posterior cruciate ligament deficient knees in order to also adequately address concomitant injuries such as posterolateral rotatory instability and combined anterior cruciate ligament injuries with the aim of further improving results .    2.267025083032965
sevoflurane , like all currently used volatile anaesthetics , is degraded by carbon dioxide absorbents .    2.1447532917626884
the most significant UNK is a UNK known UNK as " compound a " .    3.015596177941827
compound a is nephrotoxic in rats and , at higher doses , in UNK primates , causing proximal tubular necrosis .    2.258028688815585
there has been much interest in the potential for compound a toxicity in humans .    2.338862788263855
inhaled compound a concentrations are greatest at low flow rates , high sevoflurane concentrations , UNK absorbent , barium hydroxide vs soda lime , and UNK absorbent .    2.1677460991702984
typical inspired compound a concentrations during low - flow and closed - circuit sevoflurane anaesthesia in humans are 8 - 24 and 20 - 32 ppm with soda lime and barium hydroxide lime , respectively .    2.002983897123273
renal effects of compound a production during sevoflurane anesthesia have been examined in surgical patients and volunteers , using standard ( creatinine clearance , serum UNK and creatinine ) and experimental ( urine excretion of protein , glucose , nag , UNK , aap ) markers of renal function .    2.088625420903146
investigations to date in surgical patients show similar renal effects of low - flow sevoflurane , low - flow isoflurane or high - flow sevoflurane .    2.8000455202320946
there have been no case reports of compound a - associated renal injury in humans .    2.3490837710261423
in volunteers , one study found changes in experimental but not conventional renal markers , while other investigations show no significant changes in either standard or experimental markers .    1.9602407814757734
the mechanism of compound a nephrotoxicity in rats appears to involve metabolism to glutathione and cysteine UNK , and their subsequent renal uptake and metabolism by pathways that are different in rats and humans .    2.140149381527119
in the report of the 1995 world health federation / international society and federation of cardiology ( UNK / isfc ) task force on the definition and classification of cardiomyopathies , the definition of heart muscle diseases was updated .    2.061960402190342
UNK , UNK and UNK are considered as main UNK factors in the pathogenesis of inflammatory heart disease .    3.3959802381209636
recurrent csf UNK and meningitis lead to extensive diagnostic procedures .    2.2798520817456738
operative exploration of the temporal bone demonstrated a fracture line along the horizontal part of the carotid artery .    2.6921431057625447
the location of the fracture did not cause such typical symptoms as hearing impairment , facial paralysis , vertigo or tinnitus .    2.2022190546267386
only csf liquorrhea through the eustachian tube indicated a fracture at the lateral skull base .    2.2342538465073187
hyperkeratosis UNK UNK ( UNK ' s disease ) is a rare but clinically and histologically highly characteristic genodermatosis .    3.5046146317833746
we report on new immunohistochemical and ultrastructural findings suggesting a complex disorder of epidermal differentiation .    2.0604232633520003
in this context , a good response to calcipotriol , a synthetic vitamin d3 derivative is of particular interest .    2.176871250509224
pulmonary embolism is a frequent and potentially life - threatening event with uncharacteristic clinical manifestations .    2.502587763853661
diagnosis is commonly established by ventilation / perfusion scintigraphy and pulmonary angiography .    2.2318320150173085
both methods , however , carry substantial drawbacks .    3.1185960454608543
therefore , clinicians claim that there is a need for an accurate and non - invasive diagnostic modality .    2.942897942285558
spiral ct of the pulmonary arteries is a recent modality , that allows reliable visualization of emboli in pulmonary arteries up to fourth - order branches .    2.1839516919515645
this paper reviews the technical aspects , typical findings and diagnostic pitfalls of this recent technique .    2.0560228975084
the potential role of spiral ct in the screening of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism is discussed and selected cases are presented .    3.046240589670351
introduction : interleukin - 12 - p70 ( il - 12 - p70 ) is a potent UNK cytokine composed of a heavy chain ( p40 ) and a light chain ( UNK ) .    2.4719072034313068
UNK results have been reported with regard to leukocyte release and systemic concentration of il - 12 after polytrauma .    3.0146338192195206
methods : we daily analyzed systemic concentrations of il - 12 in polytrauma patients ( n = 37 , mean iss 33 . 9 ) in comparison to healthy donor values during intensive care course by elisa .    2.3629602937292202
patients were divided according to their mean il - 12 levels into those with elevated il - 12 ( group 1 , n = 7 ) , those with decreased il - 12 ( group 2 , n = 4 ) and those with il - 12 in the normal range ( group 3 , n = 26 ) .    2.9749246355260133
results : patients in group 1 revealed elevated levels of il - 12 up to p70 > 1000 pg / ml and p40 > 2500 pg / ml .    2.4477123907224847
the common clinical feature of group 1 was a thorax trauma in combination with pneumonia ( 85 % survivors ) .    2.4217493705546347
patients with single thorax trauma or pneumonia without thorax trauma ( group 3 ) showed normal il - 12 values .    2.2406883349322135
the groups significantly differ in their stay in the intensive care unit , in tiss , in mods score and in respiratory ratio , but not in iss , mean crp values and leukocyte counts .    2.181713225687768
correlation analysis revealed no significant relation between UNK altered il - 12 values and clinical parameters , with the exception of a negative correlation of p70 and iss ( r = - 0 . UNK ) or mods score ( r = - 0 . UNK ) in group 1 .    2.7014661265098265
conclusions : after major injuries there is no overall suppression of il - 12 formation .    2.7422406408593165
patients with normal or elevated il - 12 levels belong mainly to the survivors , whereas patients with decreased il - 12 levels are at high risk of UNK to multi - organ failure .    2.563810103246546
this article reviews the pathogenesis and clinical and imaging findings in shoulder impingement syndrome .    2.249968788032769
shoulder impingement is caused by compression of the supraspinatus tendon UNK the UNK arch , mainly in forward flexion of the arm .    2.6799384911621567
different stages of impingement syndrome are described .    2.6305737498287542
stage i relates to edema and hemorrhage of the supraspinatus tendon .    2.3703413351199454
stage ii is characterized by UNK inflammation and fibrosis , as well as tendinopathy .    3.349656043500926
moreover , calcifying tendinitis , fractures and pain originating from the cervical spine may mimic shoulder impingement syndrome .    2.2481712641531395
imaging is important for the exact diagnosis .    3.374166245326308
standard radiographs are the basis of imaging in shoulder impingement syndrome .    2.708689042577506
they may demonstrate subchondral sclerosis of the major tuberosity , subacromial spurs , and form anomalies of the acromion .    2.1962165659242587
they are also important in the differential diagnosis of shoulder impingement syndrome and demonstrate calcifying tendinitis , fractures and neoplasm .    2.497043695446324
ultrasonography has found acceptance as a screening tool and even as a final diagnostic method by many authors .    2.311777880909402
however , there is a high interobserver variability in the demonstration of rotator cuff tears .    2.7904120962948635
its usefulness has therefore been questioned .    2.7200279881244143
mr imaging is probably the method of choice in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and surrounding structures .    3.0807952078197967
several investigations have demonstrated that differentiation of early findings , such as tendinopathy versus partial tears , may be difficult with mr imaging .    2.5657855664267486
however , reproducibility for full - thickness tears appears to be higher than for sonography .    2.536184368497163
moreover , specificity appears to be superior to sonography .    2.9551397546514004
mr arthrography is not UNK accepted .    3.0166287901612034
however , it allows for more exact differentiation of discrete findings and may be indicated in preoperative planning .    2.487502795300226
standard arthrography and ct have a limited role in the current assessment of the rotator cuff .    3.200413121279074
gastric carcinoma of the infiltrative type ( according to UNK ) occasionally shows adenomatous differentiation only .    2.704696331450747
over the past 18 years , we have observed 23 cases of this tumour type , accounting for 3 . 6 % of all surgically treated gastric carcinomas .    2.8786205620765837
macroscopically they were classified as UNK iv or iii , while histologically most of them were well differentiated .    2.4072441217330813
histologically , these tumours retained the pre - existing structures of the stomach , most readily observable at the tunica muscularis propria ; a pronounced desmoplasia was also characteristic , particularly in the submucosal and UNK layers .    2.1442372255170907
all but 2 cases with UNK involved lymph nodes , often small , showed infiltration of the lymph node sinus ; in three quarters of cases the UNK was infiltrated by the tumour .    2.523189385653842
significant findings among the patients under observation for extended periods included bilateral ovarian metastases in 4 of 5 women examined and tumour recurrence at the anastomosis in 6 of 9 patients in whom UNK ii operation had been performed .    2.039274991766246
the mean survival time of 16 patients was 14 . 9 months .    2.719858012482093
owing to the diffuse type of tumour growth , extensive surgery is recommended as in cases of UNK ring cell cancer .    2.6732434445702684
the high incidence of small lymph node metastases from this type of tumour should also be taken in account at preoperative staging .    2.6015083849615777
preoperative diagnosis of this tumour subtype is difficult , because histological criteria alone do not allow clear identification .    2.422423092162349
close cooperation with clinical investigators is necessary , and intraoperative assessment of the tumour - including frozen section of necessary - in particular is of the UNK importance .    2.764348536287459
one rare case of so - called massive idiopathic osteolysis UNK - UNK is presented .    3.125919537067657
in a 77 - year - old female patient the whole right femoral head and neck of femur was resorbed within 2 . 5 month following trauma .    2.54464738878132
as a histologic cause for the osteolysis , a marked stimulation of UNK on the spongiosa , especially UNK , was observed .    2.5289743884614024
the course and the clinical findings are described , and the pathogenesis and treatment are discussed in comparison with the present literature .    3.9727220369393628
the results suggest that an early UNK therapy ( calcitonin , UNK ) could stop the progressive osteolytic changes .    2.699342836775078
in this paper the relationship between psychodiagnosis and client - centered therapy is discussed .    2.4020867208965875
UNK is UNK said to have rejected any kind of diagnosis and that this therapy form has therefore developed an ambiguous relationship to this issue .    2.2510390593471414
if one UNK psychodiagnosis as something psychodynamic , and symptoms as defense strategies against underlying conflicts , then a comprehensive ' status diagnosis ' using more or less traditional psychiatric categories appears compatible with theory - led client - centered diagnosis in the initial phase and during the course of therapy .    1.9460400571101302
client - centered psychotherapy itself may be seen as a continuous process of dialogue in which ' assumed diagnoses ' ( embedded in the therapist ' s ' empathic knowledge ' ) are jointly checked and in which the client through direct experience UNK to understand and change his ' diagnosis ' .    1.9754123575577278
in the examination of reversible segmental ( articular ) UNK dysfunction ( blockage ) of the spine , we have to recognize by palpation the feeling of beginning resistance at the end of the passive movement ( " barrier " ) .    2.360323911346326
this is the main finding to diagnose segmental ( articular ) dysfunction .    2.3430779162186957
normal mobility gives us a slowly increasing resistance with possible springing at the end .    2.314517357861866
in contrary , the sudden feeling of hard tension without springing is seen as typical for the restricted movement in articular dysfunction , i . e . restriction of joint facet gliding .    2.0244998077784864
multiple intra - and UNK lymph nodes develop in the parotid gland , including salivary gland tissue with acinar and ductal formations .    2.429750142856836
in the same way heterotopic salivary gland tissue can be localized in cervical lymph nodes .    2.5431922030344083
except for the frequently occurring warthin tumours , primary salivary gland tumours , which develop in the lymph nodes of the parotid gland or the cervical lymph nodes , are rare .    2.5651027576431975
examples of these are adenomas ( pleomorphic adenoma , basal cell adenoma ) and carcinomas ( acinic cell carcinoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma , sebaceous gland carcinoma ) .    2.0396686865183065
three of our own observations ( sebaceous UNK , acinic cell carcinoma , mucoepidermoid carcinoma ) are analysed .    2.1455847593860824
the condition for the diagnosis of primary salivary gland tumour within a lymph node is reliable evidence that the salivary gland tissue is tumour - free and that no other occult carcinoma is present .    2.3985087426500997
we report on a three month old infant presenting with vaginal bleeding .    2.183166847561909
precocious UNK due to an autonomous ovarian cyst was diagnosed .    2.8169754349737084
within three months the follicular cyst spontaneously regressed .    2.4624337758482038
elevated estradiol levels also decreased spontaneously .    2.4288806439886974
the purpose of this study was to determine whether 24 hour patch testing with 0 . 5 % sodium UNK sulphate ( sls ) could reliably predict skin susceptibility to an irritant when compared with the alkali resistance test ( art ) , a widely used method employing sodium hydroxide .    2.2101793331797364
the skin responses to sls were assessed both visually and by measurement of UNK water loss ( tewl ) as an indicator of stratum UNK integrity .    2.0808565868011923
sls significantly increased the erythema scores and tewl in patients with healed icd , and the increase of tewl was even more pronounced in patients with active icd .    3.1312812175440756
by contrast , a decrease in alkali resistance was found in patients with active icd only but not in patients with healed icd .    3.240808701750812
the data obtained indicate that the sls test , unlike art , may provide a non - invasive tool predicting a possible constitutional skin susceptibility or indicating a UNK impaired epidermal barrier function .    2.1376574839810925
however , because of the relatively high interindividual variation , a cut - clear statement concerning the skin susceptibility cannot be made by this test .    2.4390089601312255
on the other hand , the art seems only to be useful for following and documenting the healing period following icd .    2.136210560818507
introduction : the correction of low to moderate astigmatism is possible today by means of UNK ( prk ) , while the treatment of moderate and higher astigmatism still involves refractive keratotomy .    2.989143880674532
experience has shown that cataract surgery , using modern tunnel techniques with self - healing incisions , results in earlier stability in both the refractive outcome and wound healing .    2.159123943173303
in this study , we attempted to combine the advantages of lamellar keratotomy with those of a pair - UNK t - incision as arcuate lamellar keratotomy ( alk ) .    2.145836322600805
an often unrecognized but potentially fatal complication , mostly seen in posttraumatic patients under intensive care , is reactive acute cholecystitis .    2.132198060060705
on account of the high specificity of ultrasound diagnosis in the biliary system we decided to examine the ultrasound criteria for early detection of posttraumatic cholecystitis .    2.590592258169843
ultrasound of the abdomen was performed prospectively , seven times on different days , in each of 40 artificially respirated patients under intensive care conditions over a period of 12 months .    2.170215643898452
the results show that artificial respiration , parenteral feeding and previous trauma can lead to UNK ( 28 / 40 ) UNK or to a three - layered wall of the gallbladder ( 9 / 40 ) .    2.570726247744282
in 22 . 5 % of patients ( 9 / 40 ) we found the sonographic signs of acute cholecystitis .    3.387539447381146
in correlation with the clinical signs , cholecystectomy was indicated in only two patients .    3.062721685661769
the preoperative UNK findings and clinical signs of 23 patients with the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis were analysed retrospectively .    3.0997214173638734
we found good correlation between sonographic and clinical signs of acute cholecystitis in 21 of these 23 patients .    2.3339052310524293
our study shows that the morphological correlate of a UNK three - layered gallbladder wall can occur in the context of systemic alterations , even if there is no underlying cholecystitis .    2.7380362668845546
the diagnosis of acute reactive cholecystitis and the indication for cholecystectomy should be based on the synopsis of pathologic and clinical findings .    2.7227327480562638
osteoporosis is characterized by reduced bone mass and a deterioration of bone structure which results in an increased fracture risk .    2.5941184937206088
the purpose of this review is to evaluate structure analysis techniques in the diagnosis of osteoporosis .    2.727662376937009
several imaging techniques were applied to analyze trabecular bone , such as conventional radiography , high - resolution computed tomography ( hr - ct ) and high - resolution magnetic resonance imaging ( hr - mri ) .    2.8738224598054862
the best results were obtained using high - resolution tomographic techniques .    2.696596640368723
the highest spatial resolutions in vivo were achieved using hr - mri .    2.168944639115779
these studies show that texture parameters and bone mineral density predict bone strength and osteoporotic fractures in a complementary fashion .    2.0862870025706046
combining both techniques yields the best results in the diagnosis of osteoporosis .    3.1302812125707478
classification of cosmetics , which are more and more similar to topical therapeutic agents , is getting increasingly difficult for dermatologists .    2.530397869394537
their definition within the eu and the respective european directives , replacing national laws step by step , will be briefly presented .    1.9440690379578232
the problems of distinguishing cosmetics from medicinal products will be UNK in detail by examples from clinical practice .    2.2473139004844738
finally , we will review the various active substances which tend to be added to cosmetics following the global trend in the cosmetic industry towards developing " UNK " active cosmetics , and in the pharmaceutical industry towards " cosmetically " oriented medicinal products as part of a current " life - style " UNK .    2.1326331319396528
in some clinical dermatological fields these active substances may allow the dermatologists to use cosmetics as topical therapeutic agents .    1.9687021722475981
the decision whether a rotator cuff tear has a traumatic or degenerative origin still causes some controversy .    2.007122462017058
especially in medical expert UNK the etiology of the rotator cuff tear plays an important role refering to insurance services for the patient .    2.544333679669783
the purpose of this paper is to compare the intraoperative UNK shape of the cuff tear in traumatic and degenerative cases .    2.406828684010439
this study reports of 56 patients with rotator cuff tears which were UNK in primarily acute , subacute traumatic and degenerative study groups refering to their history of present illness .    2.089577778076798
we considered the location of the tear , the shape and the size .    2.5968544833377
furthermore the grade of retraction of the supraspinatus tendon , its quality and the shape of the long head of biceps were examined .    2.3519630685267003
the results showed that in general the shape of the tear gives only in some cases significant information whether the etiology is traumatic or not .    2.4707539231522775
the isolated rupture of the subscapularis muscle and the hematoma at the edge of the tendon is UNK for the trauma .    2.7507514329681837
in comparison with the degenerative study group the UNK and the dislocation of the long head of biceps is in our study UNK for traumatic tears .    2.8514296514350455
health care decision making in UNK severely ill patients presents many difficult medical , ethical , and legal problems for the physician .    2.200038104166336
at the same time nurses represent the group of medical professionals who have the closest contact with the patient and who have to carry out most of the decisions and instructions .    2.692682649548485
UNK ' s disease is produced by short hairs that penetrate the interdigital spaces of the hands .    2.458693917632904
the following chronic inflammatory reaction causes fistulas or sinuses and cysts .    2.2078453023714197
we present the case of a patient with interdigital pilonidal sinuses of all web spaces in both hands .    2.1998750535688325
such an extensive case of this occupational disease has so far not been reported .    2.4305187398335266
the treatment of critically ill patients compromises frequently between an adequate fluid resuscitation for maintenance of a sufficient regional perfusion on the one hand and the avoidance of pulmonary edema on the other hand .    2.3702187384147515
the application of the transpulmonary indicator dilution method allows the orientation of fluid therapy by using the parameters ' intrathoracic blood volume ' and ' extravascular lung water ' .    2.1116651080306847
this technique is less invasive than the pulmonary artery catheter since it only needs a 3 or 4 french catheter in the femoral artery .    2.2479250474053876
additionally , controlling the fluid therapy with the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is severely limited in the mechanically ventilated patient .    2.0449792949577215
therefore , the intrathoracic blood volume may be of advantage in the critically care patient in comparison to the pulmonary capillary wedge pressure to assess the cardiac preload .    2.568095050717496
furthermore , the indocyanine clearance adds a valuable parameter to assess liver function when the double indicator technique is used .    1.9713028490235331
hypnosis , autogenic training , progressive relaxation and UNK show good empirical evidence concerning relaxation - therapy and are useful techniques in psycho - or behavior - therapy .    1.9740069039696189
though they share some aspects with body - oriented psychotherapy these relaxation - techniques show a modern scientific orientation and are therefore to seperate from religious UNK .    1.9315231107731223
though in details somewhat different , the methodology of these techniques creates a framework , in which the psychophysiological determined relaxation response is easily elicited .    2.235020086295457
however , regular practice of the patients is UNK .    3.1300678719590564
focussed attention , imagination and new UNK of bodily or mental perceptions play a dominant role concerning the therapeutic effects , which may contribute to enhanced internal UNK and UNK .    2.244244694580089
controlled clinical studies give evidence to positive effects concerning various psychosomatic disorders ( e . g .    2.0417205467158
headache , pain , UNK .    3.1940889208603425
hypertension ) , as well as anxiety and sleeping disorders .    3.0417165395648595
as components of psychotherapeutic or behavioral programs , there is even more evidence for effects of relaxation in a broad spectrum of disorders ( e . g .    2.2286597579688197
relaxation therapy is a well established and scientific - based component in the treatment of psychic , psychosomatic or psychiatric disorders , except psychosis .    2.7921011006289267
juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare autosomal recessive connective tissue disease first described in UNK by murray .    2.7702672091085523
major diagnostic criteria are multiple cutaneous tumors and gingival hypertrophy ; minor criteria include UNK , osteolytic lesions and a positive family history .    2.2414094888672733
a 35 - year - old woman suffering from crohn ' s disease for 3 years developed painful erythematous nodular lesions predominantly on the UNK of her hands and feet , as well as on her elbows and wrists .    2.681749930322005
the clinical features and histopathological picture of leukocytoclastic vasculitis were both highly suggestive of erythema elevatum diutinum .    2.0706490464936245
no improvement of the skin lesions was observed during treatment with high doses of oral steroids .    3.2778955250644692
in contrast , treatment with dapsone resulted in a marked reduction of skin lesions .    2.605843093333831
during a new attack of her crohn ' s disease the erythema elevatum diutinum lesions UNK again .    2.3041285927351987
the parallel clinical course of erythema elevatum diutinum and crohn ' s disease , as well as the detection of immune complexes and neutrophilic granulocytes in lesions of both diseases , strongly suggest a common etiology .    2.507581493355534
this hypothesis is discussed in context with this case and the recent literature .    2.7207015194316373
the mammalian brain is capable of a substantial functional reorganization , UNK on a cortical UNK and on a behavioral level .    2.318206591054289
possible mechanisms are reviewed based on the work by others and UNK on somatosensory reorganization in humans .    2.6335931228202645
the somatosensory system is characterized by divergent projections from the periphery to the cerebral cortex .    2.387814874395465
changes in synaptic weights allow for reorganization of sensory processing : on one side , limb amputation will result in a representational " invasion " of the UNK cortex from neighboring regions with concomitant perceptual changes .    2.224815131191519
on the other side , sensorimotor training can increase the representational cortical zone of a limb .    2.107291450870445
plastic changes can be temporary or persistent .    2.5507279312233555
UNK factors like pain and certain drugs seem to induce a permissive state in the cortex resulting in enhanced reorganization .    2.1184644841525095
thus , specific physical training combined with UNK modulation holds promise to improve functional recovery after brain lesions .    2.131061096285952
there have been some prospective randomized studies which compared primary angioplasty with intravenous thrombolysis in patients with an acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) .    2.527308607582776
however , a substantial number of patients with ami who would not have been included in those trials are treated with one of these two therapeutic options .    2.768355245119761
to describe the proportions , characteristics , and outcome of these patients treated with primary angioplasty or thrombolysis we analyzed the data of the prospective " maximal individual optimized therapy for acute myocardial infarction " ( UNK ) trial .    2.8707947682819523
chronic infectious diseases may run over many months and years , accompanied by only mild clinical signs and often without organ - specific symptoms .    2.076479272387098
people with any kind of UNK deficiency are more frequently affected by chronic infections .    2.422583773614819
history , physical examination , laboratory tests , microbiological tests and imaging methods may lead to an exact diagnosis .    2.6093151121672222
the most important differential diagnosis are autoimmune diseases , amyloidosis and malignant lymphoma .    2.2986143433645667
background : we perform partial sphincterectomy during cataract surgery in cases with very small pupil ( < 3 mm ) .    2.321532735701764
we assume that the small pupil is mainly due to a fibrosis ring of the sphincter muscle .    2.4066532976294326
trauma scores in emergency medicine quantitatively UNK the severity of trauma victims ' injuries and physiologic derangements .    2.579956758529269
they are used to detect and assess patients and have applications in guiding patient care and early therapeutic decisions .    2.3121086971316416
in the pre - clinical setting , an effective trauma index meets the following criteria : - it is highly reliable with regard to identifying high - and low - risk patients .    2.404695237273303
- it has high face - validity .    2.3905116416916945
- it has high inter - and intra - rater reliability .    2.4571662968063768
- it is easy to use and allows rapid , accurate measurements .    2.531686378262246
the most widely accepted injury severity index is probably the injury severity score ( iss ) .    2.265787236535767
it is calculated as the sum of the UNK of the three most severely injured body regions , and was originally developed as a means to UNK the description of injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents .    2.8507007369391877
the trauma score ( ts ) represents the gold standard of physiologic scoring of injury severity .    2.324846065312038
it UNK the numerical assessments of the central nervous and cardiopulmonary system functions .    2.4637978681907216
the recently developed mainz emergency evaluation score ( mees ) is based upon numerical specification of the vital signs , including a pain scale , and has been designed as a dynamic score .    2.1700066983420747
nevertheless , limitations of the established trauma score systems have been described .    2.684888142109182
mortality and patient outcome do not strictly correlate with injury severity scoring .    2.2942323136021043
thus , therapeutic efficacy could hardly be assessed , and subsequent scoring during time periods was impossible .    2.013174947161819
the accurate definition of comprehensive evaluation of a trauma victim is challenging , for example , " pain " as chosen in the mees must be regarded as a highly desirable piece of information although its rating may prove difficult , especially when classifying unconscious patients .    2.066313860614912
further criticisms of the above - mentioned trauma indices could include omission of the trauma victim ' s age , gender , pre - injury health status , or the influence of alcohol or additional medication .    2.506906650431293
moreover , questioning the interrater reliability of injury severity scoring , a recent study revealed UNK in UNK values to trauma patients : trained UNK classified injury severity with significantly higher indices than less experienced researchers .    1.9682906355838812
if trauma indices in pre - hospital emergency medicine were relied upon as the only means of evaluating a trauma patient and guiding therapeutic approaches , significant numbers of trauma victims requiring major interventions would be missed .    2.0503719957931494
resuscitative treatment regimens must not be based solely upon indices , since , e . g . , in states of shock injury scores do not correlate with fluid resuscitative requirements .    2.1386556713156897
furthermore , a qualitative assignment of single vital - function parameters as crucial indices for a patient ' s condition never reflects the broad range of a patient ' s profile .    2.380172181097478
many multiple - trauma patients do benefit from controlled ventilation in clinical experience even though pulse oximetry values are within the physiological range , and the administration of analgesics or even pre - hospital anaesthesia has often proved advantageous for trauma patients in the field .    2.516466135079136
providing the opportunity of subsequent patient evaluation and the efficacy of acute care , the mees has been developed as a dynamic scoring system .    2.664057132542633
this design is extremely desirable and must be regarded as an UNK criterion for future scoring systems .    2.5593911401599247
in view of the peculiarities of field emergency medicine , pre - hospital indices do have limitations .    2.2296970553295754
the parameters " unknown patient " , time pressure , UNK measurements , lack of diagnostic facilities , incomplete evaluation , and limited statistical power cannot be eliminated .    2.0110519735657193
accurate prediction of outcome within early time - UNK is therefore not possible .    2.494539204408129
ossification of the achilles tendon is the result of a traumatic , hypoxic injury of the tendon .    3.22899253593488
the usually asymptomatic ossification has a clinical importance only in case of a new trauma .    2.9005530749701225
we report about a patient with an isolated fracture of the ossification without an accompanying rupture of the achilles tendon .    2.8789863145555517
because of the radiologically " occult " fracture the diagnosis could only be verified by mri .    2.363845123485061
with a conservative treatment without resection of the ossification we could reach painless recovery .    2.6072543607391987
hair problems are UNK at the levels of information supply , trichological competence and evidence based medical treatment .    2.3861648621355696
the UNK represent a major health care challenge , and the psychological significance of hair loss has only recently found appreciation in the medical community .    2.4954109420869317
they may pose a UNK problem for non - specialized physicians , who tend to UNK such complaints , although the patient ' s perception of abnormality determines whether or not advice is sought .    2.4441007257568446
perception of a hair problem is subject to UNK standards ; films and advertisements help determine the threshold for " UNK " and what is " healthy " and " UNK " , and the media provide an abundance of UNK information with respect to hair care .    2.5244855973453326
patients with hair problems frequently UNK the hairdresser prior to the medical specialist .    2.584684852536119
thus additional areas of competence should be incorporated into the hairdresser ' s training qualifications .    2.0477327780950794
besides manual , creative and psychological UNK , " trichological competence " relating to the recognition of most important hair disorders , recognition of personal limitations and cooperation with the medical specialist are required .    2.156044613335168
to optimize the interaction between the physician , UNK and the media , more effective communication and public activities from the medical profession are desirable , with success depending on full identification of the set goals , qualification and UNK to the standards determined by the medical speciality .    2.5386662258385706
we reexamined biopsy and resection specimens from seven patients with histologically established primary diagnosis of small - cell lung cancer ( sclc ) which showed previously undetected adenocarcinomatous differentiation after chemotherapy .    2.170562674316545
adenocarcinoma was diagnosed in the same part of the lung as was sclc before treatment in five cases and in contralateral location in two .    2.878789283851116
two tumors showed heterogeneous differentiation with small - cell and adenocarcinomatous components , and five had only adenocarcinoma .    2.2370128042154387
the interval between histological evidence of sclc and adenocarcinoma was 3 months - 5 years .    2.2794212561115352
from the specific findings in the respective patients we can offer two possible explanations for changing differentiation in sclc after chemotherapy : ( a ) a primarily UNK differentiated tumor with selection of adenocarcinomatous component under chemotherapy , and ( b ) an independently developed adenocarcinoma after successful chemotherapy of sclc , as patients with treated sclc are known to have an increased risk of non - sclc .    2.211522037191875
however , therapy - induced alteration of differentiation seems much more unlikely .    2.3661504778391502
these findings should be considered in diagnosis and therapy of sclc to allow early and appropriate reaction to non - sclc components .    2.5995857769815864
demonstration of bdv - specific serum antibodies , the isolation of bdv from cerebrospinal fluid of neuropsychiatric patients , and the recent demonstration of bdv antigen and bdv - rna in human brain tissue strongly suggest that bdv can infect humans .    2.1746403301432857
isolation of UNK virus from brain tissue is needed for final proof .    2.328224582133302
there is still great controversy about the question of whether bdv antigen , bdv - rna or bdv can be detected in peripheral blood monocytes or not .    2.2991702208252667
overall , the question of UNK of bdv infection for humans is wide open .    2.623756666679411
investigations of human cerebrospinal fluid indicate that bdv might cause human lymphocytic meningoencephalitis and so - called symptomatic psychoses in rare cases .    2.108141790062721
UNK studies suggest a widely non - specific but possibly pathogenic role of bdv in a spectrum of psychiatric disorders .    2.4567411284630616
in a controlled prospective study we compared the efficacy of combined salt water bath and uva / b phototherapy to a uva / b mono - phototherapy in patients with subacute atopic dermatitis ( ad ) .    2.3573605630068246
the patients in the balneophototherapy group ( n = 16 ) were treated with baths containing 3 - 5 % of the synthetic salt UNK - UNK , followed immediately by uva / b irradiation , while the other treatment arm ( n = 12 ) received uva / b phototherapy alone .    3.085982577428598
after 20 treatments the balneophototherapy group showed a statistically significant ( p < = 0 . UNK ) reduction of the scorad score from 69 . 5 before to 36 . 8 after therapy .    2.6917031980961297
no statistically significant reduction in the scorad score could be observed in the uva / b phototherapy group ( 50 . 6 before to 44 . 3 after therapy ) .    2.605616540491449
the cumulative uvb dose was significantly lower in the balneophototherapy group ( 0 . 9 j / cm2 ) as compared to the uva / b monotherapy group ( 2 . 0 j / cm2 ) .    2.8344600121933485
balneophototherapy was well tolerated by patients with atopic dermatitis and no side effects were observed .    2.555248977588066
we conclude that balneophototherapy expands the therapeutic options for patients with subacute atopic dermatitis .    2.6229745682038925
five percent of all human tumors are found in the head and neck region with an increasing rate .    2.739282523442341
head and neck tumors are not only a significant problem because of the large number of people affected .    3.5433975855215856
the functional and cosmetic disadvantages and UNK related to the therapy influence the medical recommendations for each individual patient .    2.5114221531632075
background and purpose : only a few clinical reports about the routine use of intravenous rt - pa for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke have been published .    2.656159023113373
wether the perfusion of the extracranial parts of the internal carotid artery influences the outcome of the patients is still unknown , because the two major studies about systemic thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa in stroke ( ecass and ninds ) did not UNK assess the status of the extracranial vessels .    2.751452245562885
introduction : chronic pain is an individually variable experience , incorporating physical , psychological and social dimensions .    2.1801573978362647
chronic pain occurs in a broad spectrum of severity ; therefore , a grading procedure is of crucial importance in clinical research and in epidemiologic studies .    2.496581930632441
it is mandatory to differentiate between traumatic and atraumatic instability when treating shoulder instability .    2.329718158224737
the traumatic instability is characterized by secondary lesions ( bankart lesion , hill - sachs lesion , UNK of the capsule ) , which are caused at the time of primary dislocation .    3.055802989592086
the quality of the capsule has to be considered in close relationship to the appearance of the bankart lesion .    3.1857648360487505
the stronger the capsule , the greater the external force has to be in order to UNK the resistance caused by the capsule .    3.2321844342821113
the damage to the glenoid rim makes it possible to draw conclusions about the condition of the capsule .    2.745024103603298
in cases of atraumatic instability , secondary lesions are normally absent .    2.3175850701669414
these instabilities are often caused by laxity of the capsule .    2.2780875694917206
when stabilizing , a shoulder two criteria have to be taken into consideration : stability and function .    2.497004617250522
reattachment of the labrum alone will not guarantee stability .    2.5937131775703635
additionally , the overstretched capsule has to be shortened or shifted .    2.572795859249024
both criteria are decisive for the success of the stabilizing operation .    2.7349314833288183
in benign UNK , thyroidectomy is only indicated in patients with nodular alterations of the complete thyroid gland .    2.7582724094414908
there is no evidence indicating that total thyroidectomy could improve the postoperative results in patients with graves ' disease .    2.6227451726368183
in germany , thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymph node dissection is the standard procedure for all differentiated thyroid carcinomas .    2.6562303466047754
however , there are no data to prove that this approach is superior to less radical procedures .    2.629141612290757
avoidance of reoperations and optimal conditions for effective postoperative UNK therapy are arguments for this aggressive strategy .    2.0846757782121
in patients with medullary carcinoma or with detected UNK - proto - oncogene mutations , thyroidectomy with cervicocentral lymphadenectomy should be the initial operation .    2.175715855812335
the UNK and mediastinal compartments should be dissected when clinically obvious lymph node metastases are present in patients with differentiated carcinomas .    2.767498269809954
in patients with medullary carcinomas , persistently increased calcitonin levels after the initial operation are sufficient indication for this procedure .    2.2801889974450313
thyroidectomy is an important part of the multimodal approach in patients with anaplastic carcinomas .    3.733522597177447
the operative technique of thyroidectomy is presented as well as the technique of cervical lymphadenectomy in consideration of the lymphatic drainage of the thyroid gland .    2.8971760112641047
UNK type i is an autosomal UNK inherited deficiency of UNK UNK resulting in accumulation of UNK and its degradation products ( UNK mainly ) .    2.7664863666746937
typical clinical features include liver and kidney failure as well as central nervous system involvement .    3.1472459120767957
there are three main forms of the disease : the acute form with manifestation in newborn infants and the subacute and the chronic form in children older than one year of age .    2.1640029394175593
experimental data and clinical as well as postmortem experiences have indicated that subdural hematomas are less frequent in acceleration injuries in traffic accidents compared to falls or assaults .    2.2867961565186907
the present report demonstrates that this does not hold true in the same way for bridging vein ruptures ( one of the predominant causes for subdural bleedings ) .    2.301608574613535
ruptures of these vessels without subdural bleeding ( sdb ) are only seldom mentioned in the literature .    2.0737524771937736
however , if no sdb is present , no one will look for these structures .    2.1934044952335148
in our institute a systematic analysis of the bridging veins in all cases of lethal blunt head injury is made : prior to the careful morphological preparation we investigate these vessels by radiographic imaging after filling with contrast medium .    2.1714557530227014
6 car passengers ( age between 4 and 31 years ) which suffered a lethal head injury were examined in the last year .    2.450799875583337
2 victims had UNK fractures with cerebral compression injuries .    2.3648938884342585
in 1 case the base of the skull was broken and in 3 cases no skull fracture was present ; no serious focal brain injury had occured in these 4 cases , but 3 victims had signs of diffuse brain injury .    2.213919511978154
in 5 cases a direct impact of the head against the interior of the car was obvious .    2.5381924534559897
in 5 cases ruptures of UNK bridging veins could be demonstrated .    2.2685039378887866
in one case ( survival for 3 days ) a minor sdb ( 20 ml ) was present and the ruptures had been closed by thrombosis ; another victim died at the scene .    2.11810557584947
the other 3 victims survived between 4 and 15 hours without developing sdb and without closing of the ruptures by thrombosis .    2.0280225252756225
this combination is surprising and shows that our knowledge concerning the relationship between bridging vein ruptures and sdb is UNK .    2.322716640049163
the frequency of bridging vein lesions in severe head injuries is likely underestimated in the clinical as well as in the postmortem literature .    2.7329951451955785
a rapid increase of intracranial pressure after the accident resulting in a collapse of the cerebral circulation is probably responsible for the absence of the sdb in the presented cases .    2.8008706710065843
implantable hearing aids can form the basis of new surgical techniques for dealing with hearing problems originating in the inner ear , provided they are fully implantable .    2.237869493612254
accordingly , a comprehensive , interdisciplinary , combined project was initiated at the ent clinic of the university of tübingen which was to conclude with operations to improve hearing via fully implantable hearing aids .    2.0424245794323794
a novel electromechanical transducer for implantable hearing aids based on the piezoelectric principle is described .    2.5994185707697905
unlike the piezoelectric transducers reported so far , this transducer does not rely on the UNK principle but on a circle - shaped , UNK combination system consisting of a UNK disc and metal membrane .    2.28645630539483
transfer of mechanical oscillations to an UNK in the middle ear is effected by a directly fixed coupling rod or via suitable coupling elements .    2.3608612719028543
the transducer is highly UNK with a resonance frequency at the upper end of the spectral transfer range ( greater than 10 khz ) .    2.5132094951858512
below this resonance and down to low frequencies , the frequency response of elongation is smooth with amplitudes of around 20 nm .    2.037764353967897
at low and middle frequencies of up to 1 khz , these vibration amplitudes correspond to sound - pressure levels of around 90 db spl .    2.131927227928643
at higher frequencies of up to 10 khz , the output level increases to about 130 db spl .    2.3792834827985376
nonlinear distortions are also very small at the highest levels ( less than 0 . 1 % ) throughout the whole transfer range .    2.438322135106003
electric power consumption at maximum levels is in the range of a few UNK and is therefore significantly lower than that of electromagnetic systems .    2.651214406226646
particularly , this makes it possible to use the transducer in fully implantable hearing aids for rehabilitation of sensorineural hearing loss .    2.386270499992723
in craniomaxillofacial traumatology , surgical oncology and craniomaxillofacial reconstruction , a surgeon ' s aim may interfere with the UNK visual pathway .    2.290263557195565
precise concepts and therapeutic strategies are mandatory to detect and deal with anterior visual pathway disorders .    2.4234622663684595
in order to develop these strategies , knowledge of the pathomechanisms of potential optic nerve trauma , primary radiological investigations , and further diagnostic measures are important .    2.3656364280026994
due to the difficulties in UNK testing of visual pathway functioning in severely injured patients or even during craniomaxillofacial reconstructions , we established flash - evoked visual potentials ( vep ) and the UNK ( erg ) as reliable electrophysiological methods to UNK specific information as to whether the visual pathway function is intact , even if pathological , but still present or absent .    2.1252889860292887
case reports show that subjectively or objectively confirmed unilateral amaurosis does not UNK mean irreversible vision loss .    2.0571614230346267
the electrophysiological evaluation together with multiplanar computer tomography ( ct ) are important for the immediate identification of optic nerve trauma .    2.4206761939956696
the results of this evaluation will provide the diagnostic information on whether surgical intervention and / or conservative therapy is required to prevent secondary optic nerve damage .    2.4029242006915
and 5 . 4 mg / kg bodyweight / h i . v .    2.9209432160068984
surgical therapy involves decompression of the orbital compartment in case of retrobulbar hematoma or decompression of the UNK part of the optic nerve in the traumatized optic canal or posterior orbit as confirmed by ct .    2.6887018894718344
prospective analysis of our trauma patients and the international literature on traumatic optic nerve lesions show that the time factor in when to start therapy has been greatly underestimated .    2.524822500485563
to fulfill modern treatment concepts in craniomaxillofacial surgery , sound diagnostic and therapeutic knowledge on the maintenance of visual pathway function is required .    2.3655113603175124
in the presence of preterm labor , premature rupture of the membranes , and preterm maturation of the cervix , there is an increased risk for premature birth .    2.952616961616328
there is a combination of endocrine as well as paracrine regulations which are responsible for the events associated with preterm labor , maturation of the cervix , and preterm rupture of the membranes .    2.815583293422083
apart from classical hormones , various pro - inflammatory cytokines act as mediators .    2.2287610337904193
at the fetal - maternal interface - which is formed by the placenta with the UNK on the fetal side and the UNK , myometrium , and the cervix on the maternal side - an intense interaction between endocrine and immunological reactions has been observed .    2.5959372613026956
melatonin ( n - acetyl - 5 - UNK ) is a hormone with multiple functions in humans , produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by - adrenergic receptors .    2.538672616871091
serum melatonin levels exhibit a circadian rhythm with low levels during the day , rise in the evening and maximum levels at night between 2 and 4 a . m . melatonin participates in the regulation of several physiological processes such as seasonal biological rhythm , daily sleep induction , aging and modulation of immunobiological defence reactions .    1.868864305215058
furthermore , melatonin has a highly lipophilic molecular structure facilitating penetration of cell membranes and serving as an extra - and intracellular free radical UNK .    1.9222965254763136
melatonin seems to UNK mainly UNK radicals , the most damaging of all free radicals .    2.3473316876582753
melatonin may play a role in the etiology and treatment of several dermatoses e . g .    3.063865515252449
atopic eczema , psoriasis and malignant melanoma .    2.528078734077124
the influence of melatonin on hair growth is another aspect .    2.433668215847424
topical application of melatonin inhibits the development of uv - erythema .    3.142419256018172
penetration through skin after topical application and oral bioavailability UNK further investigations on the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of melatonin .    1.9433128452446924
lung dust analyses were performed on tumor - free lung tissue from surgical samples of 28 carcinoid tumors .    2.3329749042321537
the measured levels in one surgical sample may easily be correlated with the increased asbestos load of the lung due to the patients ' occupation as stone mason .    2.6992184684071145
analysis of 147 repeat arthroscopies of the knee performed at the department of surgery at the herz - UNK UNK , fulda , from 1990 to 1995 , showed that meniscal lesions were the most common ( n = 89 , 60 . 5 % ) .    2.8884378151891164
the majority of meniscal lesions ( n = 45 , 50 . 6 % ) occurred in UNK that had already been partially resected .    2.8328468332876486
the most common localization was the posterior third of the medial meniscus in ipsilateral lesions .    2.633054116833463
conversely , contralateral meniscal injuries were only documented in 18 cases ( 20 . 2 % ) , while de - novo lesions occurred in 29 cases ( 29 . 2 % ) .    2.518397769919903
a coincidence of meniscal injury with first - or second - grade cartilage damage was documented in 35 patients ( 39 . 3 % ) , whereas 54 patients ( 60 . 7 % ) had normal intra - articular cartilage .    2.8776741606453498
cartilage damage was most frequent in patients who had previously undergone partial meniscectomy .    2.9324268437051475
the most common therapeutic consequences were partial meniscectomy and cartilage - UNK .    2.3444755186767767
concerning patients ' postoperative satisfaction and evaluation of the results by oak score , the majority of patients attained significant improvement in function ( 65 . 2 % ) and showed good or excellent outcome in the oak score ( 88 . 8 % ) .    2.88814426049265
patients without accompanying cartilage damage had better results in comparison to patients with cartilage damage in the affected area ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.355720637495848
in conclusion , in patients with positive meniscal signs and a history of previous meniscal surgery , repeat arthroscopy is generally and early indicated and can be recommended as a valid method to assess cartilage damage objectively .    2.447398975824793
however , patients with cartilage damage do not have the same benefit .    2.8055164869772335
the present study examined the effectiveness of combined dermatological and behavioural medicine therapy on the skin status and disease - specific stress of eighty - six patients with psoriasis and fifty - eight patients with atopic dermatitis who were hospitalized in the UNK clinic , UNK , germany .    2.7511046536254216
in addition to receiving instruction about their stain disease , the patients were offered , practice in relaxation techniques , social contacts and scratching control as well as individual psychological counselling .    2.3544345043214228
the clinical change was assessed by pasi and scorad , respectively .    2.3535367311647306
the marburg questionnaire for coping with skin diseases ( UNK ) and a questionnaire for health - related control attributes ( UNK - s ) served as psychometric measures .    2.7753656089654277
patients showed significant improvement in skin status and psychosocial parameters in pre - post comparison .    2.488237805864434
social fears , avoidance and helplessness were reduced by significant improvement of the emotional status in both groups .    2.3544670251057824
patients with psoriasis also showed an increase in internal control attributes .    2.8827135467319924
dermatological treatment combined with behavioural medicine therapy can be considered an effective method in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis .    3.0058461152254905
treatment of chronic cancer pain with strong opioids is indicated in about 60 - 70 % of patients .    2.881403989422834
surprisingly , these very potent analgesics are prescribed with great reservations in many countries , including germany .    2.0208697742687454
the aim of our investigation was to analyse the supply of opioid analgesics to outpatients with cancer pain in the region of hannover , which has about 1 . 1 million inhabitants .    2.5529212284632847
in germany special prescription forms , i . e . triplicate forms , have to be used for the prescription of strong opioids .    2.822595537298687
at the time when our investigation took place prescriptions for outpatients had to be renewed every 7 days .    2.315240301144087
for two observation periods of 6 months lasting from january to june 1988 and from january to june 1991 all of the opioid prescription forms that had been issued by general practitioners for clients of the aok hannover ( one of the major medical insurance companies ) were evaluated .    2.230461806381849
the reasons for prescribing opioids were analysed by recording the diagnosis .    2.4167384265273357
the individual treatment period on an outpatient basis during these 6 months was determined , excluding , e . g . days of hospitalization .    2.324052963520019
during the two observation periods only 16 . 2 % ( 1988 ) and 19 . 5 % ( 1991 ) of the practitioners in the region of hannover prescribed strong opioids to outpatients .    2.654171264245463
the majority of the practitioners consisted of general practitioners and specialists in internal medicine .    2.338292741755666
although these two groups mainly function as family doctors who are responsible for the basic therapeutical needs of their patients , only 22 . 6 - 33 . 8 % of these doctors prescribed opioids to outpatients .    2.3822510048361325
in two - thirds of the patients , cancer pain was the reason for prescribing the drug .    2.662901592299023
altogether UNK prescription forms in 1988 and UNK prescription forms in 1991 had been issued for these patients .    2.203692298110912
applied to the individual treatment period as an outpatient , only 36 . 0 % of the patients in 1988 and 32 . 1 % in 1991 received a regular prescription of strong opioids every 7 days .    2.832205013721235
the mean time interval between separate prescriptions was 16 . 8 + / - 25 . 4 days in 1988 and 19 . 4 + / - 29 . 1 days in 1991 .    2.830722685592892
accordingly , the majority of patients with chronic cancer pain had been supplied with opioids only occasionally .    2.779247376282319
our data indicate a significant undertreatment of outpatients suffering from cancer pain .    2.2747148230713674
taking into account the estimated total number of patients suffering from cancer , only 14 . 5 % ( 1988 ) and 19 . 0 % ( 1991 ) of all outpatients in need of strong opioids were supplied sufficiently with those analgesics .    2.6900514812949625
comparing the results from the observation period in 1988 with the results from 1991 it becomes obvious that the situation has not changed .    2.57855474521115
there are different reasons for the insufficiency of opioid treatment : many physicians as well as their patients are still UNK of the side effects of strong opioids .    3.2373620188297942
therefore , it is necessary to improve education concerning this issue .    2.6413648448896025
the legal restrictions on the use of narcotics and their complexity are another important reason for doctors not to prescribe strong opioids .    2.1827039819828458
in 1993 the regulations were simplified ; nevertheless , this has not led to a profound change in the attitude of the prescribing practitioners .    2.5056838404660993
thus , further changes in legislation seem to be necessary so that the requirements for the prescription of strong opioids do not differ from other drugs .    2.4234398718418757
the long - term functional results of acetabular fractures are assessed in terms of the corresponding criteria of merle - d ' aubigné and UNK ( pain , mobility , walking ) .    2.7093005357916886
other essential criteria include the quality of reduction and the radiological appearance .    2.894430539258198
a 53 year old female patient developed a keratoacanthoma , present on the left side of her nose for two months .    2.600235710178858
after repeated unsuccessful trials with cryotherapy , she was treated with intralesional injection of methotrexate performed twice with a weekly internal .    2.128209305808307
this led to complete resolution within 5 weeks .    2.4967833624211457
although controlled studies on the effect of methotrexate in keratoacanthoma are not available , the rapid regression and the good cosmetic result suggest that this therapy may play a beneficial role in treating these lesions especially in problem locations .    2.32104370996015
between january 1995 and june 1996 , 24 inpatients at our hospital ( mean age 55 . 6 years ) were treated with electroconvulsive therapy ( ect ) .    2.5177255898923123
clinical improvement was observed in 80 % of the patients , including those without risk factors ( nrg , n = 16 ) , as well as those with concomitant cardiovascular diseases ( rg , n = 8 ) .    3.136577401776267
during a mean period of observation of 224 days after the end of ect 7 patients ( 35 % ) relapsed .    2.7835212512908307
the rate of relapse was higher in rg than in nrg patients ( 57 . 1 vs 23 . 1 % ) .    2.349501021781426
in all cases ect was well tolerated ; UNK applications of ect did not result in mortality or persistent morbidity .    2.2308954715731804
however , rg patients may be at increased risk for the development of minor cardiovascular complications , which were noted in three rg patients ( 37 . 5 % ) , but only in one patient ( 6 . 2 % ) in the nrg ( fisher ' s test , p = 0 . 09 ) .    3.235429572618918
taken together , our results demonstrate that ect is a safe treatment regimen for depression even in medically ill patients of old age .    2.337217031748453
on 21 . 11 . UNK the UNK UNK von kleist and his UNK UNK vogel were found dead in a small UNK by the UNK .    2.726089881143561
the autopsy revealed that kleist was shot in the mouth and vogel died from a close - contact shot to the chest .    1.9515477878338485
the UNK , which was reflected in letters and documents ended in a suicide pact .    2.6623263561706585
the conclusions of the pathologists were influenced by current medical opinions which were based on interpretations of the ancient humoral doctrine of UNK .    1.9218119387542598
subjective and objective opinions were mixed together .    2.5253299423241433
some forensic and historical aspects of this suicide pact are highlighted .    2.334843058384401
due to this fact , valuable time is often UNK by connecting or transferring emergency calls from one dispatching center to another .    2.0399021117967937
the purpose of this study was to analyse all calls received by the different dispatching centers in the city and county area of mainz with respect to total number , fraction of emergency calls , and specificity .    2.260930726677485
further , the total number of calls potentially referring to a hypothetic single dispatching center with a general emergency phone number ( 112 ) was calculated .    2.1211791164784817
during a 4 - month period , all telephone calls were registered and related to day , time , and origin of the call ( city or county ) and classified as non - urgent or emergency calls , calls appropriate to the dispatching center UNK , emergency calls to be transferred , or unspecific calls .    2.123912286920813
the ems dispatching center received 31 UNK calls , the five gps - centers 15 256 calls ; UNK emergency calls that were directed to the police or fb needed transfer to the ems .    1.9207177315821187
during UNK the ems and fb received the most calls , with a reduced frequency on saturdays and sundays ( table 2 ) .    2.1472760251064256
nevertheless , the highest total numbers of calls were received on saturdays due to multiple calls directed to the gps .    2.152539993954508
the fb had the highest specificity of calls ; more than 50 % of the calls to the gps were unspecific ( fig .    2.3906384731654544
of all calls , 4 . 37 % were classified as emergency calls ; two - thirds of these came from the area of mainz during the daytime .    2.388548069563797
during off - duty hours of the gps in the city , 51 % of the emergency calls reached the ems directly ; 49 % had to be connected by the police or fb .    2.4835510891630372
during duty hours of the gps centers in the county area , only 14 % of the urgent emergency calls reached the ems UNK directly ( fig .    2.2414687480573487
the ems area of mainz , with a total of 13 different telephone numbers for 7 dispatching centers , can be regarded as typical of the german situation .    3.065769127307654
the high number of emergency calls to be transferred ( up to 86 % under special circumstances ) demonstrated that this weak point in the german ems system must be eliminated by introducing a single emergency number .    2.158774109539724
this should occur when a europe - wide three - digit number " 112 " will be instituted , probably in 1995 .    1.894470787603366
additionally , the continued existence of 5 - or 10 - digit telephone numbers for non - urgent calls may be useful for allowing non - verbal differentiation of calls .    2.292657939507978
in any case , all telephone numbers , including the latter calls , have to enter one dispatching center .    2.5736175412774465
the main advantage of a single dispatching center would be avoidance of the time - consuming transfer of emergency calls from one dispatching center to the other .    2.340960957052201
in addition to elevated intraocular pressure , a compromised ocular blood supply has been implicated in the pathogenesis of primary open - angle glaucoma ( UNK ) .    2.220079433795816
the ongoing change of demographic and economic structures does not UNK employment ( as many believe ) , but this change indeed induces problems with the mandatory old - age security system in germany .    2.1076228352793396
this paper discusses some popular reform proposals and UNK with another proposal which takes into account economic incentives .    2.0164982363069326
especially the UNK aim of a longer lifetime employment is UNK .    2.330801575929771
epidemiologic data suggest that an underlying genetic disposition can be detected in up to 10 % of all colorectal cancer patients and autosomal dominantly inherited hereditary non - polyposis colorectal cancer ( hnpcc ) is the entity most frequently identified .    2.4639613412179804
it was described first by a . warthin in UNK in " family g " and is characterized by a predisposition to an early onset of colorectal cancer and other intestinal or genitourinary tumors .    2.2402461759719485
we report the case of a 61 - year - old woman with five different cancers .    2.4412320830847123
although the strict amsterdam criteria were not fulfilled , molecular analysis revealed hnpcc ; further genetic testing in the family confirmed that the 36 - year - old and so far healthy son had inherited the germline mutation of his affected mother .    1.9857568486301418
genetic testing in clinically suspected hnpcc cases is recommended for patients with colorectal cancer meeting the amsterdam criteria .    2.6769310600546734
in patients meeting one of UNK criteria 2 - 7 without meeting the amsterdam criteria , germline mutation analysis is recommended only in UNK - positive tumors .    2.182540285055817
introduction : the UNK - UNK stent features 2 newly designed " bridging segments " for enhanced longitudinal flexibility , in order to allow easier and safer stent implantation .    2.360190869920939
the median palatine suture has long been regarded as having the greatest resistance to dilatation of the maxilla .    2.1373261589194623
in 1984 glassman [ 3 ] presented a conservative - surgical method of division of the UNK suture in which only the lateral and anterior support of the maxilla is debilitated surgically .    2.4778915279602582
an orthodontic apparatus cemented in place preoperatively is already used intraoperatively for dilatation of the maxilla .    2.108243932023299
in the period from 1991 to 1997 , 16 patients with a UNK and various UNK findings have been operated on at our clinic by the method described by glassman [ 3 ] .    3.146024746529101
sometimes the maxilla was dilated intraoperatively using the apparatus cemented in place by the method of UNK and dilatation was continued postoperatively until the described result was achieved .    2.3435362546708784
after successful dilatation of the maxilla and a stabilizing phase , a mono - or bimaxillary operation was performed .    2.328447296296638
the use of this method led to the desired result in 15 patients .    3.08830310348061
dilatation of the maxilla was UNK by determining the pre - and postoperative width of the anterior and posterior dental arch using models and x - ray of the occlusal overlay of the maxilla .    2.7089387967816325
in one patient who was operated on at the age of 38 years , a fracture of the alveolar process of the maxilla occurred unilaterally due to the completed ossification of the median palatine suture .    3.122088078531156
the method of surgically aided dilatation of the maxilla at the level of le fort i plane is suitable for patients up to the age of 30 .    2.9046502702388777
in older patients , the median palatine suture should be UNK as well .    3.561730308346316
osteoarthritis is the most common joint disease .    3.55513091950947
in addition to known risk factors e . g .    2.3578020740127372
genetics , age and hormonal status it has been suggested that chronic - repetitive micro - and substantial ( macro - ) injury may play an important pathogenetic role .    2.21581436982399
in a longitudinal case - study we examined UNK - players for clinical and radiological changes of the finger joints over the course of 16 years .    2.5899219861630676
arteriovenous fistula is a rare complication following vascular trauma .    2.9936060882207784
we report a case of an arteriovenous fistula of the neck after a penetrating injury .    2.516121829513918
the only presenting symptoms were a UNK and a UNK murmur .    2.976063729382211
there were no signs of cardiac insufficiency .    2.6621248320177027
duplex scan and arteriography detected an arteriovenous fistula between the superior thyroid artery and the superior thyroid vein .    2.4100990343401523
treatment should be carried out as soon as possible , and is then usually simple and successful .    2.906872276754946
pathogenesis : arteriosclerosis and UNK ' s disease mediasclerosis are vascular diseases associated with calcification of the artery wall .    2.5160379751386297
while mediasclerosis in most cases develops in type 2 diabetic patients , arteriosclerosis is the result of a combination of different vascular risk factors .    2.6686881703756713
UNK ' s mediasclerosis typically involves the tunica media , whereas arteriosclerosis - associated calcifications primarily involve the intima .    2.072456861452749
the new technique of non - invasive magnetic resonance ( mr ) sialography was evaluated for normal and various pathologic conditions of the parotid gland .    2.5900205839335606
diseases included pleomorphic adenoma , UNK , carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma , ductal carcinoma , adenoid cystic carcinoma , UNK carcinoma , non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma , UNK , UNK , UNK ' s syndrome and congenital duct UNK .    2.774787583934433
in addition to the usually performed t1 and t2 cross - sectional sequences a heavily weighted t2 sequence ( tr 3600 , te 800 ) was performed and allowed depiction of a fluid - filled parotid duct .    1.9272777808225936
results showed that the main parotid and primary branching ducts were depicted reliably in all normal cases and all patients , except one with sicca syndrome .    2.3211502863992823
pathological conditions such as duct dilatations , duct strictures , obstructing duct UNK and irregular shapes and courses of the ductal system were demonstrable .    1.910297196330768
while x - ray sialography obtained a higher resolution , only mr sialography was able to depict dilated ducts proximal from a complete obstruction , as well as all ductal cysts .    2.3444587411574935
our findings show that mr sialography can be applied successfully to investigations of the parotid gland system .    2.4353434712584234
there have been no contraindications or complications to date because mr sialography is non - invasive .    2.32457280127603
the technique will also allow the salivary ducts and lesions to be differentiated from the course of the facial nerve .    2.5029118976970546
substantial improvement in conformal radiotherapy is possible using modulated irradiation fields .    2.23145692150137
such modulated fields may be generated even with conventional accelerators by means of individual metal UNK or with the recently available dynamic UNK UNK ( UNK ) .    2.259659198934143
at the german cancer research center ( UNK UNK ) such a program has been developed under the name of " UNK " ( conformal radiotherapy ) .    2.5302015893762264
although it is an independent application , it is proposed for clinical usage to supplement a planning system that is already present .    2.509405222222581
so - called inverse planning differs from conventional 3 d planning , as the trial - and - error approach for finding good field parameters is nearly completely avoided .    2.1803159884866985
instead , the radio - oncologist is given the chance directly to UNK medically oriented criteria like the prescription dose in the target volume , maximal tolerance dose values for each organ at risk and their weighting factors .    2.0040030408402414
in addition , the so - called UNK optimization allows aimed , partial overdosage , especially in UNK structured organs in order to obtain better overall planning results .    2.383987589115576
the problem six - year old boy with unilateral type - ii UNK , UNK and UNK of the 2nd toe .    3.5700905070179343
the marked UNK of the forefoot not only causes painful pressure points but also problems with fitting of shoes .    2.471117394624378
a child with typical signs of the cat eye - syndrom except the characteristic feature of a cat eye is reported .    2.09761633619237
in a chromosome analysis ( 47 , UNK , + mar de novo ) an extrachromosome was detected .    2.3689259296471867
using fluorescence in situ hybridization the supernumerary marker UNK to chromosome 22 .    2.2088076910157826
in the literature only a few cases show all the characteristic features of cat eye syndrome .    2.7331496124107355
however , there are only two case reports of children without any ocular alterations .    2.611133909406168
the great variability in the phenotype probably depends on different sizes of the marker chromosome or asymmetric UNK on the long arm of chromosome 22 .    2.2738612938372316
according to new literature reports there is no correlation between the phenotypic variability and the size of the marker chromosome .    2.708868319902639
probably the degree of severity is correlated with the percentage of the patients lymphocytes that contain the extrachromosome .    3.156599247275473
introduction : children with all frequently present with skeletal pain at the time of diagnosis .    2.357512206616786
we retrospectively analyzed the incidence and clinical features of skeletal pain and the correlation between pain and radiographic findings .    2.6789011510142067
objective : elevated levels of interleukin - 1 ( il - 1 ) and interleukin - 6 ( il - 6 ) have been reported after cardiac operation , during inflammatory process and cardiac allograft rejection .    2.893135169299513
although several groups proved the evidence of a negative inotropic effect , the actual mechanism is not completely understood .    2.3762057203376306
speaking generally it is possible that low molecular weight proteins are capable of altering myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus .    2.2577133486288368
therefore this study analyzes whether il - 1 and / or il - 6 influence myocardial contractility on the level of the contractile apparatus .    2.686187154440695
methods : during aorto - coronary bypass operation , human muscle fibers were excised ( n = 32 ) and skinned using UNK - x - 100 .    2.199782265361071
the experimental skinned fiber model excludes membrane - related factors such as receptor activation and provides direct examination of the contractile apparatus itself .    2.266486139246553
different concentrations of il - 1 and il - 6 were applied ( pil - 1 / il - 6 1 - UNK - 5 - 10 - UNK ) .    3.0576846110506506
force generation , calcium sensitivity , and velocity of force generation and relaxation were measured .    2.198209857678756
( experiments were carried out at optimal length , bath temperature 23 °c , and UNK conditions . )    2.671982041555709
results : none of the skinned muscle preparations of the human myocardium showed under the given experimental UNK a significant change in contractility and relaxation after exposure to il - 1 and il - 6 .    2.2862176239267784
despite using UNK concentrations of il - 1 and il - 6 ( pil - 1 / il - 6 10 - UNK ) no significant effect occurred .    2.6930218781278783
furthermore no difference in calcium - sensitivity of the contractile proteins following addition of il - 1 and il - 6 could be observed .    2.6912516737594383
conclusions : thus , there is no experimental evidence for direct modulation of the contractile apparatus by il - 1 or il - 6 .    2.7447497563523737
given these results it is possible to exclude some potentially negative inotropic UNK that are mediated on the level of the contractile apparatus as the molecular mechanism .    2.3850408117320856
these data show that therapies which support myocardial contractility during sepsis by stimulation of the contractile proteins do not seem to be very promising .    2.5129299962882734
indications for UNK and radiocarpal UNK and UNK are osteoarthritis , kiehnböck ' s disease , rheumatoid arthritis and several posttraumatic disorders of the wrist joint .    3.0344225891184906
the resection of carpal bones leads to severe instability patterns of the wrist .    2.4040447966280096
in conclusion we recommend resection - arthroplasty just for treatment of the thumb UNK - metacarpal osteoarthritis .    2.4078064237528487
implant resection arthroplasty of the lunate and scaphoid or total wrist implants are still causing multiple problems regarding heavy load .    2.0564908497342995
therefore this implants should be confined to rheumatoid patients .    2.438279568779361
of the limited carpal arthrodeses the UNK - UNK arthrodeses is the most frequent performed procedure .    3.134927669217565
it can be indicated for UNK - osteoarthritis , kiehnböck ' s disease , UNK - lunate instability and scaphoid pseudarthrosis if other surgical procedures had failed presuming there are no signs of arthrosis in the radiocarpal joint .    2.430893673750217
persisting pain especially in heavy work is quite frequent after limited arthrodesis but can be greatly UNK by simultaneous wrist denervation .    1.9770996785565078
in advanced cases of osteoarthritis total wrist arthrodesis is still the best choice for the patient .    2.572184091949109
increasing numbers of UNK at the anaesthesiologist ' s UNK , providing more than 20 different parameters of the patient ' s condition , have already made it impossible to record all the values in a handwritten form .    2.575354517401844
consequently , this most common method of record - keeping must be incomplete and inaccurate .    2.0720073963564465
in recent years UNK data - acquisition systems have been introduced into clinical practice in order to produce more reliable records .    2.735619676260402
but after a 7 - year experience in the use of such a system in cardiac anaesthesia , we have recognised certain problems that remain to be solved before automated record - keeping will achieve wider acceptance .    2.428461273001546
the second major problem is the appearance of artifacts , caused mainly by mechanical manipulations during the operation .    2.459471226651498
in this paper , 300 courses of anaesthesia that were recorded on - line during different cardiac surgery procedures were examined and the incidence as well as the kind of artifacts occurring were evaluated .    2.317261163877094
algorithms were developed for each haemodynamic parameter to suppress these artifacts automatically by a subsequent analysing process ; the efficiency of that " artifact filter " was validated in 35 of the 300 cases .    1.9334892045196557
based on more than 30 , 000 values for each parameter , the incidence of artifacts was 3 % - 7 % .    2.5947043988399603
however , only 0 . 1 % - 0 . 5 % of the artifacts could not be eliminated by the filter .    3.66031259243361
the method described here provided acceptable UNK UNK of the most important haemodynamic parameters ( figs .    3.1781679030955137
1b and 2b ) and would also be suitable to serve as an input filter for automatically running anaesthesia data - examination processes , which are currently being developed in our clinic .    2.2941968989135826
extracorporal shock wave application ( eswa ) has been used in the treatment of stones located in kidneys , bile , pancreas and the glandula parotis .    2.2358781078512995
in the last 2 years several studies have shown the benefit of the eswa on the treatment of soft tissue disorders .    3.0674772341903442
the aim of this study was to explore the effect of high energy extracorporal shock waves in patients with painful calcaneus spurs .    2.5140857316988066
83 patients who underwent UNK treatment without benefit were treated with 3000 impulses of 0 , 30 mj / mm2 .    2.5320060134697653
follow - ups after 12 weeks and 12 months showed that 51 of 83 patients became pain - free and 20 patients improved from the treatment .    2.403410871885638
the results are showing the benefit of the high energy extracorporal shock wave application in the treatment of chronic plantar UNK .    2.9499771800170436
in developed countries , medical conditions , rather than lack of food , are the main UNK to malnutrition .    2.3616546929269235
undernutrition is especially common in older persons , occuring in 5 - 12 % of community - dwelling older persons , in 30 - 61 % of hospitalized older persons , and in 40 - 85 % of persons in long - term care institutions .    2.5809549018591302
the multi - factorial nature of undernutrition in the elderly forces a structured differential diagnostic approach to determine underlying causes .    2.274557080594339
heightened physician awareness of nutritional problems and prompt risk assessment is imperative to prevent the UNK of undernutrition .    2.7178865378136496
this structured approach to the differential diagnosis is essential to evaluate potentially reversible causes of malnutrition .    2.857534088488233
the number of surgical procedures performed as day surgery has significantly increased in recent years .    2.560960446730515
therefore , a safe and short postoperative recovery period has become increasingly important .    2.3679967982255263
the aim of the present study was to investigate perioperative cognitive and physiological function after oral premedication with low - dose midazolam ( 3 . 75 mg ) , especially during the postoperative period .    2.4127316215411803
heart failure may be defined as a reduced physical per - UNK frequently caused by a defect in myocardial contraction .    2.626401605865381
predominantly underlying causes are coronary artery disease , hypertension , cardiomyopathies and valvular heart diseases .    2.377366626067507
psychic disorders were studied with a naturalistic design in 125 consecutive patients of a medical - geriatric department in a general hospital .    2.2579754662759055
based on the clinical examination and the values of the mini - mental - state - examination ( 2 ) , 51 patients were classified as unable for diagnostic procedures concerning psychic state .    2.704094950787395
the other 74 patients underwent these diagnostic procedures including clinical investigation and three screening - scales ( geriatric depression scale ( 11 ) ; hospital anxiety and depression - scale ( 4 ) .    2.023548467825679
if these examinations led to the suspicion that a patient suffered from a psychic disorder , an interview was performed by a psychotherapist with experience in UNK treatment and information was collected from the medical and nursing staff .    2.6005382558162866
dementia was detected or excluded by neuropsychological tests .    2.3087927747750943
psychic disorders were found in 41 patients , mostly adaptation disorders and depressions , the disorder was estimated to be relevant for the whole hospital therapy .    2.442527429432502
the screening instruments turned out to be reliable , so they can be recommended for further use .    2.6068017718860745
difficult to answer remains the question , how the treatment of the psychic disorders - in our sample necessary for each 5th to 6th patient - can be implemented in a medical - geriatric department .    2.385567682222251
based on the " trauma registry " of the german society of trauma surgery , an UNK quality management ( qm ) system was implemented .    2.552792293030904
the principles of the qm system as well as the differences in the quality of outcome and treatment are presented .    3.2690029352553642
the analysis uses the data on 2 , UNK severely injured ( iss = 22 + / - 14 ) patients from 20 hospitals collected prospectively and anonymously between 2 / 93 and 12 / 97 .    2.176801475966727
outcome quality was analyzed by the triss method and z - statistics .    2.4684920632865794
the z - value of the whole series was - 0 . 24 .    3.361742318845281
there were three hospitals with more than 150 patients that had a ps value calculated by the triss method .    2.2893954083021617
clinic a had a good ( - 2 . 49 ) , clinic b an average ( - 0 . 3 ) and clinic c ( 3 . 62 ) an adverse z - value .    2.7027708060445157
the assessment of treatment quality was performed by criteria concerning both preclinical and acute clinical phases .    2.485125516874872
clinic c had a prolonged preclinical treatment time ( 90 min vs 62 min in clinic a ) for severely injured ( iss > 15 ) patients .    2.0884182943412406
at the same time , the preclinical intubation rate for severe thoracic trauma ( ais > 3 ) was lower ( 44 % ) in clinic c than in a ( 62 % ) .    2.329552401236508
with 14 min clinic a had the shortest time until basic radiological and ultrasound diagnostics were completed ( x - rays of chest and pelvis and abdominal ultrasound ) in cases of severe blunt trauma ( iss > 15 ) , compared to 54 min in clinic b or 31 min in clinic c . also , cranial computed tomography for severe traumatic brain injury ( gcs < 9 ) was applied significantly faster in clinic a ( after 36 min ) than in clinic c ( after 62 min ) .    2.0424657855218546
delayed diagnoses were defined as the difference between the iss at discharge and the iss at completion of diagnostics in the emergency department ; this criterion was met best by clinic a with an iss difference of two patients compared to five in clinic b and four in clinic c .    2.2574332803031183
for invasive catheter procedures both ionic and nonionic contrast media ( cm ) with excellent tolerability are available .    1.9274215122476213
the governing practical factors for cm are x - ray opacity and biocompatibility .    2.4593520567584584
tolerability of a contrast medium is governed among its physical properties by its viscosity , osmolality , and ionic concentration .    2.080808347274839
in germany the nonionic cm are currently preferred .    2.3095620923159923
because of its low thrombotic complications , the ionic cm UNK is an important alternative in high risk interventions .    2.639592570970141
in patients with known cm incompatibility , the prophylactic application of h1 - receptor antagonists and corticosteroids allows catheterization safely without complications .    2.1412836029760984
in impaired renal function , hydration is the most effective prophylactic measure to be taken .    2.7639839281626433
background : in the present study we evaluated the influence of topical UNK on intraocular pressure and the blood - aqueous barrier after uncomplicated phacoemulsification and pc - iol implantation .    2.363050026190567
a judgement on the patient ' s quality of life cannot be based solely on the information about the clinical severity of a disease .    2.855371910248462
very often there is no correlation between these parameters .    3.170591109259662
it is necessary to assess the quality of life by a health status question - UNK since non - life threatening diseases common in dermatology influence the quality of life very much .    2.5430303784003607
the most frequently used questionnaires are the sf - 36 and the UNK health profile .    2.7542947781561824
however , these forms do not evaluate all dermatologic patients adequately .    2.0765989198857464
therefore specific tools such as the UNK ( dermatology life quality index ) and UNK have been established for dermatology .    3.3686226255197864
further disease - specific questionnaires have been created to UNK - sure time related changes in dermatological patients .    2.36186994882646
we surgically treated twenty patients with axillary hyperhidrosis by UNK using UNK regional anesthesia .    2.1748307884438827
after a description of the surgical technique results are presented .    3.3742199085953053
except for trivial hematomas , no complications were seen .    2.597995566689689
every patient noted a significant reduction of sweat gland activity in the follow up period .    2.6739530963004827
long - term results remain to be seen .    3.0292291214001903
the value of cytogenetics performed simultaneously with histopathology was evaluated in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome ( mds ) .    2.7883342381045044
clonal karyotype changes of the bone marrow cells supporting the histological diagnosis were found in 38 / 69 cases ( 55 % ) .    2.860964962107467
the chromosome aberrations , especially complex changes , were significantly correlated to distinct histopathological findings such as UNK of the haematopoietic cell lines and UNK .    2.4543063757212478
complex karyotype changes were further associated with short survival of the mds patients .    2.256833350866618
our results demonstrate that cytogenetic analyses are helpful in UNK the histopathological diagnoses .    2.609547671268955
recent developments in molecular cytogenetics even allow the detection of chromosomal aberrations in non - dividing cells from cytological preparations or tissue sections which may become available for routine diagnosis .    2.192823874229641
in the course of 1 year , clostridium difficile - associated diarrhea , which may lead to pseudomembranous colitis and therefore may be very harmful in frail elderly people , was diagnosed in six patients of a geriatric clinic .    2.4399443298259462
the disease is associated with antibiotic therapy , due to an overgrowth of the intestinal flora with clostridium difficile .    3.065606794864349
symptoms varied from a state of asymptomatic UNK or benign diarrhea to acute stages of the disease with severe diarrhea , abdominal pain , fever and acute phase response .    2.1897943441153145
diagnosis of clostridium difficile associated diarrhea was established when , in addition to typical clinical symptoms , a toxin - positive stool specimen was found .    2.3019637176257888
oral vancomycin was effective in all cases , leading to a stop in the diarrhea and an amelioration of systemic inflammatory parameters .    2.4442384206285555
according to recent results , in order to prevent the induction of vancomycin - resistance and in view of higher treatment costs , metronidazole is considered as the drug of choice in mildly and moderately ill patients .    2.4780167332977885
this report analyzes 46 cases of personnel - to - patient transmissions of hepatitis b ( hb ) , hepatitis c ( hc ) and hiv in health care settings .    2.2932615017470366
similar circumstances were found for transmission of hb ( 40 cases , 404 infected patients ) , hc ( 4 cases , 224 infected patients ) and hiv ( 2 cases , 7 infected patients ) .    2.2509155913399272
cases with the highest number of transmissions ( one anesthesiologist with 217 hc transmissions , and one eeg UNK with 75 hb transmissions ) were attributed to poor infection control practices .    1.9768515583442992
as long as infected health care workers ( hcw ) adhere to general infection control measures , a risk for transmission to patients exists only from infected surgeons who perform ' UNK - prone invasive procedures ' .    1.8920729155637162
whether changes in UNK of infected hcw are necessary should be decided on an individual basis .    2.386667536196901
often , the infected personnel were assumed to have acquired the disease occupationally .    2.2498348792354204
medical practices and devices bearing a risk of infection should constantly be reviewed with regard to risk for patients and personnel .    2.6339971683794796
the healthy newborn infant also has the right to optimal monitoring in order to detect any disturbance in postnatal adaptation as early as possible .    2.2863068052800166
the introduction of painless , simple , and yet reliable methods , e . g . , pulse oximetry and transcutaneous bilirubin screening , has considerably improved the situation for obstetricians and midwives .    2.028876076768842
injuries of the spine in children rarely occur .    3.071546652336221
they amount to about 0 . 2 % of all fractures and dislocation and to 1 . 5 to 3 % of all lesions of the spine .    4.069613757642017
this spinal segment in comparison to adults is concerned more often and accounts for 50 % of all c - spine injuries .    2.689959837622813
important differences between the adult spine and the spine in the child disappear with the age of 10 years .    2.9454590777815834
later diagnostics , classification and treatment correspond widely with the principles valid in adults .    2.170432877821203
the knowledge of the normal shape and development of the spine are crucial in avoiding UNK of x - ray films .    3.093571721597964
typical examples include the confusion of synchondrosis with fractures or of UNK of the atlas and the c2 / c3 segment with " true " instabilities .    2.3017202621162522
relevant lesions always are accompanied by clear clinical symptoms .    2.3281463914394878
specific injuries of the growing axial skeleton are lesions of the cartilaginous endplates and " fractures " of the synchondrosis .    2.59723846977241
although a variety of histologic entities were described , primary tumors of the trachea are rare findings .    2.7412731999433673
over a period of 20 years , 30 patients underwent 31 tracheal resections in two hospitals for thoracic surgery .    2.177712543374576
among them 4 patients had thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea .    2.256483543852714
in these patients a UNK combined with tracheal resection was performed .    2.609925958052718
all patients showed excellent long - term survival .    3.0037992617072984
principles , methods and results of percutaneous therapy in acute and chronic vascular alterations of the subclavian artery and its branches .    2.723039387191686
UNK concerning a possible association between temporomandibular disorders ( tmds ) and ear symptoms of otalgia and tinnitus have been made in the dental and medical literature for a long time .    2.133373749202108
current understanding of this association is reviewed .    2.5017939017411703
an analysis of relevant studies published between 1947 and 1996 shows that a relatively high percentage of tmd patients reported the presence of ear pain and noise .    2.3215830449248456
however , a cause - effect relationship has not been established to date .    2.699187708988952
it has to be taken into consideration that due to their high prevalence , tmds and ear symptoms in a given patient may be present by chance alone .    2.5500511395742675
a methodological weakness of most of the studies available is the fact that control groups were not considered .    2.8552896027274217
owing to the lack of prospective , controlled , and randomized studies , statements regarding the effectiveness of certain dental measures for the treatment of otalgia and tinnitus in tmd patients are not well supported .    2.524519809057323
our report describes a 46 - year - old woman with self - inflicted oedema of the left leg and the left arm .    2.9376653662603083
she induced leg oedema by an elastic bandage tourniquet and arm oedema by holding her arm dependent and UNK .    1.8873067785383482
a preexisting disorder of the affected leg ( postthrombotic syndrome ) and of the affected arm ( UNK subsequent to surgical injury of the plexus brachialis ) delayed the diagnostic proceedings .    2.6726149791717377
our case report shows that : - confirmed presence of organic disease does not exclude limb oedema of self - inflicted origin .    2.147230752516238
- oedema resulting from a tourniquet and " hysterical oedema " can be developed by one and the same patient .    2.2927412065367765
- effective care of such patients is only possible if dermatologist and psychiatrist work together all the time ( UNK psychiatry ) .    2.0847842604006304
purpose : this study was conducted to control improvement in the high preoperative prevalence of tmj symptoms in patients treated by long - term orthodontic therapy for class ii malocclusion .    2.897504956085016
patients and methods : a total of 57 patients were examined at least 8 years after surgery , 37 having received orthodontic treatment and orthognathic surgery and 20 surgery but without orthodontic treatment .    2.414157922582031
UNK , disk and condylar symptoms were recorded according to the UNK - UNK scheme .    3.195143456677703
results : both groups showed a normal maximal UNK distance .    2.470819010714413
the deviation during the opening movement was mainly UNK in the group with orthodontic treatment and terminal in the other group .    2.7292845049351153
muscular pain UNK in the group without orthodontic treatment .    3.3857036983808326
clicking sounds of the tmj were registered in 70 % of both groups .    2.6969660757226914
occlusal interference and a higher UNK distance when speaking were found more often in patients without orthodontic treatment .    2.5268824117605044
preoperatively , clicking and crepitation sounds had been recorded in 60 % of both patients groups .    2.418673954659644
conclusion : in conclusion , a high postoperative prevalence of tmj dysfunction symptoms was found in patients with class ii malocclusion 8 - 10 years after orthognathic surgery with or without orthodontic treatment .    2.791987982945446
both groups often exhibited tmj clicking and crepitation sounds , whereas the patients that had not received orthodontic treatment had a higher prevalence of occlusal interference and muscular pain .    2.1395738576357175
the synthesis of ps 2 protein is induced through estrogen - dependent transcription of the ps 2 gene .    2.2138455601890774
the presence of the ps 2 protein in breast cancer is thought to be as valuable as receptor status , or even more so , in predicting the response to hormonal therapy .    2.308833007190643
furthermore , ps 2 appears to be a prognostic factor for primary breast cancer .    2.769658266390431
in 162 cases of primary breast cancer , ps 2 was tested by immunohistochemical procedures on formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded tissues .    2.237774896634956
the concentrations of ps 2 in tumor cytosol were determined using an immunoradiometric assay .    2.277600557061461
positive staining for ps 2 ( irs > = 2 ) was seen in 27 % of the tumors .    3.003416862577182
comparison of immunohistochemical and biochemical detection ( 26 % of tumors had ps 2 cytosol concentrations above the cut - off value of 26 ng / mg cell protein ) revealed an 81 % concordance rate ( r = 0 . 76 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.026796691582697
univariate analysis showed no significant correlation of immunohistochemical ps 2 detection and age or menopausal status of patients , tumor size , tumor grade or nodal status .    2.312884183912441
however , the immunohistochemical ps 2 status correlated significantly with the immunohistochemical detection of the estrogen ( er ; p < 0 . 001 ) and progesterone receptor status ( pr ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.1257333448574727
ps 2 - positive tumors were er - positive in 66 % of cases and pr - positive in 73 % ; 89 % of ps 2 - positive tumors were positive for er and / or pr .    2.557993127855871
the incidence of immunohistochemical ps 2 detection was 41 % in the group of steroid receptor positive carcinomas ( er - and / or pr - positive ) in contrast to 7 % in steroid receptor negative tumors ( er - and pr - negative ) .    2.5547352427438805
patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass grafting may develop acute myocardial infarction late after surgery .    2.5908834418540905
it is not exactly known in these patients whether acute infarction is predominantly caused by occlusion of bypass or native vessels .    2.3103251433404184
also , there is no systematic and prospective data available with respect to an invasive , revascularizing therapeutic approach .    2.7209652094909464
therefore , acute coronary angiograms were obtained in 21 consecutive patients with acute infarctions and remote bypass grafting to elucidate mechanisms causing myocardial infarction in these patients , and to assess results of catheter - based recanalization .    2.764253177400233
we report the clinical and laboratory results of a family where one boy and one girl presented with a clinical picture resembling the x - linked UNK known as bruton ' s disease .    2.6451409259096796
both children showed severe bacterial infections starting at the age of around 6 months , a lack of all immunoglobulin classes and absence of mature b - cells in the peripheral blood .    2.453132723024356
with respect to reports from the literature these results are yet another indicator for the existence of an autosomal - UNK disorder with the same clinical make - up as bruton ' s disease .    2.4764627437463678
a deletion on chromosome 14 leading to the disorder was identified .    2.6615187642672393
conservative treatment of genuine stress urinary incontinence in females gained more and more interest .    2.5038163018593407
the use of mini - devices is one of the newly developed therapeutical options however , its clinical relevance and longterm - results are still under debate .    2.4924536945704934
this review article gives a critical evaluation of the available urethral plugs and regulators and new developments as well according to the longterm - follow - up studies in the literature and own experience with those devices .    2.8771754662701006
the continence rates that can be obtained with the different plugs or regulators are dependent upon the degree of stress incontinence , ability to insert the plug and compliance of the patient .    2.4591352694002184
reported longterm results vary between 48 % and 100 % .    2.3935511205245072
the most frequent side effects are urinary infection , haematuria and / or handling problems with the devices .    2.6181557559429796
according to the published material it is impossible to give therapeutical standards for treatment of female stress urinary incontinence with urethral mini - devices .    2.254357127197083
although proper patient selection might give excellent longterm - results in patient continence rates .    2.1318117780347645
background : in contrast to the correction of simple myopia there is no widely accepted technique for the correction of myopic astigmatism .    2.7152744275508844
currently two techniques are available : the photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy ( park ) and the combination of arcuate UNK with standard prk ( prk - t ) .    2.2811392486336386
although there are randomized data for cabg vs . medical therapy and cabg vs . ptca in primary therapy of cad , there is few evidence on the appropriate therapy of recurrent angina after prior cabg .    2.0609348451028047
we analyzed data from UNK consecutive patients ( pts . )    3.015975352020872
presenting for recurrent angina after previous cabg who required either re - cabg ( n = 67 ) , ptca ( n = 768 ) or medical therapy alone ( medrx ) ( n = 430 ) at our institution during 1986 through 1996 .    2.34970420084512
outcome after index therapy is monitored during 45 + / - 34 months .    2.753314631718813
the 3 therapeutic groups were similar with respect to gender ( 84 % male ) , age at therapy ( 60 years ) , prevalence of diabetes ( 22 % ) , and time to first ischemic event after primary cabg ( 37 months ) .    2.418713999381859
actuarial survival was significantly higher in the ptca - group at 1 , 5 and 10 years after therapy of recurrent angina , despite the freedom from subsequent re - intervention was significantly lower ( 1 - year - survival 95 % [ 37 % ] vs . 95 % [ 3 ] medrx vs . 79 % [ 4 % ] re - cabg , 5 - year - survival 87 % [ 57 % ] vs 78 % [ 17 % ] medrx vs . 50 % [ 4 % ] re - cabg and 10 - year - survival 72 % [ 65 % ] vs . 63 % [ 31 % ] medrx vs . 50 % [ 15 % ] re - cabg resp . , p < 0 . 0001 , [ numbers in UNK represent corresponding values for incidence of re - intervention , p < 0 . 0001 ] ) .    2.2416972947368685
due to advances in surgical methods , such as miniplate and lag screw osteosynthesis , there is current discussion about the adequate therapy of condylar fractures .    2.571031716920501
regarding the insufficient outcome of conservative treatment confirmed by refined methods of functional diagnosis , there is a trend towards surgical therapy , at least in cases of condylar displacement out of the fossa .    2.759614941065295
this trend was also prompted when surgeons learned that the condyle determines local growth but does not serve as a growth center of the mandible .    2.1549947929414888
along with increased interest in temporomandibular function and surgical therapy of internal disorders , surgical therapy of traumatic soft tissue lesions was emphasized .    2.265419633783747
this consequently led to surgical restoration of intraarticular fractures .    2.302233895020374
conservative treatment will nonetheless be sufficient in cases of minor displacement due to a higher ability of remodeling , even more so in children .    2.591761859615583
a case of a 37 - year - old woman with symmetrical bilateral apocrine UNK at the lateral margins of the eyelids is presented .    2.6738421175677427
the symmetrical , simultaneous and bilateral appearance of the lesions , the lack of association with other abnormalities and the absence of the lesion in the family history make this case remarkable .    2.855276303067411
the situation of intensive care units ( icu ) in germany was analyzed by a national survey .    3.0181899080998575
questionnaires consisting of multiple - choice and short - answer questions were sent to icus of university UNK , hospitals with > 1000 beds , 500 - 1000 beds , and hospitals with < 500 beds separately with regard to the different disciplines ( anesthesia icus , surgical icus , cardiac surgical icus , neurosurgical icus , neurological icus , mixed - surgical icus , internal icus , UNK icus ) .    1.9466815856882438
the personality organisation and the process of therapy of drug - addicted patients are examined by the comparative analysis of 15 single cases .    2.389087937571334
the antisocial tendency is emphasised as the main clinical feature .    2.5293676010747084
it is related to specific genetic traumata and the UNK of parts of the superego .    3.1334959211252364
during the therapeutical process , the antisocial tendency UNK the therapeutical relation .    2.3106170155400054
if it is possible to continue therapy beyond this point , the patients can now enter into a process , in which new UNK and the integration of parts of the superego are involved .    2.786994160660338
approaching the end of the therapy , patients , again , tend to UNK the results of therapy if one does not consider specific problems of the separation process .    3.0322552516083
objective : the UNK - definition of leukoplakia has recently UNK oral leukoplakia .    2.66651015387198
based on this definition , the aim of our study was to reevaluate the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with histologically proven primary oral cancer .    2.8295568988234767
design : a total of 101 inpatients in four tumor centers in berlin were interviewed and clinically examined just prior to surgery of an oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) .    2.296047190721025
results : the prevalence of leukoplakia immediately adjacent to the carcinoma was 15 . 8 % .    2.856364832386062
additional UNK without relation to the carcinoma were found in 4 % of the patients .    3.5891417346592185
there were no significant differences in age - or sex - distribution , history of tobacco habits or diet between patients with or without leukoplakia .    2.3144414345765965
t1 carcinomas were found in 62 . 5 % of patients with , and 24 . 4 % of patients without associated leukoplakia , whereas a balanced distribution was found for the pre - operative staging of the tumor .    3.3077745922851505
conclusions : the prevalence of oral leukoplakia in patients with oscc was low , compared to retrospective studies .    2.7802178590062017
the presence or absence of leukoplakia indicated no influence on the prognosis of the tumor , except of tumor size .    2.6299842207432187
the results emphasize that most oscc develop from healthy appearing oral mucosa .    2.059157893503076
cutaneous angiosarcomas mainly arise on the scalp and face of older patients .    2.2293795747915484
they present with reddish nodules or plaques and tend to UNK and UNK .    2.4466241066893386
angiosarcomas show an aggressive and recurrent course and have a high potential for metastasis .    2.5783521453870653
we report on a 48 - year - old patient with unilateral eyelid edema as the first manifestation of an angiosarcoma .    2.552258260315044
the clinical presentation , the history of contact allergy , the presence of antinuclear antibodies , and abnormal thyroid function tests favoured a non - neoplastic disease .    2.5847032761574753
however , multiple biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of a highly differentiated angiosarcoma .    3.17284737031405
staging of the patient revealed no metastasis .    3.723210151052464
after radical surgery including orbital UNK and postoperative radiation therapy , no recurrence was observed with a follow up of 26 months .    2.2810145888720843
this case underlines the importance of including angiosarcoma in the differential diagnosis of unilateral eyelid edema .    2.6061772898396933
the marburg cardiomyopathy study ( UNK ) is a prospective observational study designed to determine the value of the following potential non - invasive arrhythmia risk predictors in more than 200 patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy ( idc ) over a 5 - year - follow - up period : new york heart association functional class , left ventricular end - diastolic diameter and ejection fraction , left bundle branch block and atrial fibrillation on ecg , qtc and UNK - dispersion on 12 - lead ecg , abnormal time - domain analysis and spectral UNK analysis of the signal - averaged ecg , ventricular arrhythmias and heart - rate variability on 24 - hour holter ecg , baroreflex sensitivity , and UNK t wave UNK during exercise .    2.33911146156718
abstract the observation of extremely variable clinical courses for patients with renal cell carcinomas of an identical pathological stage as well as a comparable histological differentiation resp .    2.679054206703625
growth pattern strongly indicates the existence of tumors UNK different biological aggressiveness .    2.3496600038726303
currently available histopathological classification systems do not predict the biological behaviour of renal cell cancer as sufficiently as the establishment of a therapeutical strategy adjusted to the individual patient would require .    2.372947767870291
the need for a more refined characterization of the biological potential of the UNK tumor results from the introduction of modified operative strategies as organ - preserving surgery , for example , as well as from the recently suggested application of an adjuvant systemic therapy adapted to the individual risk for tumor recurrence resp .    2.776589894592976
the development of progressive disease .    2.9662425717933423
therefore , the clinically orientated basic scientist and the basic scientifically orientated clinician intensively try to determine prognostically important biological variables which would allow to better predict the biological aggressiveness of a single tumor in addition to " classical " prognostic parameters ( t - stage , histological grading , growth patterns ) .    2.0147852163629043
in this context , several biological parameters including the identification of alterations on the dna - , rna - and protein level have been discussed as possible biological prognostic markers for renal cell cancer .    2.0774332189092837
the present review tries to reflect currently available biological characteristics of rcc which might gain clinical importance with regard to an individualized therapy in the near future .    2.2146827717790436
until now reports of factitious disease have not been found in the ent literature .    2.9998088244108994
in order to achieve effective treatment for these patients , knowledge of the characteristic symptoms is fundamental .    3.079669594868599
the present paper describes the variety of disease possible , using three cases treated between 1992 and 1994 in the ent department of cologne .    2.3263299197091194
according to the literature , females are involved in a ratio of 9 : 1 , with the majority working in medically related professions .    2.718634635872683
depression and anorexia are typical symptoms .    2.5818455539873217
when a factitious disease is suspected , psychiatric consultation is essential .    2.4855913266369214
confrontation of a suspect patient by the UNK is not often considered because several reports UNK suicidal behavior in up to 25 % of self - manipulating patients and tendencies to refuse to follow psychiatric treatment are considerable .    2.495437913418176
numerous different diseases lead to scarring alopecia with irreversible follicular destruction as a common ending .    2.172545683668853
current classifications are based on clinical , histopathological or prognostic parameters , as well as on pathogenetic criteria which allow only a UNK assessment because the precise mechanisms leading to scarring alopecia are still unknown .    2.2973487538021056
UNK of the established classifications are obvious when regarding special forms of scarring alopecia like lichen UNK or UNK UNK .    2.7142477345007583
in order to develop more satisfying classifications , recent insights into biology and pathology of the hair follicle and follicular cycling have to be considered .    2.194193729551818
the most important structures for the survival of the hair follicle are the epithelial stem cells which UNK in the follicular UNK and the fibroblasts of the dermal UNK including the molecular communication between these two cell populations .    2.489227049400855
research in the field of scarring alopecia should aim at defining the pathological processes on any of the above mentioned levels which will lead to an irreversible damage of the hair follicle thus allowing the development of new therapeutic agents .    2.6876154534090753
rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis is a rare dermatologic disorder seen in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis .    3.1647733588842413
clinically firm erythematous 3 - 5 mm papules are found mainly on the arms , the hips and the proximal thighs .    2.3318165821670664
the lesions may be pruritic leading to UNK and crusts .    2.979826019390899
histology reveals a dense dermal infiltrate with neutrophilic granulocytes , while UNK may be seen , UNK is not observed .    2.532095398142273
this overview of rheumatoid neutrophilic dermatitis may help UNK the UNK to include this uncommon disorder in the differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis - related dermatoses .    2.6853265320370925
background : the rehabilitation of low vision patients is of increasing importance since the number of these patients has grown rapidly .    2.852247066687324
we wanted to evaluate the actual spectrum of patients concerning age and diagnoses and the appropriate low vision aids ( UNK ) in 1 year .    2.6106531085686906
it is generally accepted that most inguinal hernias should be operated electively .    2.085492997959769
this study presents a risk calculation challenging this view .    2.3893491719151387
three strategies are presented : prophylactic indication on principle ( a ) , elective operation in every second case ( b ) , and operation in case of strangulation only ( c ) .    2.6387881495391188
on the basis of available epidemiological data it is calculated that , for the male german population aged 65 years and over 69 UNK ( a ) , 36 292 ( b ) , and UNK ( c ) inguinal hernia repairs would be necessary annually ; UNK ( a ) , 145 ( b ) and 123 ( c ) perioperative deaths would occur , connected with UNK ( a ) , UNK ( b ) and UNK ( c ) years of life lost , respectively .    2.528358858204621
thus , operation of every inguinal hernia would result in a ( small ) reduction of life expectancy .    2.4638505504694597
these data provide evidence that in elderly patients the indication for operative treatment of inguinal hernias should depend upon symptoms and suffering .    2.559105202635336
there is no reason to operate on asymptomatic patients because of a presumed risk of strangulation .    2.5709451891717414
since first described by kibler ( 1955 ) UNK areas of the skin in company with arthropathy or diseases of internal organs are known to be a useful sign to define the affected segment .    2.5920248829817796
while seldom utilized by physicians , physiotherapists frequently make use of these special findings concerning the skin as a common part of their daily work .    2.211602280334408
a certain problem exists in ranging correctly the corresponding segment of the spine , this mostly caused by the inaccurate idea of anatomical facts .    2.3617870669967505
the actual as well as the former literature in this field shows very different views and opinions , all of them rather in contrast to the real anatomical findings .    2.6054337595986565
in the following the topographic - anatomic conditions are presented of which exact knowledge is necessary to evaluate the palpation ' s result " kibler ' s plica positive " relative to its diagnostic UNK .    2.114369690083293
aim of the study and methods : in the present study the correlation between ischemia induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias and a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials was investigated .    2.8053057659216707
in 16 patients with significant coronary artery disease and survived sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia an electrophysiologic study ( eps ) was performed .    2.533954079093293
before eps ( t1 ) , at every stimulation interval and after induction of a ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation ( vt / vf ) the lactate concentration was measured in arterial blood and in the coronary sinus for calculation of the myocardial lactate extraction .    2.3057733359990964
nine patients showed a so - called " lactate reversal " , i . e . , an increase of the lactate concentration in the coronary sinus over the concentration of the arterial blood as an expression of ischemia development , during inducibility of a vt / vf ( group a ) .    2.5541373636345464
results : in group a significant changes of the three late potential criteria were found between t1 and t2 ( qrs : 115 . 61 + / - 13 . 86 vs . 126 . 06 + / - 16 . 74 , p = 0 . 08 ; rms : 25 . 81 + / - 22 . 26 vs . 13 . 11 + / - 10 . 72 , p = 0 . 01 ; las : 37 . 72 + / - 19 . 26 vs . 50 . 06 + / - 10 . 72 , p = 0 . 01 ) .    2.5228980917697474
in group b , no significant changes could be measured .    2.8862231880684552
furthermore , the prevalence of late potentials increased in group a from 66 % ( t1 ) to 89 % ( t2 ) , whereas in group b no increase was detectable .    2.597546849176342
conclusions : these data suggest a dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials in correlation with the inducibility of ventricular UNK due to ischemic circumstances .    2.398079273903841
therefore the dynamic behavior of ventricular late potentials can be an expression of a modification of the arrhythmogenic substrate in arrhythmia endangered patients .    2.271062542619339
recent studies and reviews continue to report a high mortality associated with the acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ards ) , which involves a severe inflammatory reaction within the whole lung that is frequently associated with multiple - organ failure .    2.2807766464570984
important factors contributing to the poor results in severe ards are the aggressive procedures required to maintain sufficient arterial oxygenation , such as mechanical ventilation with high inspiratory pressures and high inspired oxygen concentrations ( fio2 ) which themselves contribute to the progression of the disease .    2.2677677793106876
as no specific therapy that reduces or prevents the general inflammatory reaction is known , current therapy is limited to procedures that minimize peak inspiratory pressures and fio2 .    2.065397474013844
therefore , pressure - and volume - limited ventilation modes with positive end - expiratory pressure , controlled hypercapnia , differential lung ventilation when appropriate , positioning ( particularly prone ) , and aggressive dehydration are used .    2.0344138620861987
should these procedures fail to improve arterial gas exchange , the patients may be additionally treated by UNK - venous extracorporeal gas exchange .    2.4961536245501104
to reduce the risk of severe haemorrhagic complications due to high levels of systemic UNK , systems internally coated with UNK bound heparin , which allow a lower level of systemic anticoagulation , should be used .    2.4491494321485803
from april 1989 to august 1993 , 89 patients were transferred to our intensive care unit for treatment of severe ards ; 52 were treated by combining the described conventional methods without artificial gas exchange ( survival rate 88 % ) and 37 additionally underwent artificial gas exchange ( survival rate 57 % ) .    2.253745800537164
the overall survival rate was 75 % .    2.744193907045918
on the basis of these experiences , we conclude that this step - by - step approach may improve survival in patients with severe ards .    2.6027204094998853
in 50 % of cases there are associated anomalies of other organ systems .    2.9184658938498
clinical improvement of the cutaneous manifestations is noted in most cases and usually occurs during the first year of life .    2.9932389789569873
we present a patient with cmtc with a band - like pattern following the l3 UNK .    2.283244256388801
at the age of 13 years , the skin manifestations worsened , with ulcerations and intermittent claudication .    2.6116628300360336
angiographic imaging revealed stenosis of the deep femoral artery , and the circumflex femoral artery and the first perforating arteries were not visualized .    3.004906025801698
to our knowledge , this is the first reported case of cmtc with anomalies of the large arteries .    2.3089305360787233
introduction : the efficacy of vascular surgery in the treatment of popliteal arterial aneurysms ( paa ) and the justification of conservative therapy was investigated in the present study .    3.2985117662934473
materials and methods : from january 1985 to december 1996 , 87 patients were operated on for paa .    2.52686940626372
the clinical records were reviewed retrospectively and patients were categorized concerning paa - related symptoms , vascular run - off , and material used for vascular reconstruction .    2.0077204003961686
patients were examined , and the patency of the vascular reconstruction was checked by palpation and doppler sonography .    2.94033742842198
results : the cumulative survival calculated using the kaplan - meier curve was 70 % after 10 years .    2.0495103398587817
asymptomatic patients had the best results and patients with acute ischemia , the worst .    3.352175062132506
the outcome concerning patent vs . occluded run - off and autologous vs . heterologous bypass material was similar .    1.958917102176599
conclusion : asymptomatic and uncomplicated paa should be treated surgically .    2.376879440911199
only paa with a diameter less than 2 cm , and without thrombus on the vessel walls can be treated conservatively .    2.5914154443300683
collodion baby is a clinical description for a transient condition of the newborn which is caused by various disorders of cornification .    2.598115722332975
the majority of cases are due to autosomal recessive lamellar ichthyosis .    2.5011887999849884
in up to 10 % of cases " self - healing " of the skin occurs .    3.8592199064781365
we report about a mature male baby who at birth was covered entirely with a UNK , collodion - like membrane .    2.217107597235156
there also were marked ectropion of the eyelids and eversion of the lips .    2.2017823892784483
after UNK of the membrane almost complete UNK of the skin occurred until the age of three months .    3.66651635296227
past research on the phenomenon of enhanced pain sensitivity in fibromyalgia syndome ( fs ) revealed evidence for both a higher pain magnitude in response to nociceptive stimuli ( hyperalgesia ) and a general perceptual amplification of sensations ( hypervigilance ) .    2.0540388217150634
in order to distinguish between these two aspects of disturbed sensory processing in fs , cerebral evoked potentials after brief painful laser and auditory stimuli were measured in 10 fs patients .    2.0581093346875576
results were compared with those from age - matched painfree controls .    2.707603992826148
amplitudes of middle - latency ( n1 ) and long - latency ( p2 ) laser evoked potentials ( leps ) were significantly higher in fs than in controls .    2.2951388243515805
furthermore , laser intensity at pain but not at sensation threshold was lower in fs than in controls .    1.9536123534234096
however , auditory evoked potentials ( UNK ) did not differ between groups .    3.268046115268222
enhanced n1 and p2 amplitudes of leps suggest stronger sensory and attentional processing of nociceptive information in fs , respectively .    1.8969719116923955
the concept of hypervigilance is challenged by the failure to find differences in auditory perception among fs and control patients .    2.084132371928741
yet , the importance of unpleasant intensities of auditory stimulation , not applied in this study , to reveal abnormal non - nociceptive perceptual amplification in fs is discussed .    2.330159637312634
in a prospective study , 53 fractures of the distal fifth of the tibia were stabilized by unreamed nailing .    2.607483231832012
additional involvement of the ankle joint occurred in 18 patients .    3.035391907262029
50 patients returned for follow - up .    2.6604057600652613
in 30 patients tibia and fibula were fractured at the same ( distal ) level ; in 20 patients the fracture of the fibula was located more proximally .    2.4184275169894724
in 12 patients the fractures extended into the tibial pilon .    2.421479062530996
severe soft tissue damage was seen in 24 fractures ( 18 open , 6 closed ) .    2.463310961249451
ninety percent of all fractures healed uneventfully without further surgical intervention after unreamed nailing .    2.3560813593397683
in two patients the unreamed nail had to be exchanged for a reamed tibial nail .    2.4513397862083
bone grafting and secondary dynamization of the nail by removal of a proximal interlocking bolt were performed in one case each .    2.7436751483542694
thirty - one fractures healed in anatomical position .    2.300077749005077
valgus or varus angulation of less than 5 ° occurred in 18 patients .    2.5624760368930537
one fracture healed with rotatory angulation of 15 ° .    2.3506439041174456
the highest rate of complications ( 22 % ) was seen in patients with distal fractures of the fibula without additional plating ( of the fibula ) .    3.2026140236050886
there was no deep infection .    2.61547542686161
tibial fractures close to the ankle joint can be managed by unreamed nailing .    3.04457821593147
distal fractures of the fibula should be stabilized by additional plating .    3.0288346202973733
because of the unreamed technique of implantation this procedure can also be used in grade ii or iii open fractures .    2.4940055338435854
complex mechanisms have evolved in mammalian cells for regulating cellular UNK .    2.2321850334289564
normal cells demonstrate a strictly limited growth potential and senescence after a defined number of cell divisions .    2.0359727711089746
in contrast , tumor cells often exhibit an apparently unlimited proliferation potential and are termed UNK .    2.0594656900835226
it has been proposed that the progressive shortening of the tips of the UNK chromosomes - the telomeres - is an important component of senescence and is involved in the control of cell cycle .    2.9447734161846477
the enzyme telomerase adds UNK repeats onto mammalian telomeres , preventing their shortening .    2.058594959735587
telomerase is normally inactive in most somatic cells , but detectable in tumor cells .    2.2371366719801458
the activation of telomerase in malignant cancers seems to be an important step in UNK in order to gain the ability of indefinite proliferation and to become UNK .    2.817248536226988
this review describes the present knowledge of telomeres and telomerase and their role in cellular senescence and human aging .    2.140999804099546
it summarizes aspects of telomerase in cancer and its function as a diagnostic and prognostic tumor marker .    2.466942393550948
pcr - based diagnosis of infectious diseases has developed into an important method in surgical pathology .    2.190535566496385
we summarize our experience in this area based on UNK analyses performed during the past 5 years .    2.89503502245071
the peculiarity of material from a pathological laboratory is the risk of dna fragmentation as a consequence of tissue fixation .    2.527330689790705
for this reason the assays used must be adapted to this particular situation .    2.209970619772142
pcr - based diagnosis of infectious diseases , if performed according to appropriate quality standards , is a safe and effective technique with high sensitivity and specificity and results in an etiologically based diagnosis .    2.2391927263708826
the shift of age distribution within the population of industrialized societies has led to an increased need of treating diseases in elderly patients and at the same time in a higher number of patients bearing an increased operative risk .    2.513885725562511
today , the development of surgical techniques and intensive care treatment enables us to carry out numerous procedures in geriatric patients .    2.8259144316349474
innovative surgical techniques like minimal invasive surgery with minor trauma due to the surgical approach changed patient ' s categories , also .    2.9028730832530996
taken together with other procedures causing less operative stress indications for patients who were not operable previously have changed .    2.2920499313513147
new developments such as organ transplantation and immunosuppression also generated totally new groups of patients with very distinct conditions for the operative procedure .    2.4666154863577243
UNK indications or selection of patients as in peptic ulcer disease changed the surgical approach completely : negative selection has shifted elective operative interventions in ulcer disease to emergency procedures .    2.0391259458001763
contrasting experiences made in most other countries and especially in the third world , in germany economic restrictions have not been encountered as of yet .    2.530908887595143
from the physicians viewpoint we have to actively participate in this development by personal interaction with the patient , by interdisciplinary cooperation and prompt social and political action .    2.3231340036218673
because of their small size they can be approached by minimally invasive surgical procedures .    2.5131529947946203
we treated ten symptomatic patients with osteoid osteomas ( n 6 hip point , n 1 iliac bone , n 1 femoral diaphysis , n2 tibial diaphysis ) by excision of the nidus with a 3 - mm UNK - wood needle using a percutaneous ct - guided approach .    1.9478533909229208
seven patients with residual tumor were treated with either UNK ( n 2 ) or sclerosis with 1 ml of 96 % ethanol ( n 5 ) .    2.4556062021602822
six patients had UNK and constant relief ( 3 years ' observation ) of their pain .    2.311032124828979
in two patients a second transcutaneous intervention was successful .    2.6051499953419195
only two patients needed open resection .    2.9141015205701417
compared with the invasive open resection of the tumors , sometimes even putting the stability of the femoral neck at risk , transcutaneous ct - guided enucleation of the nidus of the osteoid osteoma with additional sclerotherapy is a good alternative method , especially in the region of the femoral neck .    2.662960319960895
we live in an UNK that could be designated as the post - UNK - era .    3.109249949187914
writing is no longer the dominant sign system .    2.75141894220184
it is replaced by electronic signs .    2.4781784275295022
we consider approximately the year 1950 as the turning - point between these two UNK , because by then , in the years after the 2nd world war the american UNK were saturated with UNK .    2.3301491351436474
thereby , the new sign system UNK itself .    2.559844231846731
the topic of this article is the transformation of our sign system and thereby of our UNK of UNK , the leap from the world of written signs into the world of electronic signs , and the possibility born out of it to create electronic objects , which i prefer to call virtual objects .    2.341509191858415
the manipulation of object - choice and object - relationships accompanying this change and the role assigned to analysts in this new world will be considered as well .    1.9849732631414103
these electronic signs developed quickly a life of their own .    2.390020011667845
these are electronically transformed , completed or UNK electronically produced objects .    2.083283505364124
this procedure is accompanied by an industrialization of object - choice and object - relationships .    2.383582561248887
the manipulated object - choice and object - relationship is born and , moreover , a displacement of natural objects through virtual ones .    1.8838751918662107
a change of the socio - cultural understanding is also a consequence of this process .    2.6177260368491013
new patterns of socio - cultural understanding develop , that could be described as industrial UNK .    2.3342695405469214
the goal of this article is to describe the transformation of our world of signs and the connected industrialization of object relationships , and to UNK them according to our present possibilities .    2.449214530109273
in this article 34 randomized controlled trials examining peripherally mediated opioid effects after knee surgery are discussed .    2.0190833623546736
all studies examined small doses of morphine injected intraarticularly at the end of knee surgery , but not all studies did show an analgesic effect of the peripheral opioid .    2.5094109490255296
because of differing study designs a meta - analysis of the data is not possible .    2.666457118568663
dysplastic epithelia represent potentially UNK conditions in which the risk of progression to cancer is unknown in the individual case .    2.7210795957217613
the positive predictive value of mild and moderate dysplasias of the uterine cervix is only about 13 % .    2.2071120125189028
using dna image cytometry on UNK , conventional UNK - smears the cytometric equivalent of chromosomal aneuploidy can be detected as marker for neoplastic transformation of cells .    1.9454835365458545
the identification of dna aneuploidy in dysplastic squamous epithelia can increase the predictive value for malignant transformation to over 90 % .    2.3136883296187714
dna aneuploidy UNK squamous intraepithelial lesions as high grade ( h - sil ) which have to be treated whereas lack of dna aneuploidy characterizes low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions ( l - sil ) which have only to be controlled .    2.102013604917603
the methodology is meanwhile internationally standardized concerning performance and diagnostic interpretation .    2.143201783787682
in this brief article i attempt to UNK a few salient insights from my career as a UNK and practitioner of psychotherapy : the key to successful therapy is undoubtedly the therapist ' s empathic UNK , coupled with a series of other positive attributes and UNK UNK interpersonal skills .    2.159938103171168
on the UNK side , patients ' UNK frequently evokes UNK from the therapist which not infrequently results in a negative outcome .    2.602255548817062
percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a procedure for inserting a tracheal cannula without a large incision , without extensive dissection of UNK tissue , and without exposure of the trachea .    2.2041451579913267
the early complications of the technique are usually minor and late complications are rare .    2.7654714892745385
although it is a simple procedure , it is not a minor operation .    3.7876079200991972
users must be familiar with the technique , the indications and contra - indications for the procedure , as well as the complications .    3.0671180280253
proper training of the operation and knowledge of the procedure will avoid unnecessary complications .    3.0707994381376724
percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy is a relatively new technique for inserting a cannula in the tracheal lumen .    2.2522217126547726
it can be done at the patients bedside with only minimal complications .    2.50775989574756
in this study , a histologic and histomorphometric analysis of delayed and immediate - placed implants was performed .    2.0948693362008033
an implantation of 16 self - cutting UNK titanium screw implants was carried out in 8 UNK dogs .    2.301403864138543
for dynamic histomorphometry , UNK bone markers were injected at two different times prior to euthanasia .    2.0226896608897684
the specimens were examined macroscopically and microscopically 8 months after implantation .    2.4344155748256626
a histologic , dynamic , and static histomorphometry was performed with the aid of different computer programs .    2.551292327718498
a mean surface of osseointegration of 75 . 7 % and a mean soft tissue implant contact surface of 24 . 2 % was seen in immediate - placed implants .    2.6050478887592843
for delayed implantation , an osseointegrated surface of 80 . 7 % and a soft tissue covering of 19 . 3 % was examined .    2.7550536253112576
the fibrogenic structures in the cervical implant part were more dense and there were more adhesive epithelial elements ( UNK ) around delayed implants .    2.349728328874911
the result of the dynamic and static histomorphometry showed no significant differences in the two groups ( p < 0 . 1 ) .    3.4813717494781296
in conclusion , it can be stated that a new steady - state of the soft and hard tissue around dental implants was seen 8 months after implant insertion in both groups .    2.3609137970086462
there was a UNK healing in the osseous part .    2.4490611238955315
the lower level of osseointegration in immediate - placed implants was caused by early resorption of bone in the UNK part .    2.5386368613661072
thus , a larger part of the implant was surrounded by soft tissue and a long epithelial attachment resulted .    2.6654730856199267
UNK may be UNK or tibial ( UNK ) , UNK or ulnar ( side of the little toe ) and central ( middle toes ) .    2.8943803494232627
the duplication may appear at the distal and medial phalanges or at the whole digit .    2.2620402726673188
the metatarsal bone may be UNK or completely UNK , the accessory toes may share only one metatarsal .    2.4762004393388435
surgical intervention may be indicated in shoeproblems , for esthetic reasons or , especially in duplication of the UNK , because of secondary deviation of the toes and therefore shoeproblems or plantar UNK .    2.5398708095561435
preoperative analysis including x - ray is of great importance to achieve good functional and cosmetic results .    2.722728308331595
across centers , transfusion can vary UNK for the same mediastinal drainage after adult cardiac operations .    2.3494005702641303
excessive blood drainage resulting in increased transfusions occurs in 29 % of patients .    2.4735510626790247
avoidance of preoperative anemia , tolerance of low hemoglobin concentrations , the use of autologous blood , and adherence to a strict transfusion protocol will reduce the use of allogenic transfusions .    2.5762599105460153
perioperatively , maintenance of UNK contributes to improved hemostasis .    2.41686274861963
injections with botulinum toxin type a ( btx ) are considered the first - line treatment for UNK UNK ( st ) , UNK ( bl ) and UNK UNK ( hfs ) .    2.985284708839235
the subjective rating of all therapies ever tried by patients with st , bl and hfs was evaluated by using a simple questionnaire .    2.2316943294597857
two hundred questionnaires were considered ( 112 ts , 54 bl , 34 hfs ) .    2.0025127465345425
btx was rated subjectively the best therapy in all three diagnostic groups ( median : 2 = good effect ) .    2.328466631036469
despite citalopram and physiotherapy ( median : 3 = average effect ) , all other therapies were rated with a median of > = 4 ( = minimal effect ) .    2.32111525017116
patients with st tried 7 . 7 , patients with bl 2 . 4 and patients with hfs 2 . 6 different types of therapy .    2.9947841222064215
in conclusion , btx is the most effective treatment for patients with st , bl and hfs , as rated subjectively .    2.4426873510804046
further evaluation of therapies additional to btx injections is recommended .    2.32552044709256
the perioperative morbidity and mortality is mainly influenced by the type and duration of surgery as well as the patient ' s preoperative state of health .    3.4213928403622087
anesthesia per se , however , may also result in severe perioperative ( UNK ) physiological changes , which may be both desired ( e . g .    2.777920444948909
analgesia , vasodilation in vascular surgery ) or detrimental ( e . g .    2.1924526024975526
hypothermia , ventilatory depression ) and which may differ depending on the anesthetic technique used ( e . g .    2.2828296602983262
general anesthesia vs . regional anesthesia ) .    2.4688338754998687
yet , all UNK techniques have in common , that their effects are not limited to the duration of the surgical intervention , but may expand far into the postoperative period .    2.841427505168032
therefore , many trials have been performed in the past aiming to compare the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the incidence of postoperative techniques , no significant advantage of one or the other technique has been identified up to now with respect to postoperative mortality or severe morbidity .    2.86662388564299
this finding may be due to at least three factors .    2.9295269392742886
1 ) many side - effects related to anesthesia - due to close postoperative monitoring - are detected and treated early in the postoperative phase ( e . g .    2.1795271428736025
in the recovery room ) , thereby preventing serious complications .    2.431273234855589
2 ) postoperative mortality related exclusively to anesthesia probably is so low , that huge patient numbers would be required to demonstrate any significant differences between different techniques .    2.07957576619946
3 ) besides the factor ' anesthesia ' , may other factors contribute to the anesthesia related morbidity and mortality ( e . g .    2.261927665687952
the factor ' UNK ' ) which are hardly quantified .    2.5379968343999906
rather there may be good reasons in the individual patient ( e . g .    2.618935239581241
lack of a recovery room ) , to prefer a certain anesthetic technique or drug over another , in order to lower the individual risk of anesthesia .    2.4763331490549354
whether the use of a certain technique - e . g .    2.9923373518492222
spinal or epidural anesthesia - may contribute to a reduction of specific postoperative surgical complications ( e . g .    2.449135403108754
rate of UNK subsequent to peripheral vascular surgery ) is presently under investigation .    2.5752133917209137
this paper first describes how the project study on the regulation and monitoring of medical treatment arose .    2.479435592789852
we then introduce its objectives , the members of the study group , the composition of the collective and selection of cases , and the methods used for UNK and recording of data .    3.2267965395690887
results are then presented with reference to the various hypotheses put forward .    2.6827615902348234
after some introductory remarks about the traumatizing experience many parents have after the birth of a very small preterm baby ( < = 1500 g ) , a developmental risk model is presented .    2.123483866796902
this is the basis for an early beginning preventive psychotherapeutic intervention .    2.7072261283748897
in the ulm study the comprehensive parent - centered intervention program includes insight oriented focal individual psychotherapy , supportive group psychotherapy , a home visit and a video - based sensitivity training .    1.8916522342122324
the intervention aims to improve parental coping , the process of attachment and parent - infant interaction .    2.23081522838719
the theoretical implications , the design and the methods of this prospective randomized longitudinal study will be discussed .    2.4832168120284743
we report the case of a 55 - year - old male patient who underwent transanal endoscopic microsurgery for recurrent benign rectal adenoma .    2.2357754696085888
he developed severe postoperative retroperitoneal phlegmon and sepsis and died 28 days after the operation due to UNK diffuse intraabdominal bleeding caused by persistent thrombocytopenia .    2.3406554503620667
rudolf nissen was born in UNK , UNK , 9 september 1896 .    3.074577755181781
from UNK to 1933 he was the favorite pupil of ferdinand UNK in munich and berlin .    2.2505335353440907
1930 he became professor of surgery at the charité .    2.3151079028863317
he took over the surgical chair in UNK , UNK .    2.896855637338033
nissen died in UNK / basel on 22 january 1981 .    2.456714074072111
nissen was a critical UNK clinician , an efficient and popular physician , a UNK and a UNK .    2.7887446613360507
of historical significance are pioneering works in thoracic surgery , the first successful UNK in man , the classical works about the treatment of gastro - oesophageal reflux disease and UNK hernia .    2.531767915960733
the nissen - rossetti type of fundoplication has remained the standard procedure in europe and the usa .    2.341961887711471
this study describes the approach that is necessary in outpatient surgery in order to carry out the operation safely .    2.727049244919968
the particular procedure is discussed , and the necessity of strict postoperative management is shown .    3.1806562829014258
between 1994 and 1997 , the author supervised UNK outpatient operations , of which UNK were arthroscopic .    2.3274774884747735
the observed complications are listed and evaluated .    2.4830589973014847
overall , outpatient surgery is well accepted by the patients .    2.9261644756511465
the criteria for denying a patient surgery on an outpatient basis are laid out .    2.2473770133713313
the schering atlas is a teaching file in ct and mri anatomy designed for physicians and students .    2.2911888295257934
it is available on cd - rom , shows good image quality , and is easy to use in medium - price - range personal computer systems .    2.207356635450902
because of the amount and quality of image material , the schering atlas ' s price is appropriate for institutions , but not for private users .    2.3293106797273655
m . UNK developed " dialectical behavioral therapy " specifically to treat chronically suicidal borderline patients .    2.1210739077332827
it rests on a UNK model that UNK a disorder in the regulation of emotions and in tolerance of stress .    2.4422440088632844
the numerous dysfunctional patterns of behavior such as self - destructive behavior , inability to UNK impulses or severe UNK phenomena are regarded as attempts at problem - solving .    1.8231848084149878
this concept of therapy focuses on the continuing balance between the necessity of accepting maladaptive behavior patterns in both an intrapsychic and an interactional context while still working to change them .    2.031053297268241
a comprehensive manual outlines the clearly structured therapy and integrates a wide choice of therapeutic strategies .    2.0626533660939597
parallel to development of the therapy itself , a method also was developed for testing therapist adherence to the manual ' s guidelines , thus providing a basis for empirical evaluation .    2.3160948655443985
an initial controlled , randomized study demonstrated the significant superiority of this method to methods of unspecific psychotherapy at various levels .    2.2734777775097688
in the current UNK to develop disorder - specific approaches to the treatment of personality disorders , " dialectical behavioral therapy " is a noteworthy model .    2.6007714864809435
complications associated with the application of a halo device are not infrequent ; however , osteomyelitis of the skull with a consecutive subdural abscess is a rare but severe complication .    2.9604786388241404
we present the case of a patient with a subdural abscess as a result of a local pin - track infection of the halo device , in whom pathological behavior was the primary clinical finding .    2.518434284618363
the attempt was made to explain dysfunctions of the motor system - UNK to electronic data processing systems - as a speciality of the regulation part of the motor system .    2.207165307132208
thereby dysfunctions can be seen as UNK variables in the regulation software with not defined or unknown values of afferences or combination of afferences .    2.22404719459603
this leads to a failure of the corresponding software modul that results in the loss of function which is regulated through this modul .    2.656327113710664
especially with changing of afference through manual treatment or through UNK , a replacement of the variables can be reached and this leads to normal function .    2.504009885838146
with this hypothesis all UNK of dysfunctions can be explained .    2.5495306463655476
empirical data on costs of care for chronically mentally ill patients in germany are rare .    2.4493805948413043
there is a lack of cross - sectional studies as well as of any analysis of the long - term course of mental health care costs .    3.096465818577012
this study combines data from two cost - studies on patients with schizophrenia , conducted in the same catchment area at an interval of 15 years , to draw conclusions about the long - term course of these costs .    2.3591901546621723
the direct costs of comprehensive community based mental health care had increased by 77 . 0 % during 15 years , while the costs of a UNK stay in a long - term ward of a psychiatric hospital had increased by 78 . 5 % in the same period .    2.796083876761147
this increase was 27 and 28 . 5 per cent higher than the general rise in cost of living in germany during the interval between the two studies .    2.468266737233787
this higher - than - average increase in mental health care costs was accompanied by a much higher cost - effectiveness .    2.3278764074682603
thus , this rise of costs must be seen as a consequence of the great deficits and the resulting basic improvement of care for chronically mentally ill patients in germany , which was demanded by an expert - commission of the government in the mid - seventies .    2.513215986355351
background : the usefulness of holter monitoring to detect rarely occuring symptoms seems to be limited .    2.466428300871205
in adults the event recorder has already been a precise diagnostic tool in evaluating UNK and UNK .    2.381748631037432
there have been few reports of the implementation of cardiac monitoring with an event recorder in children .    2.3287802502939066
the immunomodulating effect of primary surgical intervention was investigated in 33 patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity , pharynx and larynx .    2.428458772985872
an operation time longer than 7 h was significantly associated with a decrease in lymphocytes , cd4 + t - lymphocytes and cd8 + t - lymphocytes .    2.309632505370364
the cd4 / cd8 - ratio as a marker for the down - regulation of the cellular immune response was slightly decreased but was still in the normal range .    2.3368900024718857
cd4 - lymphocyte counts increased 7 days after operation while cd8 lymphocytes were found elevated 4 weeks after UNK .    2.1731037466488323
the in vitro stimulation of the lymphocytes was impaired for 1 to 4 weeks .    2.5089446951669263
UNK , interferon - gamma and tumor necrosis factor did not show any changes after surgery .    2.4416568858415455
both preclinical and clinical evidence support the usefulness of antidepressants in chronic pain treatment .    2.694108511145774
monoamine uptake inhibitors influence the UNK of noradrenaline ( na ) and / or serotonin ( 5 - ht ) ; their effect on nociception is thought to take place predominantly within the spinal cord .    2.6353175964751583
antidepressant drugs seem to differ in their properties as analgesics and as UNK .    2.47404486895163
the present work is aimed at correlating the special mechanism of action of antidepressants in diminishing UNK with the pharmacological profile of these drugs in clinical pain treatment .    2.3735887984801356
the analgesic profile of antidepressants was established by a metaanalysis of clinical trials on the effect of these drugs , given alone or in combination with other analgetics , in chronic pain syndromes .    2.618954821384182
57 clinical trials were separated into 5 groups according to their scientific quality : [ 1 ] placebo - controlled double - blind studies with high power ; [ 2 ] placebo - controlled double - blind studies with low power ; [ 3 - 4 ] open controlled studies or studies with historical controls ; [ 5 ] case reports .    2.0724297940128356
a study was positive if the tested antidepressant was more effective than placebo or the compared drug or seemed beneficial with respect to the interval of its previous absence .    2.2031035629423577
the most effective antidepressants in chronic pain treatment only included UNK monoamine reuptake inhibitors in the following rank order : UNK > UNK > = UNK > = imipramine > = UNK .    2.323968631472254
a statement about the appropriate dosage of these drugs in chronic pain treatment , however , must wait for properly conducted dose finding studies which include the measurement of plasma concentrations .    2.477031188643776
intensive care medicine for both surgical and medical patients has a common scientific and clinical basis .    2.517811166739408
in critically ill patients the medical conditions are complex and can be managed only by specialists thoroughly trained in intensive care medicine .    2.492708390021227
therefore , surgeons as well as anesthesiologists must have a detailed theoretical and clinical knowledge of intensive care medicine .    2.4738708886130434
surgical training places the emphasis on operative skills , while intraoperative management of the patient by the anesthesiologist calls for skills involved in intensive care medicine .    2.26578044628941
interdisciplinary cooperation between specialists is essential to improve the quality of intensive care medicine further .    3.2661772490135474
the cooperation that already exists between surgeons and anesthesiologists makes closer collaboration in the future a logical step .    2.109109419646597
in this review article data of retrospective studies on the therapeutic effects of oxygen are summarized and possible indications for this therapy suggested .    2.451275208359957
studies in infants with chronic lung disease ( cld ) showed that ( i ) if sao2 was kept > = 93 % via generous prescription of home oxygen , rates of sudden death were much lower than in studies where this was less generously prescribed , ( ii ) weight gain was significantly better with o2 therapy than without it , ( iii ) increasing sao2 from 82 to 93 % by providing low - flow oxygen resulted in a 50 % reduction of pulmonary artery pressure , ( iv ) hypoxia could cause a significant increase in airway resistance , and ( v ) low - flow oxygen reduced the frequency of intermittent falls in sao2 to < 85 % even in infants who had values of > = 90 % at rest .    2.102908648824214
these data suggest that oxygen therapy should be considered in cld infants if baseline sao2 is < 93 % .    2.3019593091331636
for older infants , particularly with cf , only few data are available .    2.4754333174048178
in these patients oxygen may only be given if sao2 is < 90 % unless there are clinical symptoms related to hypoxaemia , e . g . pulmonary hypertension .    2.3028438321856215
regarding the practical aspects of home oxygen therapy , provision of liquid oxygen via nasal cannulae appears to be the method of choice .    2.4128248961500893
side effects include the risk of co2 retention , which occurs occasionally in children with cf or sleep - related upper airway obstruction , but has not been reported for infants with cld .    2.601082005132615
to identify this potential side effect and to determine the exact amount of oxygen required , performance of a sleep recording of sao2 and co2 with and without oxygen is suggested .    2.2237941808670545
in infants with cld , home monitoring of oxygenation should also be considered .    2.507985023914595
fractures of the distal radius represent one of the most common fractures and do have high social - economic relevance .    2.599193665076582
for treatement they need practicable classification and therapeutic standards .    2.2809170638182708
the demand for stable osteosynthesis of a3 - , UNK - b3 and c1 - c2 - fractures is connected to dorsal or volar internal fixation with plate and practical autogenous cancellous bone grafting , even for the elder patient .    2.0362673695205555
the isolated external fixation with k - wires represent special situation .    2.2849890268134674
supply of implants and biodegradable materials will support this development .    2.3204595932137453
introduction : pheochromocytoma during pregnancy is rare and represents a high risk for mother and fetus .    2.5760448938329277
due to the variable clinical presentation it may be mistaken for preeclampsia .    2.690561032510992
case : a 34 - year - old UNK with hypertension up to 240 / 120 mmhg .    2.3212692649074516
after diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma its resection together with lymph node metastasis in the 17th week of gestation was performed .    2.465028621268564
conclusion : the definitive diagnosis is confirmed by elevation of serum catecholamines and their metabolites in a 24 - h urine collection .    2.279215090908077
localization during pregnancy can be made by ultrasound and mri .    2.9520858703973647
the definitive treatment is surgical removal after administration of adrenergic blockers .    2.4968783924102627
if discovered later in pregnancy , delivery by elective caesarean section followed by tumor resection is recommended .    2.1701031940183917
ionizing radiation from natural or man - made sources may affect human health .    2.0672694735676793
the main consequence of low and moderate radiation doses is the induction of cancer .    2.3784683277900944
to quantify these effects both epidemiological studies and experimental radiobiological research are needed .    2.1479847886347025
the ensuing results of the studies are used to establish radiation protection principles and dose limits to protect the public from the effects of ionizing radiation .    2.6869064914358267
homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is associated with premature atherosclerosis and early cardiovascular death if untreated .    2.3766239536434925
in an asymptomatic 13 - year - old girl we discovered an extensive hypoplasia of the abdominal aorta and the aa .    2.3978182736619713
UNK , a combination which so far has not been described , that has not been reported before .    2.9069239948303363
the vascular hypoplasia was asymptomatic .    2.649761292794971
angiography additionally showed severe atherosclerosis of the aa .    2.320874509784627
after 13 months of low - density - lipoprotein ( ldl ) - apheresis angiographically there was no UNK , but even slight improvement of vascular the disease .    2.50514393159105
discussion : since severe atheromatous changes of systemic arteries may be missed by clinical examination , we strongly recommend complete imaging of all major systemic arteries in children with homozygous familial hypercholesterinemia .    2.1347849375491244
ldl - apheresis is the treatment of choice in these patients .    3.148798325984083
since 1993 almost 400 patients with port wine stains have been treated with the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser .    2.3097403836234394
the therapeutic effect on 61 adult patients was evaluated .    2.442011831098813
after a mean of 2 . 16 treatments the colour UNK by between 33 % and 100 % in 70 % of these patients .    2.675720195606469
the best results were obtained in patients with plain pink port wine stains .    3.030555977550684
in this kind of port wine stains the argon laser has proved to be far less successful .    2.4075578766035504
the rate of adverse effects amounted to only 5 % .    2.6612627714714154
the results are expected to be improved by further laser sessions .    2.7093111410264594
the flashlamp pumped pulsed dye laser is an important advance in the treatment of port wine stains .    2.7492704032732784
most craniofacial malformations result from a premature fusion of skull sutures .    2.333335883502113
depending on the scope of the sutures affected , the results are more or less distinct deformations of the facial and cranial skull with substantial negative effects on functional as well as esthetic aspects .    2.58260579476316
the etiopathology is still unclear .    2.617979441476616
various therapies have been developed over the past 100 years .    2.9114842013587716
however , UNK ' s technique of fronto - orbital advancement has been an important milestone in the treatment of these malformations .    2.8973620928893054
numerous UNK have since UNK this operational technique .    2.427413122640211
at the same time , these techniques have also aided the UNK in tumor surgery and traumatology .    2.4342097356647603
injuries of the flexor tendon are usually open injuries .    2.5343212917341806
in most cases primary treatment is therefore seldom performed by orthopaedic surgeons .    2.249085303617194
this is different for injuries of the extensor tendon .    2.7558386102234986
therefore we do go into primary and secondary reconstruction of the flexor tendon , but focus on primary and secondary reconstruction of the extensor tendon in the most common zones ( 1 , th i , 3 , th iii ) .    2.4126536031229535
the shouldice operation has evolved to become the classic procedure for open pure tissue repair for inguinal hernias .    2.095005831578604
the operation is an important part of a surgeon ' s repertoire as he may need to perform the procedure at some critical time , especially when faced with strangulation , when tension - free prosthetic repairs and laparoscopic approaches fail .    2.153581755701444
when properly done , the shouldice repair yields results that have set standards for all other techniques to UNK .    2.153361429644543
other particular advantages of the technique are : safety , the use of local anaesthesia , benign postoperative complications and the cost , which is the most reasonable of all surgical techniques .    3.089747744061156
acute occlusive mesenteric ischemia is caused by a local impairment of splanchnic blood flow and poses a particular surgical challenge .    2.4866706069001956
acute superior mesenteric occlusion is a medical / surgical emergency UNK prompt diagnosis ( clinical awareness , angiography ) and therapy ( UNK laparotomy with possible arterial reconstruction ; embolectomy , thrombectomy ; and / or bowel resection ) .    1.9700047461603185
the difficulty of early diagnosis is probably the most important cause of the high mortality which varies from 70 % to 90 % in arterial and functional mesenteric ischemia and from 20 % to 70 % in an acute thrombosis of the mesenteric veins .    2.873158511757336
improved survival from UNK mesenteric ischemia is dependent upon the identification of high - risk groups and on aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures ( intra - arterial infusion of UNK through the angiographic catheter with or without bowel resection ) .    2.5350754804957405
for assessment of bowel viability , the clinical judgement during first - or second - look exploration is still the most reliable parameter .    2.4744493004603867
the surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia includes UNK grafting and UNK endarterectomy in the majority of patients with comorbidity of cardiovascular arteriosclerotic diseases and results in a high rate of symptom - free patients .    2.7408498707590807
prophylactic reconstruction of visceral arteries is indicated only in certain limited circumstances .    2.3381998113057505
thirty - nine of 63 patients undergoing deep anterior rectal resection received a straight coloanal anastomosis ( caa ) ; the remaining 24 patients additionally had a colon - j - pouch ( cpa ) constructed .    1.9658125244104763
after pouch - anal anastomosis , local septic complications occurred in 12 . 5 % of patients compared to 20 . 5 % after coloanal anastomosis .    3.051675905973427
stool frequency after pouch - anal anastomosis was 3 . 3 per 24 h compared to 5 . 2 per 24 h after straight anastomosis within the first year after ileostomy closure ( p = 0 . 053 ) .    2.502948854572321
continence was slightly better in the pouch group ( n . s . ) , and anal manometry showed a significant postoperative decrease only in resting pressure after straight coloanal anastomosis ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    2.4450669590032046
this study supports the construction of a colon - j - pouch after deep rectal resection , as the pouch - anal anastomosis has fewer local septic complications and seems to improve functional outcome .    2.1749236355833723
the introduction of flow - directed pulmonary artery ( pa ) catheters has helped to improve our knowledge of cardiovascular physiology .    2.2164165967558467
there have been several developments of this equipment in recent years , including continuous monitoring of mixed - venous o2 saturation ( sv \ = o2 ) and cardiac output ( co ) .    2.0949196835626545
the high UNK price , however , is an obstacle to its use in the critically ill .    2.9792554409247876
the aim of the present study was to analyse the actual costs of these devices in comparison to UNK used intermittent monitoring of sv \ = o2 and co .    2.1597646091196245
purpose : persistent hypotony with UNK - UNK is a severe complication of mitomycin c when used during filtration surgery .    2.6951580277954093
we wanted to know whether this complication can be controlled by a surgical reintervention yielding tight closure of the initial UNK .    2.499923802104527
the detection of cytokines may elucidate the pathophysiological mechanisms that produce early systemic complications in acute interstitial ( i ) or necrotizing ( n ) pancreatitis ( ap ) .    2.1370307755586624
the increase in the level of cytokines in the blood of patients with ap may correlate with the severity of the disease .    3.599722989862065
in a prospective clinical trial from october 1992 to august 1993 , 23 patients with ap were recruited and blood samples taken for cytokine detection by commercially available elisa kits and c - reactive protein ( crp ) by laser UNK .    1.935031138184165
six of 11 patients with nap died either early ( n = 1 ) or of late septic complications .    2.735616517076178
the peak of cytokine and crp level in the first 3 days of hospitalization was used for calculation .    2.721970557862502
the il - 6 concentration in the blood reached up to UNK pg / ml in the 1st few days , depending on the severity of ap , and dropped to almost zero in the next days , independently of the clinical course .    2.441597560888696
the blood levels of il - 8 reached a maximum of UNK pg / ml in the 1st few days , depending on the severity of ap , and showed a correlation with the clinical course in the following days .    2.627575301289424
the peak of il - 8 blood levels indicated correctly the severity of ap in 18 out of 23 patients using a cutoff level of 200 pg / ml ( accuracy : 78 % , se : 82 % , sp : 75 % , p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.099199478245359
the crp levels increased up to a maximum of 535 mg / l and indicated the course of ap correctly in 18 out of 22 patients ( se and sp 82 % , p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.270699764405072
there was no correlation between cytokine blood levels and mortality .    2.335188119589209
in the blood samples of five patients with i - or nap , no tnf - was detectable .    2.4571675464763314
the blood levels of il - 6 , and to a lesser extent of il - 8 and crp , can predict the severity and early systemic complications of ap .    2.7223566204605905
the excessive rise in cytokines can be explained by the stimulation of immunological cells ( macrophages , lymphocytes and endothelial cells ) in the course of ap , inducing early systemic complications .    2.464253453599086
the surface area and the UNK of bone regeneration materials influence their chemical and biological properties .    2.917239814765825
therefore , the size of the specific surface area and the distribution of the pore diameters ( pores < 1 µm ) of bone regeneration materials were analyzed within this study .    2.3033157993822506
the analyzed UNK were of synthetic , bovine , and UNK origin .    2.700696273205803
the UNK phosphates and the UNK included only synthetic materials .    2.774391091518918
the gas UNK of each specimen was analyzed using a volumetric n2 / UNK system ( UNK UNK , UNK ) .    2.7652711324313177
additionally , for materials with a specific surface area ( > 2 m2 / g ) the pore size distribution was evaluated by the UNK - method .    2.870845424355395
two of the materials evaluated UNK large dimensions of the specific surface area ( biooss 79 . 7 m2 / g , algipore new 14 . 6 m2 / g ) .    2.2041972734325035
a medium surface area was found for algipore old ( 4 . 9 m2 / g ) and interpore200 ( 2 . 64 m2 / g ) .    2.634069172443502
all other included materials showed only small sizes of the specific surface area ( ceros80 1 . 8 m2 / g , ceros82 1 . 31 m2 / g , cerasorb 1 . 2 m2 / g , biobase 0 . 7 m2 / g , endobone 0 . 7 m2 / g , perioglas 0 . 6 m2 / g , UNK 0 . 23 m2 / g , biogran 0 . 2 m2 / g ) .    2.279622330200725
the materials with large and medium sizes of the specific surface area evaluated the following pore diameters : biooss 2 - 50 nm , algipore new 2 - 100 nm , algipore old 5 - 50 nm , interpore200 2 - 100 nm .    1.9053191632351059
pore sizes less than 2 nm were not found in relevant numbers .    2.5552556129130917
the materials biooss , old and new algipore , and interpore200 contain a large interconnecting UNK system ( diameter < 1 µm ) .    2.0067706490149715
for the materials biobase , endobone , perioglas , UNK 50 , and biogran this cannot be assumed .    1.9561807423912105
the materials ceros80 , ceros82 , and cerasorb evaluated a specific surface area between those and might include only a small part of these interconnecting pores .    2.0277589397821383
an influence of the interconnecting porosity and the different sizes of the specific surface areas on the biological behavior of the bone regeneration materials can be suggested .    2.538145163189661
the literature on the psychosocial aspects of head and neck cancer surgery from 1950 to 1995 was reviewed in four parts .    1.8801772766107194
in the present part 4 ten possibly useful targets for future research are formulated : .    2.097181216165814
radiotherapy unequivocally has to be regarded as standard therapy in stage i and iia / b testicular UNK .    2.750264514325015
using low dose abdominal irradiation tumour control rates of 95 - 98 % in stage i disease and 80 - 95 % in stage iia / b can be achieved .    2.194112880353372
disease specific survival reaches 100 % .    2.4746993703022166
likewise , radiotherapy is treatment of first choice in case of testicular intraepithelial neoplasia ( tin ) in a solitary testis or in case of a double - sided tin yielding safe eradication of the in - situ carcinoma of the testis .    2.597864932134126
objectives of further clinical research in radiotherapy of testicular malignancies aim at reduction of treatment intensity in order to minimize acute and late side effects of irradiation without compromising tumour control rates .    2.3688855259135377
a forty year old healthy adult man was admitted to our out - patient department because of a highly UNK rheumatoid factor .    2.5392386643418976
since the person was planning an extended stay in africa , we performed an extensive history , clinical and laboratory examination to rule out UNK inflammatory diseases .    2.3247769688425444
possible explanations for an elevated rheumatoid factor including the genetic risk factors are discussed .    2.3168159088833638
a multifactorial etiology UNK the majority of cases of alzheimer ' s disease ( ad ) .    2.7140148192459668
both ill - defined environmental and genetic factors contribute to the development of the disease .    2.891659126846968
allele 4 of UNK is a genetic risk factor .    3.231610134437328
its presence increases the risk of developing ad .    3.2400951051787366
however , presence of UNK is neither necessary nor sufficient for the disease to arise .    2.771311524611976
apart from the common multifactorial forms of the disease , there are rare variants which are inherited as mendelian traits .    2.6085457432906893
to date three genes are known that can be mutated in these rare forms of ad .    2.3604891493082456
of these , mutations in the gene presenilin 1 on chromosome 14 are most frequent .    2.3447859314332598
this article reviews our present knowledge of the genetics of ad and discusses its relevance for patients with ad and their relatives .    2.581808547620846
in recent years female psychoanalysts provided fertile approaches to an understanding of the mother - daughter - relationship with the conceptions of the ' UNK complex ' ( UNK - UNK ) , the ' symbiotic UNK ' ( UNK - freud ) , the ' higher permeability of the ego - boundaries ' ( UNK - UNK ) , and the ' conflict of separation - UNK which has to be resolved again and again throughout life ' ( UNK ) .    2.59511934237326
in the light of these conceptions it is UNK that in analyses with both participants being of equal gender ( female - female UNK ) a specific intensity and quality of female aggression may manifest itself when certain threshold situations of the pre - UNK mother - daughter - relationship are UNK .    1.967042769689134
case UNK and a UNK example illustrate the risks as well as possible resolutions UNK by these early relationship dynamics , as these are reactivated in the here and now of the analyst ' s relationship towards her patient .    2.1944134820529104
there has been a marked increase in the incidence of pelvic fractures over the last few years .    3.0957348295956715
associated injuries to the urogenital and vascular system as well as nerve injuries worsen the prognosis .    2.935020063570225
over a five year period 126 patients with severe pelvic trauma were treated .    2.5192510885166355
out of these 39 ( 30 . 9 % ) sustained additional UNK injuries and represent the study sample .    2.6670781774620833
type b injuries according to the ao classification occurred in 16 ( 41 % ) patients , type c fractures in 23 ( 59 % ) patients .    2.6947397281049468
the spleen , liver and kidney were the most frequently injured organs ( 58 . 9 % ) , followed by urogenital lesions ( 46 . 6 % ) , nerve injuries ( 25 . 6 % ) and vascular lesions ( 15 . 3 % ) .    3.009530717269428
the most common UNK lesions were thoracic injuries in 56 . 4 % and severe head injuries ( gcs < 8 ) in 33 . 3 % .    2.4956134352083597
the mean hannover UNK was 35 . 6 points , the mean injury severity score 27 . 6 points .    2.5964335928429434
UNK was performed in 21 pelvic ring fractures ( 53 % ) , eight procedures ( 50 % ) in type b fractures and 13 ( 56 % ) in type c fractures .    3.104106870758805
in type b injuries the anterior pelvic ring was stabilized with a tension band wiring in four cases , in two patients with an external fixator and with plate osteosynthesis in one case .    2.9378940041229105
in type c injuries the external fixator was applied as the only stabilizing procedure in six patients .    2.5938788381932896
in four cases the anterior ring was fixed with tension band wiring or plates and the dorsal aspect of the pelvic ring with sacral UNK .    2.252253888632397
three patients had their additional acetabular fracture UNK through a anterior approach .    2.287889323541401
all surviving 28 patients were followed up for an average of 18 months ( range 7 - 59 months ) after the trauma .    2.8755108005014964
the patients were classified using the pelvic outcome score proposed by the german society of trauma surgery .    2.4899382185354884
53 . 4 % of the type b fractures showed a good clinical outcome , 47 . 6 % a poor outcome .    3.4703662383791287
15 . 4 % with type c fractures presented with a good outcome , 84 . 6 % with a poor outcome .    3.48248711576475
80 % of the type b and 23 % of the type c fractures had a good radiological outcome .    3.275832781323469
20 % of type b and 77 % of type c injuries had a poor radiological outcome .    2.9179660511968075
five patients ( 12 . 8 % ) sustained persistent urological symptoms .    3.1794450872701936
three of these had urinary dysfunction , two used permanent UNK due to their severe UNK deficit after a head injury .    2.3052821861096167
ten patients with nerve injuries at the time of trauma suffered long term neurological dysfunction of the lumbosacral plexus .    2.5004486670847395
the mortality rate was 28 % .    2.8776081887868266
seven patients died in the emergency room due to uncontrollable bleeding , four in the intensive care unit from multi - organ failure .    2.302904808035232
the management of complex pelvic trauma consists of fracture treatment and interdisciplinary treatment of the associated injury .    2.5871888282684306
lesions of the abdominal organs or of major vessels must be addressed first if hemodynamic instability is present .    2.366289073524944
injuries to smaller vessels can be embolized percutaneously .    2.34463377908044
urinary bladder ruptures are treated as an emergency , urethral lesions electively after four to six weeks . we recommend external fixation of the pelvis in the acute phase for control of both the osseous instability and control of haemorrhage through external compression .    2.4297503995483676
the treatment of choice for the anterior pelvic ring is tension band wiring or plating .    2.5145338275685782
if this is contraindicated due to an open fracture external fixation is the treatment of choice .    2.8073256602457364
type c fractures require posterior ring stabilization which should be postponed until four days post admission .    2.3050335039267114
dysfunction of serotonergic neurotransmission has been associated with two different psychopathological syndromes - UNK UNK resulting form a lack of stimulation of the " behavior inhibition system " on the one hand and the manifestation of clinical depression and compulsive syndromes on the other .    2.470585761716318
the examination of primate behavior provides a model which may UNK these seemingly contradictory hypotheses .    2.2218409632647678
according to primate experiments , UNK depletion results in anxious and UNK behavior only if the individual has previously been exposed to social isolation stress , which in turn induces a decrease in the central serotonin turnover rate .    2.1341157008738723
young non - human primates who experience early social separation stress are anxious and UNK , while as adults they tend to be aggressive , UNK excessive amounts of alcohol and are less UNK by alcohol intake .    2.1459928261799774
these observation indicate the importance of social separation stress in the pathogenesis of alcoholism and antisocial behavior and may point to prophylactic and pharmacological treatment strategies .    2.3977446790167454
the implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses ( pcl ) leads to greater trauma to the eye than UNK pcl implantation .    2.1115286408196066
persistent breakdown of the blood - aqueous barrier might impair the postoperative long - term prognosis .    2.545231635517517
using laser - UNK , we quantified the disorder of the barrier function during the early postoperative phase and in the long - term postoperative course for both surgical procedures .    3.0378207722061057
during the first 3 postoperative days , flare values were three times higher in the group with transsclerally sutured pcl than in the conventional pcl group .    2.7042560365951176
cell counts after transscleral suture fixation ( 27 . 7 + / - 18 . 3 / 0 . UNK mm3 ) decreased slightly during the first 5 postoperative days .    2.6012615930562473
in contrast , the conventional pcl group regained the preoperative level ( 2 . 5 + / - 5 . 1 ) after 3 days .    2.923598239137899
after 3 months , no significant differences in flare values and cell counts were seen between the two groups .    2.5683085231101432
after implantation of transsclerally sutured posterior chamber lenses , breakdown of the blood - aqueous barrier was initially more pronounced than in conventional pcl implantation .    2.078007321814152
however , the barrier function was re - established equally in both groups in the long term .    2.546825793624979
no signs of a persistent disorder of the barrier were found .    2.9942339757027545
there is clear evidence for obstructive sleep apnea as an independent cause of arterial hypertension .    2.3989248407023434
we report a case of intracranial hemorrhage with systemic hypertension resistant to antihypertensive medication , which could only be adjusted after effective treatment of coexisting sleep - disordered breathing .    2.2105533283683227
the 36 year old male ( body mass index 31 kg / m2 ) was admitted to hospital three weeks before for intracranial bleeding at the left external capsule .    2.1800993093739263
diagnosis of primary hypertension was made after extensive work - up in the acute hospital .    3.18230508406344
blood pressure was adjusted with five - fold antihypertensive medication at the time of admission to neurological rehabilitation , but was still elevated with " non - dipping " as determined by long - term measurement despite medications above the recommended dosages .    2.2807926569963457
10 days after initiation of treatment with nasal cpap blood pressure control was easier with normal dipping at night .    2.2804427548665553
medication could be reduced during rehabilitation with further reduction after discharge .    2.4832855322846936
moderate obstructive sleep apnea appears to be the cause of severe hypertension resistant to pharmacological therapy in this patient .    2.9454241585100016
the case underlines the impact of diagnosis and treatment of sleep - disordered breathing for the secondary prevention of stroke .    2.907471322942793
the possibility of a specific origin of joint infection should be considered in finding the diagnosis .    2.824425936658287
this is demonstrated in a case of tuberculosis of the hip treated in the dept .    3.2419712466131054
of trauma surgery in collaboration with the medical dept .    2.8997662756676283
microbiological and imaging examinations are essential to plan and perform a combined therapy of hip arthroplasty and concomittant medical antituberculous therapy .    2.234219501517523
in accordance to a literature review , this procedure proved successful for both eliminating the local infection and the functional outcome of the operation .    2.625873740210749
the purpose of our studies was to investigate experimentally the dose - dependent effects of extracorporeal shock waves on tendon and bone and to UNK therapeutic possibilities in UNK and pseudarthroses .    2.5170373451573615
from january 1994 to january 1996 , 18 patients underwent vitrectomy as a result of endophthalmitis .    2.5263829927711123
the aim of this retrospective study was to analyze the visual outcome of surgical treatment .    2.7051478763116075
tracheostomy is considered the airway management of choice in long - term ventilated icu patients .    3.0253354704180446
in the last few years , percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy ( pdt ) has been established as an attractive and safe alternative to conventional open tracheostomy .    2.5587181989868606
recently , there is another percutaneous technique according to UNK with UNK airway access ( tlt ) available .    2.832358250976297
our study seeks to evaluate tlt in terms of complications and practicability .    2.6883922424756483
in 47 patients of our surgical icu , elective tlt was performed .    2.3866608189783833
mean operative time was 9 . 8 + / - 10 . 9 ( range 6 - 27 ) minutes .    2.7622334375156536
severe complications , such as bleeding , aspiration or infection of the UNK have never been noted .    3.4415209853424376
a slight detoriation of arterial oxygen tension occured in 25 patients intraoperatively , demanding to rise the concentration of inspired oxygen temporarily .    2.107014774337218
however , no patient became hypoxic during the procedure . since during the procedure gas exchange may worsen , tlt should not be employed in patients whose inspired oxygen concentration exceeds 80 % .    2.1856217698596376
despite the fact that severe complications associated with tlt have recently not yet been reported , physicians who perform tlt should be well - trained in the technique of conventional open tracheostomy , too .    2.3052534630849415
according to our present data , tlt seems to be an attractive and safe alternative to pdt .    2.589508601852028
nevertheless , for a UNK evaluation of tlt , further investigations in larger groups of patients and in the long term seem to be necessary .    3.303848212119835
there are no direct associations between testosterone levels and sexual function in the aging male .    2.440641230058532
a study of 169 patients focusing on the relations of hormone levels and sexual dysfunction did not reveal associations between testosterone levels and the risk of altered sexual functions .    2.383588891850654
in volunteers , in whom a hypogonadism was generated by the application of gnrh , no alteration in sexual reactions occurred .    2.381650848247336
it is possible that other testosterone fractions are more UNK than the total testosterone .    2.268417537400031
however , all the known fractions correlate closely .    2.4984493431775556
the significance of a normal testosterone level for a normal erection has been rarely considered up to now .    2.5639649964770332
in an animal experiment , the intracavernous pressure , the density of - receptors , and the UNK activity depended on normal testosterone levels .    2.556712921550573
it is not known whether different testosterone levels influence the effectiveness of treatment procedures for erectile dysfunction in humans .    2.3931886518629777
in a 65 years old male patient 38 cc of a 7 . 45 % potassium chloride - solution was inadvertently infused within 3 hours into an epidural catheter on the first postoperative day .    2.1454835635295493
furthermore vegetative symptoms like hypertension and tachycardia were observed .    2.1934468525269604
about 6 hours after the start of infusion all symptoms had disappeared .    2.4442028637201543
it is proposed that the use of colour - coded epidural catheter devices and UNK electrolyte solutions as well as infusion - pumps with a larger reservoir that reduce the frequency of syringe changes would be helpful in avoiding such complications .    2.4743071003128514
this paper reviews respiratory muscle / circulation interaction in congestive heart failure .    2.0541839344073725
respiratory muscle dysfunction consisting of both reduced pressure - UNK capacity and reduced endurance is well documented in these patients .    2.145023063544723
the mechanisms underlying its development and the potential consequences especially in the development of dyspnea are then presented .    2.917189598505154
not only are respiratory muscles dysfunctioning in these patients , but under specific circumstances they can impede the circulation , such as during weaning from mechanical ventilation .    2.431717728112126
the underlying pathophysiology and the theoretical model explaining this interesting interaction is finally discussed .    2.0733013452777036
traumatic , perilunate dislocations are rare lesions , and one third of them are associated with perilunate dislocation fractures .    2.7055935435847145
unfortunately , one quarter of all such fractures go unrecognized , although conventional x - rays can allow their diagnosis in as many as 48 % of cases , which can be improved by performing ct or bone scan in addition to 62 % and 95 % , UNK .    2.493087498337244
forced extension seems to be the most frequent trauma mechanism .    3.3826897318791733
the treatment consists of open reduction , predominantly of the lunate bone , and internal fixation .    2.757373931602062
huge carpal fragments such as the scaphoid and UNK are ideally fixed by means of compression screws , while smaller fragments can only be aligned with kirschner wires .    2.6497150899619086
osteochondral chips are best reinserted into the bone by means of anchoring systems .    2.5156000319192873
in cases of complex carpal instability supplementary stabilization may be achieved with an external fixator .    2.533361046546205
the best results on the martini evaluation score were achieved in simple perilunate dislocations that were reset early by open surgical procedures and were accompanied by minimal involvement of / damage to different tissues .    1.9395348120225409
although we had a nonunion rate of approximately 20 % in our series of 11 mixed traumatized patients in all , the martini classification of hand function seems to be a reliable score system for practical clinical follow - ups .    2.427066700926862
maternal anxiety in the event of a false positive result is an argument against universal hearing screening in newborns .    2.1078524037911492
the aim of this study was to investigate the mothers ' attitudes towards neonatal hearing screening and their anxiety in case of a positive result .    2.3525270938211778
interleukin - 2 ( il - 2 ) and interferon - ( ifn - ) were both administered subcutaneously ( sc ) in combination with intravenously ( iv ) applied 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) for the treatment of patients with UNK renal cell carcinoma ( rcc ) .    2.856013177769176
the therapy protocol consisted of a treatment cycle of 8 weeks , which could be carried out in an outpatient regimen .    2.742560940629392
the ifn - was given in each of the 8 weeks ( 6 - 9 mu / m2 once to three times weekly sc ) combined sequentially with il - 2 ( 5 - 20 mu / m2 three times weekly sc for 4 weeks ) and 5 - fu ( 750 mg / m2 iv weekly for 4 weeks ) .    2.4992987322716216
among the 30 consecutive patients treated , in 2 cases a complete , and in 9 cases a partial , remission was achieved in patients with mostly lung and skeletal metastases , with an overall objective response rate of 37 % .    2.6048849402315652
mean response duration was 8 months ( range 3 - 18 months ) .    2.685765773704656
a stable state of the disease lasting 3 - 18 months was observed in 10 cases .    3.504944424555155
the side effects were only slight and corresponded to toxicity grade i ( n = 2 ) , grade ii ( n = 22 ) and grade iii ( n = 6 ) , according to the who classification .    3.0057099787666193
in conclusion , this triple - drug UNK demonstrated significant clinical effectiveness comparable with that of an aggressive il - 2 treatment regimen ( applied iv ) , but without its high toxicity .    2.2429234339553403
compression therapy was employed for 4 weeks 20 patients with chronic venous insufficiency stage cvi i and cvi ii according to widmer ' s classification .    2.598644537928739
compression bandaging for 2 weeks was followed by compression stockings for 2 more weeks .    2.181390766043269
the cutaneous microcirculation was evaluated before therapy , after 2 weeks and after finishing compression therapy after 4 weeks .    2.2314659147176217
marked improvement in symptoms such as pain and itching was observed after 4 weeks , along with a significant reduction in lower limb volume .    2.5736233242743025
video capillary microscopy revealed an increase in capillary density associated with a decrease in capillary diameter and UNK halo diameter .    2.707275943140532
compression treatment achieves at least part of its effect by improving the function of the skin microcirculation .    2.7892229940638025
the efficacy of bandaging and stockings was similar .    2.3839095332998204
the splanchnic perfusion is reduced early in the course of any shock .    2.715315813283712
the mucosa of the gut suffers most as it experiences a high oxygen demand even in the steady state .    2.220732193423602
the specific arrangement of the micro vessels within the villus of the mucosa exposes the tip of the villus at the highest risk for ischemia , particularly in low flow states .    2.1367124586170596
as a consequence the integrity of the mucosal layer is compromised and dysfunction of the mucosal barrier may allow bacteria and UNK to UNK from the gut lumen .    2.579002285805652
activation of leukocytes and stimulation of cytokine synthesis may comprise a sustained inflammatory response syndrome .    2.195851452177897
so far there is a good body of evidence that the splanchnic region may play an important role in the pathophysiological sequence from shock to organ dysfunction .    2.5402957610985104
as pacing impedance is inversely related to pacing current , the increase of pacing impedance additionally decreases pacing current .    2.1739941999590338
whether the impedance measurement at implantation predicts the outcome during follow - up , was studied in 87 patients who received the vdd - single lead UNK 425 connected to the pacemaker unity ( UNK intermedics ) .    2.093386916875536
the impedance changes between implantation and 6 months follow - up were assessed for each patient .    2.7393256987264323
similar impedance values were defined , if the two measurements were within a range < = - 100 to + 100 .    2.3236061048289676
six - months impedance was lower or higher compared to implantation , if the difference exceeded > - 100 or > + 100 .    2.138029279946049
at implantation , impedance was 535 + / - 98 ( range : UNK - UNK ) and significantly increased to 604 + / - 160 ( range : 361 - UNK ) after 6 months .    3.2844159609554264
mean difference between the two measurements was 69 + / - 162 ( range : - UNK UNK + UNK ) .    3.0643580154634047
similar impedance had 43 ( implantation : UNK + / - 75 , 6 months : 531 + / - 87 ) , lower values 11 ( implantation : 660 + / - 83 , 6 months : UNK + / - 73 ) and higher values 33 patients ( implantation : UNK + / - 99 , 6 months : UNK + / - 168 ) .    2.5028395316740806
compared to the patients with similar impedance patients with lower impedance had a significantly higher impedance values at implantation .    2.837948749503717
conclusions : pacing impedance increased significantly within 6 months after implantation .    2.4444908847146416
pacing impedance changed > 100 in 51 % of the patients .    2.512146892795529
the long - term follow - up of pacing impedance can be predicted generally , but not for the individual patient .    2.7215810240896876
endothelin has both vasoconstrictor and mitogenic properties and might , therefore , play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes and coronary atherosclerosis .    2.466647942155367
the aim of the study was to characterize the mechanisms and kinetics of cardiac endothelin - 1 ( et - 1 ) release following a local endothelial injury during ptca ( group a ) and after sustained myocardial ischemia ( group b ) .    2.2949955345052127
additionally , the precision of agreement between measurements in coronary sinus and peripheral venous samples should be analyzed .    2.126390649806304
since first described in the early 1990s , coronary magnetic resonance angiography ( mra ) has evolved as a promising noninvasive modality for imaging of the coronary arteries and evaluation of coronary artery disease .    2.6085456566092504
despite technical limitations , coronary mra has established value for imaging of anomalous coronary artery and assessment of bypass graft patency .    2.274486034095224
current research focuses on the development of optimal respiratory compensation strategies , improved spatial and temporal resolution and faster acquisition of image data .    2.4653044670182975
the accurate detection of stenoses and assessment of the severity of coronary atherosclerosis is presently being evaluated with large multicenter studies .    2.67204616747903
with further technique UNK and more clinical experience , coronary mra is likely to become the dominant noninvasive modality in clinical cardiology .    2.245233029937123
which consequences can be ascribed to the intraarticular position of devices in the operative treatment of a slipped capital femoral epiphysis ?    2.3262540383711627
which steps are to define as a standard of a careful procedure ?    2.6029258274297136
a digitised three - dimensional ( 3 - d ) image of the face has many valuable uses .    2.9384285951110574
these include accurate measurements of facial morphology , clinical documentation and objective analyses of surgical procedures .    2.161965701450248
a new system presented here , based on UNK techniques , instantaneously UNK digitised images using high - resolution cameras .    2.5199210771815164
it has an accuracy of more than 0 . 5 mm rms and creates the 3 - d image from approximately 20 , 000 points .    2.624961649375878
the principles of the image capturing are demonstrated and the potential uses discussed .    2.4112036377823407
surgical changes of the soft tissue in two patients following orthognathic surgery are also illustrated .    3.123339072464085
this new capturing and measurement system provides a simple method of determining 3 - d changes in soft tissue following surgery and is a useful tool for clinical purposes .    2.358448456249574
a potential impact of tricyclic antidepressants on oral anticoagulation is controversial .    2.1668437446437547
phenprocoumon - the most commonly used anticoagulant in germany - is rarely considered in clinical trials .    2.399915859304605
in the present study , a potential drug - drug interaction between phenprocoumon and UNK , causing an alteration in UNK effects , has been investigated .    2.6080546579332644
to analyse the possible injuries of vertebral segments , especially the disc , after unstable thoracolumbar fractures stabilised with ao internal fixator , we performed magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) of the UNK region after implant removal .    2.6739821123165317
there were two aspects of disc degeneration ( dd ) : ( 1 ) biochemical changes and ( 2 ) structural damage .    2.4994859273320094
mri detects biochemical processes as one aspect of dd that is often small even in the presence of greater structural damage of the nucleus pulposus caused by fracture .    2.32056865529587
none of the patients presented with structural failure of the anulus fibrosus , which is the essential structural component of the vertebral segments with regard to stability .    3.1203164533180856
we observed biochemical changes more often in the lower of the two fracture - adjacent discs and alterations of UNK shape more often in the upper of the two , whereas loss of height concerned both discs to approximately the same degree .    2.468542153642004
the UNK of upper - disc resection in thoracolumbar fractures justify their procedure among other things with the structural disc damage , such as alteration of shape and loss of height ( altogether more frequent in the upper disc ) .    2.2360301821628874
our observations that a disc with a structurally altered nucleus pulposus can be biochemically intact and can show an intact anulus fibrosus are arguments in favour of disc preservation .    1.8715638623933886
with regard to the upper disc , the widespread opinion that complete and regular disc damage requires a resection has to be revised .    2.519961696811539
the question of whether the lower disc should be resected more often because of its greater biochemical changes cannot be answered by the present study alone .    2.5386742098748503
besides the excellent static information in all anatomical structures of the vertebral column available by mri , a repeat examination in a prone position yields dynamic information on the spinal cord in the case of suspected dorsal adhesions .    2.4078728432630223
to study the frequency and clinical aspects of cold urticaria in central europe , patient data from a university dermatology clinic and a private dermatology office between 1984 - 94 were analysed and the patients reexamined if possible .    2.22102083018035
the incidence of cold urticaria was found to be 0 . 05 % .    3.3250878478768073
of the 56 patients with cold urticaria ( 31 women , 25 men ) , 49 had idiopathic cold urticaria .    2.0840988492757915
the mean age was 41 . 0 + / - 15 . 6 year , the mean duration of disease 7 . 9 + / - 5 . 8 years .    3.1998402287843954
atopy was found in 46 . 5 % of patients , and 23 . 2 % of the patients suffered from other types of urticaria ( cholinergic , chronic idiopathic , UNK , UNK and heat - induced ) .    3.361827987880693
laboratory examinations were only rarely abnormal .    2.6478393552116612
44 patients were treated with antihistamines , with generally only moderate symptomatic improvement .    2.7748828208454346
treatment with antibiotics ( penicillin , 1 - 2 UNK iu / d over 2 - 4 weeks , n = 18 , or UNK , 2 g / d over 2 weeks , n = 10 ) induced full remission in 13 patients and symptomatic improvement in 8 .    2.71652356905581
during an average of 6 . 5 year - follow - up , 20 of 43 symptomatic patients went into spontaneous remission .    2.7069048077488596
background : since its first implantation as an UNK replacement in the united states in 1985 , hydroxyapatite has been rarely used as an orbital implant in germany .    2.229731972981748
the aim of the study was to collect data on long - term tolerance , postoperative complications and the cosmetic end results .    2.5062933128226454
a 37 - year - old woman had intensive care for 105 days and artificial ventilation for 72 days because of a lung transplantation and multiple postoperative complications .    2.300093902943671
she developed severe heterotopic ossification of both shoulders , the right elbow and both hip joints .    2.181872099499314
owing to complete joint stiffness , she was immobilized and unable to UNK or UNK without help .    2.556990357628194
operative treatment was performed in two procedures .    3.071807324912672
the right shoulder and right elbow were operated on first ; the right hip and later the left hip were operated on after recovery from the previous surgical procedures .    2.279886432420282
after 22 months , there was a good functional result ; the patient took part in all activities of daily life and was pain - free .    2.5463138488253825
the present knowledge on heterotopic ossifications is summarized , as well as possible prophylactic measurements .    2.5383634237125494
background : atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ( avnrt ) is one of the most common forms of supraventricular tachycardia in the pediatric population .    2.2751866605908044
patients and methods : 41 children with a mean age of 9 . 6 ( 3 . 7 - 16 ) years with recurrent atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia ( avnrt ) refractory to medical treatment ( n = 38 ) and recurrent syncope ( n = 3 ) underwent electrophysiologic ( ep ) study .    2.6146101147920615
in all patients dual av - nodal physiology could be demonstrated during ep study and typical form of avnrt ( mean heart rate 220 / min ) could be induced by programmed atrial stimulation .    2.215182087155288
a UNK 7 f ablation catheter was placed at the UNK region of the UNK valve annulus close to the UNK of the coronary sinus with the intention to record a late fractionated local atrial UNK during sinus rhythm .    3.113326487110585
starting at this point radiofrequency current ( 500 khz ) with a target temperature of 70 °c was delivered with the intention to ablate the slow pathway .    2.2823848444972987
if a slowly accelerated junctional rhythm ( < 120 / min ) occurred during energy discharge , programmed atrial stimulation was repeated .    2.1177890084132382
otherwise radiofrequency current was delivered step by step up to a septal position next to the tricuspid valve annulus .    2.1369066275516913
slow pathway modulation was defined as maximal one atrial UNK after ablation .    2.499082740529345
results : the number of energy applications ranged from 1 - 19 ( median 6 ) .    2.638340394668335
in 35 / 41 patients slow pathway ablation could be achieved ; in six patients the slow pathway was modulated .    2.2702040569590443
in none of the patients permanent high grade av block was observed .    2.786869130031966
during follow - up ( mean 4 . 1 years ) two patients had a recurrent episode of avnrt after slow pathway modulation .    2.7724339175876653
all other patients are still free of avnrt without medical treatment .    2.4806440326784194
conclusion : selective radiofrequency current ablation / modulation of the slow pathway is a safe and curative treatment of avnrt in young patients .    2.1824245603925405
since we had the impression that there was an increase in blood loss during mammaplasties after a change in the anesthesiology department responsible , we conducted a study to compare 28 cases from each anesthesiology department .    2.475734696164429
all operations were carried out by the first author in succession using the same operative technique .    2.6468407862914356
the two groups did not differ in age , bmi , operative time , weight of resected tissue or preoperative laboratory .    2.417345883145234
blood loss was calculated from the perioperative drop in hemoglobin and patient ' s blood volume .    2.626048878600197
blood pressure , heart rate , medication and intravenous fluid supply were obtained from the anesthetic protocols .    2.6535557630113202
results ( means and standard deviations ) : group i ( n = 28 ) and [ group ii ( n = 28 ) ] : total resected tissue UNK + / - UNK g [ UNK + / - UNK g ] ; hb - preop .    2.517035845708802
13 . 6 + / - 0 . 9 g / dl [ 13 . 8 + / - 0 . 8 g / dl ] ; hb - postop .    2.9423363246752423
10 . 8 + / - 1 . 3 g / dl [ 9 . 7 + / - 1 . 3 g / dl ] p = 0 . 006 ; blood loss UNK + / - 339 ml [ UNK + / - UNK ml ] p < 0 . 001 .    2.8349874732773306
after exclusion of surgical or biological causes hemodynamic effects of the anesthetic techniques were suspected as the reason for the significant difference in blood loss .    2.612055419766734
map was elevated only initially , while the heart rate was considerably elevated throughout the procedures in group ii .    2.7388952385715473
during anesthesia with nitrous oxide and enflurane , the dose of enflurane in group i could be limited to 0 . 3 - 0 . 5 % after initial i . v . administration of 60 to 100 µg sufentanil , while in group ii without opioids doses of 0 . 5 - 2 % were required .    2.9579851232286565
the well - known dose - dependend effect of enflurane on the peripheral vascular tone was not UNK by UNK at the operative site .    2.552741753843165
conclusions : blood loss during mammaplasties can be affected considerably by the anaesthetic technique - even without deliberate hypotension .    2.0529238495567865
sufentanil can indirectly reduce the blood loss by lowering the necessary dose of enflurane .    2.424793253920752
blood transfusions can be avoided at mammaplasties .    2.7254690586228745
continuous epidural infusion of bupivacaine with the opioid fentanyl represents an effective analgesic method in the therapy of strong postoperative pain after major surgery .    2.4345680405918153
preparation of the required infusion solution in UNK with a volume of 50 ml immediately prior to administration is routinely performed by nursing staff in germany .    2.3485836016861192
the effort required for the preparation is associated with logistical and pharmaceutical difficulties .    2.559313902778965
the preparation of a mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0 . 06 % and fentanyl 0 . 0002 % in 250 ml infusion UNK at the UNK of the university hospital mainz is described .    2.518106021283205
to determine the physicochemical stability , the concentration of bupivacaine - hcl and fentanyl was assessed using hplc over a period of 32 days ; in addition the ph values were determined .    2.4136996418057586
after 32 days 95 % of the bupivacaine hydrochloride and fentanyl baseline values were recorded .    2.6170999463940596
the ph baseline value had decreased from 5 . 48 - 5 . 52 to 0 . 5 - 0 . 7 units .    2.901031336934701
the measured values confirm the physicochemical stability of the mixture of bupivacaine hydrochloride 0 . 06 % and fentanyl 0 . 0002 % over a period of 32 days .    2.1054310233327747
the infusion bag can be stored for 4 weeks at room temperature .    2.3689858404904727
the programming of a cochlear implant speech processor used by young children is often difficult , especially when the stimulus level associated with maximum auditory UNK ( mal ) needs to be determined .    2.2108750687090164
excessively high stimulation should be avoided as this can have a traumatic effect .    2.586371021585612
the aim of this study was to determine if a relationship exists between the intraoperatively determined electrical stapedius reflex threshold ( esrt ) and the postoperatively determined mal and hearing threshold for 27 patients , each having one of three implant types .    1.9046320372798717
the question of whether the esrt provides a practical technique to simplify , improve and accelerate speech processor programming was investigated .    1.9313263651341268
for the monopolar stimulation mode used for the med - el and UNK implant systems , the average mal and threshold was expressed as a percentage of the average esrt across all electrodes .    2.1187077555372698
for the " common ground " stimulation mode used for the nucleus implant system , a parabolic transformation was used to relate mal and esrt to one another .    2.0922417685860037
these UNK between mal values calculated from the esrt and the actual mal values , determined UNK , UNK considerably from one another .    2.3884942263073867
therefore , it was not possible to determine the mal from the esrt with certainty .    2.9254517188641262
the esrt does , however , provide a means to estimate an approximate upper UNK for the mal , apart from its use to control implant function .    2.485210695675378
the determination of the exact mal will still need to be determined using behavioural techniques .    2.7034283002271895
movements and vibrations of intraocular structures can be observed during vitrectomy with mechanical cutting systems .    2.327897183805936
we experimentally compared these intraocular motion artifacts between mechanical and UNK : yag laser vitrectomy .    2.0995796721618087
spontaneous rupture und false aneurysms of the non - arteriosclerotic aorta are rare .    2.601190099348219
we report on a 53 - year - old patient with false aneurysm due to covered rupture of the thoraco abdominal aorta following sarcoidosis initially repaired by UNK aortic end - to - end anastomosis .    2.1720573189729997
after 6 months local recurrence occurred and the afflicted aorta was replaced by autologous arterial graft , transferring the right iliac artery as aortic patch .    2.0573575756268117
the iliac reconstruction was performed by ptfe interposition .    2.974381297437072
there was no specific therapy for sarcoidosis .    2.581376903951945
at 1 year follow - up there was no recurrence and the patient is free of symptoms .    3.741486474677616
in this biomechanical study the implanted unreamed humeral nail ( uhn ) has been tested concerning bending and torsional stiffnesses .    2.1734081515199115
in literature other intramedullary implants have been UNK for insufficient rotatory stability especially in transverse and short oblique fractures of the humeral shaft .    2.3204650058914
this study examined , whether the implanted uhn , as well as the uhn implanted with interfragmentary compression through a specific compression device , is able to augment torsional stiffness significantly .    2.3279805032703433
to evaluate bending and torsional stiffnesses , the uhn has been compared biomechanically to the UNK - UNK humeral nail ( rt ) in paired mid - shaft UNK cadaveric UNK .    2.155687657902294
UNK paired comparison has been performed with the uhn without and uhn with interfragmentary compression .    2.331019345195325
in anterior - posterior , as well as medio - lateral direction stiffness under four - point - bending is significantly higher in stabilizing with the rt .    2.196794360743237
under torsional loading with moments of 4 nm , 6 nm and 8 nm the uhn reached more than the double torsional stiffness .    1.9092268853414442
the rt , which is only dynamically interlocked , UNK a high initial " play " between bolts and nail itself .    2.1762627904860787
through additional interfragmentary compression stiffness of the uhn under four - point - bending in anterior - posterior , as well as medio - lateral direction UNK significantly .    2.076690867223424
also under torsional loading with moments of 4 nm , 6 nm und 8 nm torsional stiffness increases with interfragmentary compression significantly .    1.836801779768228
in comparison to other biomechanical studies of different UNK it is clear , that this statically interlocked intramedullary nailing of the humeral shaft is superior to non - statically interlocked types of nailing concerning their stabilizing potency in torsion and serves especially for fracture types , which are critically under rotation , as transverse or short oblique humeral shaft fractures .    2.105376920498928
while the different national health systems UNK structurally , cost expansion in health care is a global challenge .    2.168963258985475
structural UNK have been developed during recent years in the usa which can be summarized as " managed care " .    2.8914463872759426
they are characterized by the evolution of an economically orientated system , in which units of medical therapy are generally handled like conventional economical UNK .    2.3926726229257125
the spectrum of medical interventions as well as diagnostic or therapeutic patterns are predefined by a system of contracted guidelines , which lead to a standardization of processes .    2.4771742970848436
the autonomy of medical decisions is clearly reduced to UNK an integrated and economically oriented steering of the health system .    2.2848216618342687
leadership is no longer primarily confined to doctors or scientists .    2.4917544819928774
it is progressively shifting to financing institutions , managing UNK or insurance companies .    2.0287538257900595
structural changes currently are expanding rapidly in the u . s . and have meanwhile led to marked regional reductions of medical costs .    1.9575721794836223
historical development , current concepts of us - managed care , its potential influence and general applicability to the german situation are discussed in an overview .    2.3813596721004537
on the subject of natriuretic peptides there is a great deal of controversy , and intensive research efforts have been made studying their effects on electrolyte homeostasis .    2.488028849554276
in the early 1980s , a peptide that caused diuresis , natriuresis , and had a relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle was discovered independently by several groups .    2.0138273098820294
this was the breakthrough for the identification of natriuretic peptides , followed by the characterisation of the amino - acid sequences of several species .    2.3793741076178123
synthesis of the peptide , cloning of the encoding gene , identification and characterisation of specific receptors , as well as the development of antibodies and UNK were rapidly accomplished .    2.6694860969390897
later on , two new peptides were discovered brain natriuretic peptide ( UNK ) and c - type natriuretic peptide ( UNK ) .    2.5554119796774013
these peptides share structural features with cdd / anp with regard to their 17 - amino - acid - exhibiting loop UNK by a disulfide UNK .    2.2455791303821293
another recently discovered peptide is UNK ( uro ) , a renal - borne new member of a - type natriuretic peptide .    2.3143547768914123
uro was isolated from human urine and consists of the same sequence as cdd / anp , containing the 17 - amino - acid residue loop of the circulating hormone with 4 additional amino acids located at the UNK - UNK of the peptide .    2.5087702632588957
regarding physiological actions , data strongly support a close association between uro and urinary sodium excretion .    1.9853574091183899
the application of uro in animals revealed a stronger diuresis and natriuresis with a lower influence on arterial blood pressure compared to cdd / anp - 99 - 126 .    2.0604538220633914
these results were encouraging for the use of uro in clinical trials as a tool to prevent acute renal failure ( arf ) in patients following heart transplantation and for treatment of UNK arf in patients following liver transplantation .    2.61645924464614
UNK the results of these two studies , uro represents a new approach for not only prevention , but also for treatment of arf following organ transplantation .    2.8603347609122074
this opens up new possibilities for the treatment of arf of other origins in intensive care medicine .    2.4990222150832397
dermatomyositis in a 7 year old girl was diagnosed two months prior to admission to our pediatric rheumatology program .    2.34556805067235
serological and molecular biology methods were used to investigate the evidence for a recent UNK - b - UNK .    2.86923982779951
objectives wide approach to the posterior aspect of the scapula for internal fixation of unstable fractures of neck of scapula and glenoid .    2.540756745342171
the guideline " joint swelling " is addressed to primary care physicians - general practitioners , internists or orthopedists without special experience in rheumatology .    1.8699295355501815
it provides a framework for UNK patients , as well as for physical , laboratory and imaging examinations and for selection of treatment appropriate to the level of primary care .    2.7242834002176277
situations which call for urgent evaluation and criteria for referral to rheumatologists are described .    2.1616851087663016
the appendix contains comments on signs and symptoms to differentiate arthralgia from joint swelling and on the diagnostic value of a history of joint swelling without confirmation by the physician .    2.422034869621923
further recommendations for the evaluation of patient history and physical and technical examinations are given in a UNK form .    3.012102459661805
the significance of laboratory and imaging procedures is discussed .    2.579585882511053
introduction : bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy occur twice to three times more frequently than after an open procedure .    2.222099182063169
four different types of lesions may be differentiated by the UNK classification : postoperative bile fistulas ( type i ) , late strictures ( type ii ) , tangential injuries of the bile duct ( type iii ) and defect lesions ( type iv ) .    2.4888676559438405
the diagnostic and therapeutic management is demonstrated in relation to our own experience and the literature .    3.3094737365370013
methods : eleven patients ( median age 43 . 8 + / - 17 . 2 ) with bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy were operatively treated between november 1993 and december 1998 .    2.3751321242334433
nine patients ( four type - ii lesions , five type - iv lesions ) were referred from another hospital ; 2 defect lesions out of UNK laparoscopic cholecystectomies ( 0 . 5 % ) were documented in our own patient group .    2.389098676402528
results : four patients with late strictures were operatively treated with a UNK ( n = 2 ) or hepaticojejunostomy ( n = 2 ) after 14 . 3 + / - 8 . 4 months and were discharged from hospital after 10 . 6 + / - 3 . 8 days .    3.219225272759968
in both cases with type - iv lesion and a short defect , an end - to - end anastomosis was successful ( hospital stay 11 . 6 + / - 1 . 0 days ) .    2.4382200951557373
however , a UNK roux - y end - to - side hepaticojejunostomy was UNK in all cases with a larger defect ( n = 5 ; hospital stay 14 . 8 + / - 2 . 0 days ) .    2.9542986599087437
the two defect lesions in our own group were detected by intraoperative cholangiography and immediately treated after conversion either with UNK - UNK or hepaticojejunostomy ( hospital stay 11 . 2 + / - 0 . 6 days ) .    2.677656303261574
conclusions : the incidence of bile duct complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy might be kept down by anatomic preparation , selective intraoperative cholangiography and early consideration of conversion to open procedure .    2.1691261582017543
the clinical course after biliary tract injury can be positively influenced only by a standard diagnostic and operative procedure and by an early transfer to a specialized center .    2.096364734863431
the main aim of this study was to analyse the reason of the increase of incidence .    2.83035916862228
in the present autopsy series comprising 23 . UNK autopsies the percentage of patients who died of renal cell carcinoma is 1 , 77 % in jena and 1 , 55 % in UNK ( 200 . 000 inhabitants each ) .    2.3085658898844175
over this time the incidence of renal cell carcinoma in autopsies has increased .    2.962849737116406
with the advent of atypical antipsychotics , quality of life for patients with schizophrenia has improved significantly .    2.9630369633200444
the positive effects are based not only on the compliance - enhancing reduction of extrapyramidal side effects but also due to improved cognitive function and social integration , shorter duration , and overall reduction of hospital treatment .    2.047598983586266
the mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction is still high and according to recently published data amounts to 17 to 42 % .    2.1723340218861376
in the seventies introduction of thrombolytic therapy has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality of non - perioperative myocardial infarction .    2.818916500250207
however , in the perioperative situation thrombolytic therapy remains to be problematic in most cases because of expected severe bleeding complications .    2.4387595630652776
in the last 4 - 6 years acute - ptca has been established in the therapy of acute myocardial infarction .    3.0526273398101544
up to date no data are available concerning the effect of acute - ptca on mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction .    2.5837295641421356
nevertheless it can be assumed , that acute - ptca will lead to a considerable reduction in mortality of perioperative myocardial infarction .    2.864315348192228
therefore , in patients with significant perioperative myocardial infarction immediate coronary angiography and , if indicated , acute - ptca should be performed .    2.9229181317548316
in principle , thrombolytic therapy is considered to be contraindicated in the intra - or postoperative situation .    2.7022761691563364
however , if coronary angiography and ptca are not possible , thrombolysis might be taken into consideration , in particular if the expected bleeding complications are small in relation to the expected benefit of thrombolysis .    2.542378508068958
since acute - ptca has been shown to remarkably reduce mortality in patients with cardiogenic shock after acute myocardial infarction , this group of patients should be especially considered .    3.132677031948878
medical theories and practices concerning illness and health in old age as well as several aspects of society that do influence the aging process are described from a historical perspective integrating classical UNK , middle ages , and modern times .    2.1007397235052565
from the present state of research it is distinguished between " primary illnesses in old age " and chronical diseases which might principally also begin in younger ages but take a different course in old age .    2.027495795484752
even if the frequency of disease and multimorbidity is increasing , negative UNK of the aging process have to be UNK .    3.4258488116176093
advances in medical sciences are a good pre - condition for increasing physical and mental health in old age .    2.0778005814585137
the analysis of wall motion abnormalities with dobutamine stress echocardiography is an established method for the detection of myocardial ischemia .    2.7486127183060933
with ultrafast magnetic resonance tomography , the application of identical stress protocols as used for echocardiography is possible .    2.4477230034180466
transvaginal ultrasound provides an early and accurate technique to assess first trimester pregnancy .    2.214360204390265
beginning with the demonstration of an intrauterine gestational sac , sonography enables further evaluation of normal pregnancy development , such as identification of the embryo , visualization of the UNK sac , and the presence of fetal cardiac activity as a reassurance of fetal viability .    2.7755658804876697
furthermore it allows closed sonographic monitoring of early intrauterine pregnancy and distinction between normal and abnormal development of pregnancy .    2.1043094001715312
a prediction in terms of pregnancy outcome can be made regarding pregnancy complications or specific risks like vaginal bleeding , the demonstration of intrauterine hematoma , advanced maternal age , early growth delay or fetal bradycardia .    2.1534245818807416
because of the marked heterogeneity of patient groups and the diverse causes of obstruction , surgical therapy of the small - bowel ileus is difficult to standardize .    2.6561040445873525
a homogeneous strategy of intraoperative handling of the UNK bowel ( decompression , endoluminal splinting ) as well as abdominal closure would be desirable .    2.6311201762034515
small bowel plication is still used by a minority of surgeons with the UNK ' s technique replaced by the child - phillips ' technique and its modifications .    2.5229907205914293
however , as a result of the lack of controlled studies , there is no large body of evidence available to support the use of plication , long tubes or any other specific surgical intervention .    2.8638410504361635
this is an important task for the future , especially in view of incidence and economic importance of small bowel - ileus .    2.9456567419964057
purpose : the purpose of our study was to determine the value of mri in monitoring laser - induced interstitial thermotherapy ( litt ) of cerebral neoplasms .    2.3801545760979375
a 70 - year - old woman with severely symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy was unresponsive to drug treatment .    2.318011230893222
she had recurrent ventricular tachyarrhythmias and syncope and was at high risk for sudden death ; a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator ( ddd - ics ) was implanted .    2.1275642595134694
her initial left ventricular outflow tract gradient was 80 mmhg and UNK to 40 mmhg during dual - chamber pacing at an atrial ventricular delay of 140 ms .    2.0920847846787893
in the follow - up over six months she was asymptomatic with respect to angina pectoris ; ventricular tachycardias could be successfully terminated by antitachycardia pacing or by shocks .    2.2240372384232003
a dual chamber pacemaker defibrillator is an important therapeutic option for patients with symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy and ventricular tachyarrhythmias .    2.7608425252914417
morbihan ' s disease was first reported as a distinct entity in 1957 by UNK , describing a chronic persistent erythema and oedema of the upper half of the face .    2.7182708904162003
such conditions have been noted in the literature designated as chronic lymphoedema or solid persistent facial oedema in acne or rosacea .    2.2425269386110758
the characteristic features are a chronic course , a typical clinical picture , lack of specific laboratory and histological findings and refractoriness to therapeutic measures .    2.583235611879475
paediatric cardiac transplantation ( UNK ) has gained widespread acceptance as a therapy in end - stage myocardial failure and some forms of congenital heart disease , particularly hypoplastic left heart syndrome ( hlhs ) .    2.379261037168129
the major problems to the anaesthesiologist in these patients are induction of anaesthesia in infants with hlhs and treatment of pulmonary hypertension in the early post - bypass period .    3.063817088505782
today , cpr is widely viewed as an emergency procedure that can be attempted on any person who undergoes a cessation of cardiorespiratory function .    2.2391021082600586
therefore , the appropriateness of cpr has been questioned as a matter of the outcome , the patient ' s preferences , and the cost .    3.1505714650286136
the objective of this article is to analyse ethical issues in prehospital resuscitation .    2.28513681943841
arguments : cpr is bound by moral considerations that UNK the use of any medical treatment .    2.7202132165872674
according to UNK and UNK , the hierarchy of justification in biomedical ethics consists of ethical theories , principles , rules , and particular judgements and actions .    2.254014470560443
the decision to start cpr is based on the medical judgement that a person is suffering from circulatory arrest .    2.376040659337107
the decision is justified by the moral rule that the victim of a cardiac arrest has the right to survive and to receive cpr .    2.0620877273179263
moral rules are more specific to contexts and are based on ethical principles .    2.5448398146536606
the principle of beneficence means the provision of benefits for the promotion of welfare .    2.0384071263063532
talking about beneficence in resuscitation means once again reporting stories of success , as many victims of pre - and in - hospital sudden death have been saved in the past .    2.1992141144702932
nevertheless , resuscitative efforts still remain unsuccessful in the majority of cases , involving the principle of nonmaleficence .    2.7371571939631334
there is potential harm in cpr .    2.420184342837068
survivors may recover cardiac function , but UNK severe hypoxic brain damage , at worst surviving without awakening for months or years .    1.885823359294001
in particular , post - traumatic cpr is associated with an extremely poor outcome , leading to the issue of futility .    2.920716803699762
however , futility should be defined in a strict fashion , as there might be an individual chance of survival .    2.0872765062264116
the time frame in cpr requires medical decision - making within seconds , and cpr is usually initiated without the patient ' s involvement .    2.193157204204797
UNK ill but still competent patients should be encouraged to write a no - cpr document , which does not deny patients relief from severe symptoms , but might facilitate withholding resuscitative efforts at the scene .    1.9734125521610317
the decision made for a particular patient might delay or prevent emergency treatment in other patients who could receive greater benefit .    2.119161172051744
conclusions : the standard of care remains the prompt initiation of cpr .    2.363136008477621
however , ethical principles such as UNK , nonmaleficence , autonomy , and justice have to be applied in the unique setting of emergency medicine .    2.604124025162136
acting within the context of the therapeutic process is often equated with acting - out .    2.6897259821644317
UNK behaviour , too , as a part of the " complex system of sending and receiving unconscious signals " ( UNK ) which serve for the patient to induce behavior of the transference object in the analyst or fulfilling his unconscious wishes is seen as acting - out or UNK - out ( UNK ) .    2.558516588014375
however , this delicate acting has no meaning , it is not symbolic or communicative action .    2.438244978071565
it is aimed at inducing effects and interactions .    2.4499561794461684
diverse interactive means and ways will be demonstrated , how the analyst is moved to unnoticed acting and to handling the patient in an unnoticed manner in a certain way .    1.9729433092569286
the acting - reactions of the analyst may have the character of interpretations , by which he unintentionally demonstrates , in what a way he UNK the patient .    2.0656300899848543
background : the therapy of phimosis is circumcision .    2.7006486069572198
findings in previous investigations have indicated that contrast - enhanced colour doppler can be used to improve the demonstration of characteristic features of neovascularization in malignancies .    2.6024523771456427
however , the quantification of the increase in colour doppler signals after levovist in the cited study relied only on descriptive criteria defined by the investigator , resulting in a subjective scoring system .    2.1129610387575926
a computer - assisted method for quantitative analysis of colour pixel density is a novel approach for objective assessment of colour doppler signal after contrast media administration .    2.1659834799956785
after UNK contrast medium injection in 47 patients , carcinomas and benign lesions UNK differently regarding degree , onset and duration of doppler enhancement .    2.1066618036594584
however , the high interindividual variability and the temporal variations of the doppler signal still limit the value of these criteria for prospective diagnosis .    2.461465024703692
rapid image - acquisition techniques are needed in order to apply the necessary mathematical processing before the contrast kinetics can be used for diagnostic purposes .    2.549072635789384
recent studies have shown that increased intraocular pressure following keratoplasty may cause progressive endothelial cell loss and thereby lead to early transplant failure .    2.0318190602121646
this study examined risk groups for development of postoperative glaucoma and thereby transplant failure .    2.159494877430281
dysphagia is a common complaint following surgical intervention in the oral cavity and hypopharynx , often leading to prolonged postoperative recovery .    2.455868340174753
videofluoroscopy allows detailed visualization of deglutition , demonstrating the morphology as well as the functional aspects .    2.5475676779774723
therefore , videofluoroscopy provides the basis for further therapeutic management .    2.5567770989283387
we discuss the pathology of deglutition in 19 patients recovering from tumor surgery of the UNK - and hypopharynx .    3.2311801060465783
in most cases the results demonstrated severe impairment of both the oral and pharyngeal phase of deglutition .    2.4210601961550413
our data emphasize the importance of the oral phase of deglutition for preparation and initiation of the following phases .    2.997090179765
people who suffer a stroke most often experience a major crisis in their lives .    2.11157291810597
this leads to psychological problems which are likely to influence the patient ' s life satisfaction , long - term rehabilitation outcome , and quality of life as much as the physical consequences caused by the stroke .    2.8689124474388343
the patient ' s ability to accept the new reality created by a disability as a part of their future life is therefore essential .    2.3130015304101197
this necessitates an individual coping strategy in the center of which is a mourning process , which UNK in the same way as other experiences of vital threat , e . g .    2.5073104894239
confrontation with one ' s own dying .    2.911390911643998
different stages of mourning that can also be found in stroke patients are UNK of the facts , UNK emotions , UNK with the former and finding of a new self as well as new perspectives for one ' s future .    3.1440639232088685
whether a coping process is successful does not depend on the type of the defense mechanisms or stages , but essentially on their persistence .    2.291294596203278
it is the task of the therapeutical team to support this process by applying a basic therapeutic behavior , stage - consistent interventions and a positive feedback .    2.0272061232782583
a failed process of coping may be one of the causes of the high prevalence of psychological disorders like depression and anxiety disorders in patients having UNK a stroke .    2.6706245114880365
a 63 - year - old woman developed a pruritic exanthema on the extremities after one hour of work in her garden UNK in UNK , southern bavaria .    2.296917693228194
as the appropriate UNK ( UNK and UNK ) were present , we made the tentative diagnosis of cercarial dermatitis ( UNK ' s UNK ) .    3.3706920375969887
by different serological methods ( cercarial fluorescent antibody test , cercarial UNK reaction , UNK UNK test ) antibodies against UNK could be demonstrated in the serum of the patient 14 days later .    2.6766396686737326
cercarial dermatitis appears worldwide , but in central europe the disease is often not recognized .    2.8208579166211285
the current adjustment of cochlear implant ( ci ) speech UNK is based on a knowledge of the lower and upper limits ( t - and c - levels ) for electrical stimulus currents .    2.5710830569681877
these data are usually acquired from subjective classifications of individual patients .    2.202291957265019
in cases with non - reliable patient responses , objective methods are necessary .    2.415884198048359
especially for the estimation of correct t - levels , auditory evoked potentials ( aep ) can be applied , since they allow the determination of response thresholds in a frequency - specific manner .    2.5344638262791226
by determining the aep of different latencies , late cortical responses can be registered almost without artifact contamination .    1.9817595285754508
these patients have been examined in 20 patients provided with 22 - or 8 - channel ci - systems ( nucleus or med - el implants ) .    2.3654683402718057
in all cases , clear responses and clearly discernible threshold transitions could be detected .    2.215294515240303
by making use of acoustical stimulation in a free sound field , subjective hearing threshold and the t - levels of electrical stimulation could be verified .    2.0719850221400833
since late responses are generated in the primary auditory cortex , their assessment permits a nearly integral functional control of the aided hearing system .    2.1412228698242073
to date , no problems have occured from maturation or attentional effects in either pediatric or adult patients .    1.915111282177648
the applicability in very young children remains to be explored .    2.461433662311638
laparoscopic gastric banding has become a common procedure in bariatric surgery .    2.491209760522396
early as well as late complications are , in comparison to conventional techniques , rare .    3.3288755683716853
complications arising from the operative technique are : perforation , early pouch dilatation , gastric slippage , infections of the port and the band , erosion and defects of the band tube .    2.244528420365539
insufficient weight loss and late pouch dilatation arise from unsatisfactory compliance on the part of the patient .    2.50262329852591
obstruction of the pouch UNK and a slippage resulted in total food intolerance .    2.929210087860225
after radiologic diagnosis the band system should be UNK first and a UNK - gastric tube applied .    2.7003373654648493
if this does not result in the pouch UNK , a revision operation is needed .    3.1990602423269423
the significant legal and UNK UNK of a positive drug test produce an incentive among users of illicit drugs to escape detection .    2.4356779552841665
therefore , being the UNK body fluid to handle for drug screening urine is very often manipulated to test clean .    2.06505569260649
methods available to cause a negative result range from substitution of urine , UNK of the collected specimen by various chemical agents and in - vivo manipulations .    2.4295357662753383
among these , the preferred strategy is to increase fluid intake and urine flow so as to UNK the concentration of drugs below the threshold of detection .    2.4959580525351637
to determine the extent of possible specimen dilution the urinary creatinine concentration is generally determined .    2.6313393885600145
based on data from uncontrolled and controlled fluid intake studies in the literature and physiological conditions of urinary excretion , the meaningfulness of creatinine concentration in randomly obtained urine samples is discussed .    2.0493196357071346
a low creatinine concentration not clearly proving an intentional dilution of the sample , the application of gc / ms analysis or the concentration of the urine prior to drug screening is recommended for specimens exhibiting a " suspect " urinary creatinine concentration .    2.12367293395049
goal : intracranial pressure ( icp ) monitoring has a key role within the UNK , although icp does not monitor processes of the central neuron directly and only with delay .    2.302744976865015
one of the important factors in icp monitoring is measurement accuracy .    2.6602127602382826
for a better understanding of icp probes and their differences , the function and principles of intracranial pressure transducers should be evaluated from a technical point of view .    2.273847597257082
the therapy for spontaneous or artificial perforation of the esophagus remains a controversial matter .    2.4740959513346774
the following case report deals with the medical history of an artificial esophageal perforation after operative treatment of cervical disc disease .    2.5998651975170333
a 68 - year - old male patient underwent a c4 / c5 and c5 / UNK discectomy with interbody fusion of c7 - t1 vertebral body , according to smith - robinson .    1.9747539277361694
during this operation , a 3 - cm - long lesion was made in the posterior wall of the esophagus , which was treated 24 h later with a primary suture .    2.78410379418518
the clinical follow - up was complicated by mediastinitis with subsequent multiorgan failure .    2.584487248482935
after recovery from this critical condition the patient complained of severe dysphagia , which was related to a persistent lesion in the posterior esophageal wall with endoscopically demonstrated dislocation of a screw .    2.3917364114787416
after removal of the screw , the lesion was covered by means of UNK UNK .    3.1461572878819704
moderate postoperative dysphagia was successfully treated by UNK .    2.9709293442404485
introduction : the loss of functional capacity by peripheral nerve lesion is easy to be estimated : a certain neurologic dysfunction results in a characteristic reduction of the former individual capacity .    2.519078920294112
in this study , we compared the results of judgement in nerve lesions under the circumstances of additional pain syndromes .    2.545846352074533
the guidelines of the international union against cancer are generally used to assess malignancy of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin .    2.733338097993571
beside tnm - staging , histological grading is performed .    2.4256559974060115
this system has been extended by a selection of histological parameters which were studied with respect to prognosis , based on a review of 184 patients with squamous cell carcinoma .    2.815560794041643
an increased malignancy was found in carcinomas with the following features : clinical diameter greater than 2 cm , low degree of keratinization , high degree of cellular polymorphism , high mitotic index and high tumor thickness index ( metastases only from tumor thickness 2 , 4 mm and subcutaneous infiltration ) , desmoplasia and ulceration .    1.9567190361461686
consideration of histological tumor parameters improved prognosis assessment .    2.415088094498105
multivariate analyses with large case series are necessary to determine ranks of the prognostic factors .    2.344741337255015
therefore , the data analysis of all centers that contribute to the carcinoma registry will make a precise UNK of high - and low - risk carcinomas possible and can thus influence therapy and follow - up procedures .    2.589087931613436
for a transcatheter closure , however , x - ray exposure has been indispensable .    2.989886561859055
we report a closure of an atrial septal defect under transesophageal echocardiography without fluoroscopy .    2.1053183999481053
in field research , training intensity was tested during three different dances by recording the exercise heart rates .    2.016847293147856
the subjects ( twelve women from 59 to 77 years old ) were tested once a week three times , over three minutes with a break of three minutes , three weeks in all .    1.9480220234097727
the sequence of the dances changed every week .    2.455969290886734
in this retrospective study the baroreflex sensitivity was obtained noninvasively by measuring the systolic blood pressure with a UNK - device and correlating this with the r - r intervals of the ecg after raising blood pressure with an intravenous dose of UNK ( UNK ) .    2.3771560435331467
according to other investigators a correlation of > 0 . 7 with a significance of p < 0 . 05 was recommended for evaluable results with a baroreflex sensitivity < 3 ms / mm hg being judged as decreased .    2.086809192745664
we investigated 302 patients ( mean age 59 + / - 17 years , 224 males , 78 females ) .    2.416868861049551
75 % of the investigations showed acceptable results .    3.061332069844608
in 77 cases ( 25 % ) reasonable results could not be achieved .    2.7564990489779726
we found premature ventricular beats to be responsible in 18 investigations ( 6 % of all investigations ) .    2.722113622149551
41 ( 13 . 1 % ) of all investigations were not evaluable because of bad correlation for unknown reason .    2.7919100016953147
when we looked closely at these UNK results , we found a significantly higher number of patients with impaired left ventricular ejection fraction ( < 40 % ) , diabetes or inducible sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia in the electrophysiologic study in this group .    2.959090355314295
embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas of the female genital tract usually occur during infancy in the vagina .    2.1794157051561065
only in rare cases can they be found in the cervix , where they are most commonly seen in adolescence .    2.7493144314104354
their prognosis seems to be good since the introduction of a combination of surgery and chemotherapy .    3.422587508090093
we report a case of cervical embryonal UNK in irs stage ia in a 32 - year - old female .    2.204246030740737
after surgical resection and chemotherapy there has been no evidence of disease for 7 months .    2.84033234902132
the case is compared with the published literature and prognostically relevant features , and possible problems in the differential diagnosis in biopsies are discussed .    2.6207204002196924
between 1987 and 1993 , 41 grade UNK open tibial shaft fractures were treated with the unreamed tibial nail ( urtn n = 22 ) or an external fixator ( fix n = 19 ) .    2.1922762261015287
the method of treatment was left to the choice of the operating surgeon .    3.09916074402982
three below the knee amputations were performed , three patients died , and three were lost to follow - up .    2.4029428213924815
in all , 32 patients were followed up to union or at least for 1 year .    2.6761286860528393
there were no significant statistical differences between the two groups ( p < 0 . 2 , chi - squared , t - test ) with respect to fracture type , fracture location , age , gender or accompanying injuries .    2.7376477407869566
in all , 15 / 17 urtn patients and only 6 / 15 fix patients achieved unlimited walking distance ( p < 0 . 01 m - w ) .    2.028923324468075
time to bony union , infection , and nonunion were not significantly different between groups .    2.3673819144539308
by varying the light spectrum , impulse length , impulse sequences and UNK , the UNK allows a large choice of individual treatment parameters .    2.536631490115852
superficial as well as deeper localized vascular malformations ( essential UNK , port - wine stains , UNK of UNK , UNK malformations ) and cosmetically UNK hypertrichosis can be treated successfully with this high intensity UNK pulsed light source .    2.5620287000125375
catheter ablation is an established method to treat paroxysmal supraventricular tachyarrhythmias .    2.568487998367731
however , the risks of catheter ablation have to UNK weight against antiarrhythmic therapy .    2.5843106410355614
with catheter ablation av - block iii ° , pulmonary embolism , pericardial tamponade ( in some cases followed by death ) , arterial embolism as well as other complications have been described .    2.4707373364455676
especially the long term consequences of prolonged fluoroscopy time are an increased risk for fatal malignancies in young patients .    2.5450289952004423
on the other hand the efficacy of antiarrhythmic therapy in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia has been shown .    3.0097472797665517
the risk of proarrhythmia associated with the treatment with class 1 and class 3 antiarrhythmic drugs that has been documented in patients after UNK infarction and in heart failure patients cannot be transferred to patients without structural heart disease .    2.564467915020971
it is concluded that drug therapy is still an important form of treatment in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia .    2.9765132297519092
background : chloroquine keratopathy is known as a disease with epithelial deposits in the cornea .    2.474837652597258
dermatological rehabilitation treatment can take different forms : UNK - therapy , baths , phototherapy and psychosomatic treatments .    2.1477107475171713
which of these treatments is of most benefit to any one patient depends on his or her illness .    2.2632386846325576
accordingly , a psychosomatic approach to dermatological illness is indicated mainly when a psychological disorder and a dermatological disease UNK .    1.9569571619135786
in UNK , dermatoses with psychological triggers or UNK , and also depression , pre - existing emotional disorders and special motivation for psychotherapy should be considered for psychosomatic treatment .    2.7751769756025695
finally , patients who are having UNK accepting or UNK malignant skin tumours may also benefit .    2.2516219543269895
we report about the possibility of electrophysiological diagnosis and therapy in the treatment of a symptomatic left ventricular tachycardia which could not be treated effectively by oral medical therapy in a 10 year old boy with no obvious structural heart disease .    2.789331420812297
by right bundle - bloc - like qrs - complexes in the surface - ecg , the diagnosis of the ventricular origin of the tachycardia was confirmed by transesophageal - ecg .    2.5714849935059125
this was followed by the first electrophysiological examination that showed increased UNK vulnerability .    2.6694769566877707
during this electrophysiological examination the tachycardia was terminated by stimulated UNK premature beats .    2.1527383547524397
an oral medical therapy with sotalol was started .    2.5318906463959903
after the phase of saturation the next ventricular stimulation was done , that showed no sufficient protection of sotalol against vt .    2.0867429336824803
so the decision was made for ventricular ablation .    2.437574849242364
after 5 high frequency - applications no UNK ventricular tachycardia could be induced .    2.370492382078592
since this intervention the patient lives without symptoms .    2.388234411230772
the vertebral bodies and vertebral UNK show a characteristic distribution of cortical and cancellous bone .    2.2278523542004076
the ligaments of the vertebral column consist of longitudinal and ( with exception of the UNK .    2.8541782149943997
longitudinale UNK ) horizontal / oblique segmental ligament bundles .    2.2099431939225225
in combination with the anulus fibrosus , the ligaments work as a kind of UNK system .    2.4936855369504185
they regulate the process of movements of UNK vertebral bodies in a very precise manner and control the final phase of motion .    2.303767346431938
besides maintaining the necessary amount of UNK the intervertebral disc UNK the UNK uniformly onto the adjacent vertebral bodies .    2.5595275942178013
the intervertebral joints are important for guided motion , by restricting the extent in specific planes and directions .    2.089859774793159
because of their position , they are able to take up the shear forces and to simultaneously restrict them in different planes .    2.3252504841581767
the integrity of the fascia UNK warrants the protective function of the UNK muscles .    3.2003776738813476
prolonged immobilization or physical inactivity has been shown to produce increased bone resorption due to enhanced UNK activity and diminished bone formation .    2.132197919305835
these skeletal changes are a typical complication in UNK patients , who are at risk of developing hypocalcemia .    3.0343943633293473
hypercalciuria is the most characteristic symptom .    3.3308062058135737
risk factors for development of malignant melanoma have been investigated in several case control studies during the last decade , with some variation in results , partly with geographical region .    2.3988432409836773
four studies have been conducted under the auspices of the central malignant melanoma registry of the german dermatological society ; these have yielded consistent results allowing the identification of risk factors for melanoma development .    2.4055590706426866
additional factors were hair colour , skin type and a history of naevus growth .    2.3954995538450565
for example , in individuals with more than 50 common melanocytic naevi , 5 or more atypical melanocytic naevi and simultaneous presence of actinic lentigines the risk of developing melanoma was found to be 100 - fold that in persons with 10 common melanocytic naevi or fewer and without atypical melanocytic naevi or actinic lentigines .    2.2584636483106966
early recognition of melanomas may be substantially improved if these risk factors are considered .    2.396479695476843
furthermore , intermittent intensive sun exposure ( UNK as indicator ) before the age of 20 induces the development of melanocytic naevi , and after the age of 20 it contributes to the development of actinic lentigines ; both factors are associated with an increased risk of melanoma development .    2.747491752030581
problem : clinical and ultrasound data of neonatal hips were analysed to answer the question whether a neonatal screening is necessary or not .    2.1683961834028427
method : children born between 1 .    2.877466217232633
1995 were examined clinically and by ultrasound .    3.004268094867562
the data were analysed by spss / pc .    2.4668024368495702
results : UNK children with 10 138 hips were examined .    2.253682428461771
85 % were mature ( type i ) , 14 % were physiologically immature ( type iia ) and 1 . 2 % were pathological ( UNK , d , iiia ) .    2.5897636468037843
the comparison shows , that from 119 hips with pathological ultrasound findings only 44 ( 37 % ) had positive clinical findings .    2.1395681820547985
a screening that is restricted to children with positive risk factors ( positive family history or breech position ) would result in half of the newborns with pathological hips not being treated in time .    2.1520715777012698
the interpretation of three - dimensional ( 3d ) structures of the coronary tree and the myocardium by a clinician demands a subjective visual integration of two - dimensional ( 2d ) images of cardiac diagnostic procedures like coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy .    2.314393070995807
although in the conventional analysis of 2d display scintigraphic myocardial perfusion segments are UNK assigned to three major coronary artery systems , the standard myocardial perfusion distribution territories correspond with the individual pathologic - anatomic coronary tree in only 50 - 60 % of the patients .    2.042043874564391
hence , the mental integration UNK both 2d images of coronary angiography and myocardial scintigraphy does not necessarily allow an accurate assignment of particular myocardial perfusion regions to the corresponding vessels .    2.041297557509704
for an objective assignment of each vessel segment of the coronary tree to the corresponding myocardial regions , we have developed a 3d " fusion image " technique and applied it to patients with coronary artery disease .    2.334330615788593
cause - and - effect relationships may be more obvious with 3d data fusion and may enable an easier comparison of anatomy and physiology .    2.097190465201429
the physician ' s duty of professional discretion is one of the basic UNK at the heart of the doctor ' s profession .    2.7323811539695515
it is laid down in the physicians ' professional code and determined ultimately by the patient ' s right to self - determination , which is regulated in §203 of the german criminal code .    2.3644699775819453
it is established in the UNK governing physicians ' work and has its origin in the patient ' s right of self - determination .    2.9079406877300866
it is also regulated in §203 of the german criminal code .    2.3926114869281903
an exception can be made to the duty of professional UNK if a patient gives express permission for this or if it is allowed or required by law .    2.185040186534279
some such exceptions are also specified in the german social code , although the physician ' s duty of disclosure is then always precisely stated , particularly when medical data in the UNK sense of the UNK are concerned .    2.712736094815595
borderline cases are described to illustrate how the rules of professional medical discretion are UNK in the course of day - to - day UNK UNK between the statutory accident insurance firms and the physicians under contract to them , and some hints are given on how this can be avoided .    2.392555081208696
during this therapy he subsequently developed the following cutaneous neoplasms : squamous cell carcinomas , basal cell carcinomas , UNK ' s disease , actinic keratosis , sebaceous hyperplasia , a dysplastic naevus and , finally a nodular malignant melanoma .    2.1375020742286304
adverse effects of the cyclosporin a therapy are discussed , with special reference to dermatologic effects and the implications for patient and doctor .    2.7444967727585174
with multislice spiral computed tomography ( msct ) , existing indications for performing ct of the chest are strengthened and new applications are emerging .    2.2904787632956993
the high speed of msct improves efficiency , image quality and patient comfort of " routine " - imaging of the chest .    2.2923621006690604
the ability to cover large volumes with thin slices improves the evaluation of mediastinal lymph nodes and pulmonary nodules and allows for high - quality secondary reconstruction .    2.4608146466847827
if a comprehensive diagnosis of the mediastinal structures and the pulmonary parenchyma is desired , msct for the first time allows reconstruction of contiguous and high - resolution ( hrct ) sections from the same set of thin - collimation UNK data .    2.3206204334605647
this way , contiguous chest images of superior and hrct sections of equal image quality compared to conventional ct scanning can be obtained .    2.1097184515125367
vascular protocols greatly benefit from the high speed of msct : for imaging the thoracic aorta or pulmonary emboli ( pe ) , the amount of contrast material can be substantially reduced .    2.5430831302804138
owing to thin collimation , the detection - rate of small peripheral emboli can be significantly increased .    2.249711998887894
if indicated , the entire UNK venous system can be evaluated during the same session , without additional contrast material .    2.4431369207654483
abstract basis of the modern shoulder implants is the neer ii - system , a non constrained total shoulder prosthesis with UNK radii of curvature and improved protection against dislocation .    2.2802865173801496
the second generation of shoulder prosthesis is based on the geometric shaft design of the neer ii prosthesis and offers not only a variety of modular head - and shaft - sizes but also through different radii a physiologic rotation - translation - mechanism .    2.167211216127324
the third generation of humeral head prosthesis carries the concept of an anatomic reconstruction one step further and enables the surgeon to adjust the inclination and the UNK UNK of the humeral head to restore the centre of rotation .    2.7679957686290773
the latest development in shoulder arthroplasty are humeral head prosthesis with a fully variable 3 - dimensional UNK to independently adjust the UNK head position regardless of the individual shaft geometry .    2.1578135074490783
this achieves a 3 - dimensional UNK of the prosthetic head about the stem axis in the coronary and in the sagittal plane .    3.0704768168900483
besides of the humeral shaft prosthesis an alternative concept of shoulder joint replacement is established - the replacement of the humeral head articular surface .    2.427427770469022
a hemispheric surface prosthesis - cup arthroplasty - is cemented onto the residual humeral head , which UNK the obligatory humeral head resection and the reaming of the medullary canal .    1.9322623763972349
bipolar shoulder prosthesis are humeral shaft prosthesis with a bi - rotational head system .    2.1854540960382507
their indication is limited to pre - existing lesions of the rotator cuff and / or the glenoid surface .    3.255716407203707
the hemispheric glenoid component serves as the centre of rotation for the concave epiphyseal proximal humerus component .    2.0529061523946317
this implant is especially used in cases of massive rotator cuff deficiences .    2.702878650647209
the role of shoulder prosthesis in treating acute humeral head fractures needs special consideration .    2.30775821396432
a fracture prosthesis has to restore the exact length of the humerus , the centre of rotation , and the anatomical UNK .    2.929964722649152
positioning of the tubercula and their adequate osteosynthesis is most critical and fundamental to ensure a correct healing process .    2.168157229424775
a failed consolidation of the tubercula does not lead to a satisfying result .    2.656925899439571
the shoulder joint replacement can be sufficiently fixated in cemented , cementless or hybrid techniques .    2.22738849343966
today several component design variations of cemented glenoid implants exist .    2.131373691054157
their main distinction is the fixation system which can be divided into two main groups - the UNK - and the peg - shaped glenoid components .    2.758041725745287
the peg - shaped anchorage system shall guarantee a greater stability against shear - forces .    1.9756477528297818
cementless glenoid components consist of a UNK inlay and a surface treated metal - back with an integrated fixation system .    2.3765863362816098
these fixation systems are object of intensive biomechanical research and range from conventional screw fixation to specialised cone systems and self - cutting UNK - screw - systems .    2.0220650180781514
the critical area of cementless glenoid components is the transition zone of the pe - inlay and the metal - back because of high force development .    2.111850220443078
the question of implanting a hemi - or total shoulder prosthesis is answered by the morphologic changes of the glenoid articular surface , which includes the size of the subchondral defect and the underlying etiology of the shoulder joint disease , and the age of the patient .    2.943955202269818
preoperative planning must consist of an adequate radiologic work - up - x - ray , ct or mri - to accurately assess the glenoid morphology .    2.5269411179105408
g . UNK UNK the different glenoid lesions and developed a very important classification of possible glenoid deformations .    2.6961853938368994
to compare and evaluate the operative results one must consider the different shoulder prosthesis and the discrepancies between a hemi - and a total shoulder prosthetic replacement .    2.146254097754113
looking at the loosening and survival rate of the implant the results are related to the type of prosthesis and the preoperative diagnosis .    3.2299794193462734
the neer total shoulder prosthesis has a 15 year survival rate of 87 % , compared to 74 % of the hemi - prosthesis .    2.837277138554577
the objective for the future has to be to further advance the development of prosthetic components , especially for primary joint replacement in acute humeral head fractures .    2.703934513689632
another point of interest is how to reduce the still existing high loosening rates of the glenoid components .    2.3502835999325886
a fairly new research - field is the computer - assisted surgery , e . g . navigation systems and robotics .    2.384911195195403
the computer - assisted navigation could be of great advantage to accurately find the individual resection plane ( inclination and UNK ) of the humeral head .    2.6833099806378273
two patients with complete paralysis of the axillary nerve are reported on .    2.687634267940412
one case is well documented .    2.916453292565007
in both cases there was very good functional adaptation , resulting from hypertrophy of the rotator cuff so that there was only a slight or no loss of movement .    2.300756726499809
the rotator cuff should therefore be exercised at an early stage when there is isolated axillary nerve damage .    2.4329272328701346
johann friedrich dieffenbach ( UNK - 1847 ) is generally known as the founder of modern plastic surgery .    2.4590602020612042
one focus of his work , apart from the physiology of transplantation and operative techniques , was reconstructive oral and maxillofacial surgery .    2.2256574499236894
this special aspect of plastic surgery as well as dieffenbach ' s biography is presented in this historic article .    2.4676250942368365
if the patient is dead on arrival , the manner of death will in most cases unsettled .    2.5115577103958833
in these cases the physician should inform the police immediately .    2.383381562293174
any alteration of the scene of death should be avoided .    2.832831607208168
the purpose of this review is to outline the laparoscopic - endoscopic procedures that we perform for early gastric cancer .    1.9724716043364101
these procedures were applied to 29 patients .    2.80688673314443
preoperative work - up included gastric endoscopy , barium x - ray examination , endoscopic ultrasonography , and histological examination , and surgery was performed in patients diagnosed as having mucosal gastric cancer for which endoscopic mucosal resection ( UNK ) was difficult .    2.7449803993300934
laparoscopic wedge resection of the stomach using the lesion - lifting method , by which a wedge resection is made while UNK up the full - thickness gastric wall , was carried out in the 16 patients with lesions of the anterior wall , lesser curvature , and greater curvature of the stomach .    2.4060790526751337
on pathological examination of resected specimens , the surgical margin and lymphatic or venous invasion were negative in all these patients .    2.1416168811171183
the histological depth of the lesions was m ( mucosal cancer ) in 15 patients and sm1 ( slight cancer infiltration into the submucosal layer ) in one .    2.098225067603799
this one patient later underwent gastrectomy but no lymph node metastases were found .    2.3803283583836454
oral nutrition was resumed for a mean ( + / - sd ) of 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 8 days after operation , and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12 . 3 + / - 3 . 4 days .    3.1502100060340563
the 13 patients with lesions of the posterior wall of the stomach and near the cardia or the pylorus received laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection .    2.542794864477646
laparotomy was required in 1 of these patients due to intraoperative hemorrhage .    3.2430317792585748
the surgical margins were negative in all 12 patients in whom laparoscopic intragastric mucosal resection was successful .    2.3103770290166827
lymphatic or venous invasion was positive in 2 , both of whom had sm1 cancer lesions of both of these patients were located in the cardiac region , total gastrectomy was avoided , and careful observation is continued .    2.317965517958763
oral nutrition was resumed 4 . 0 + / - 1 . 6 days after operation , and the duration of hospitalization after operation was 12 . 0 + / - 3 . 5 days .    3.140534695511654
in addition , no postoperative complication was noted after either procedure , and all patients have been recurrence free for a follow - up period of 460 months .    2.397327978058862
selected properly , these laparoscopic endoscopic procedures are considered to be curative and minimally invasive treatments for early gastric cancer .    2.2072238590119704
between 1988 and 1997 , tumor resection was carried out in 18 irradiated patients ( group 1 : 36 - 72 gy , 83 implants ) and 22 nonirradiated patients ( group 2 : 92 implants ) in the mandible and floor of the mouth , and these patients subsequently underwent mandibular endosseous implant rehabilitation .    2.2596972712300945
a total of 23 patients were treated with exclusively implant - supported prostheses , and 16 with implant tissue - supported constructions .    2.574256414707444
between 1988 and 1991 , group 1 and 2 patients received implant tissue - supported prostheses ( using two to four implants ) .    2.411953263940585
due to prosthesis - related pressure lesions , the strategy has now been changed .    2.2446258541676367
since 1992 , group 1 patients have received exclusively implant - supported prostheses ( using five to six implants ) , while group 2 patients have received implant tissue - supported constructions ( using four implants ) .    2.089269214614724
special criteria for the success of implant - supported maxillofacial prosthetics were drawn up .    2.848686783009994
with an average follow - up period of 37 months , 160 UNK ( 91 % ) were clinically osseointegrated .    2.7851330858775984
both types of restoration provided sufficient oral rehabilitation .    2.305159123604327
however , only completely implant - supported prostheses avoided soft tissue ulcers .    2.3284180441295472
the overall success rate was about 77 % after 7 years in group 1 and about 87 % after 9 years in group 2 .    2.4777860452356038
with regard to implants placed after strategy change , the 5 - year success rate was approximately 86 % ( group 1 ) and 94 % ( group 2 ) .    2.5274827844036043
in irradiated patients , an exclusively implant - supported prosthesis without any mucosal contact ( thus avoiding soft tissue ulcers with a potential to develop UNK ) should therefore be fabricated .    2.097788265916019
implant tissue - supported restoration is also possible in nonirradiated oral cancer patients .    2.4308587403706094
extracorporal shock wave therapy ( eswt ) has been postulated as an additional therapeutic option in nonunion after fracture treatment .    2.3776977513977213
we have reexamined patients with nonunions treated at our institution to evaluate the efficacy of the method .    2.7574817858285448
in a prospective UNK study patients were investigated with a minimum duration of nonunion of 6 months .    2.561643504828341
following 2 cycles of eswt with 2000 impulses / 18 kv , the reevaluation was performed at 1 , 3 and 6 months after treatment .    2.2759653816551983
a total of 27 pseudarthroses was UNK , in 11 one or more UNK had been performed prior to eswt .    2.591315459645028
the clinical evidence of subjective , clinical improvement was found in 5 of these patients within 1 month , in all of these patients within a period of 3 months .    2.846761937963745
radiologic evidence of improvement occurred in none of these patients within 1 month , in all of these patients within 6 months .    2.5756449579700456
eswt appears to represent an additional treatment option in patients with longstanding nonunion .    3.039294554639502
if no improvement occurs , the maximum delay of UNK is three months .    2.4964196542452948
over a period of 11 years a total of 140 liver resections for non - colorectal , non - neuroendocrine hepatic metastases were performed in 127 patients ( 73 women , 54 men ; median age 53 years ) .    2.4082815729074474
there were 120 first , 14 second and 6 third liver resections .    2.1616553698848047
primary tumors were : breast cancer ( n = 34 ) , leiomyosarcoma ( n = 20 ) , pancreatic cancer ( n = 16 ) , renal cell carcinoma ( n = 13 ) , melanoma ( n = 9 ) , gastric cancer ( n = 9 ) , lung cancer ( n = 6 ) and adrenal cancer ( n = 6 ) and UNK tumors ( n = 14 ) .    2.9869362612615897
extrahepatic tumor manifestation ( including synchronous primary tumors ) was found in 69 / 140 cases ( 49 % ) ; 61 of 120 patients with a first liver resection had extrahepatic tumor ( 51 % ) .    2.454733090020155
median survival after first liver resection was 20 months ; after r0 resection a median survival of 28 months and after r1 / 2 resection of 8 months was achieved .    2.2487424259511055
the 5 - year survival rate was 16 % for the total group , 24 % in patients with r0 resection and 0 % for r1 / 2 resections .    2.689436521487764
after a second liver resection ( n = 14 ) there was a median survival of 28 months ( 5 - year - survival - rate of 21 % ) for all patients and of 41 months ( 5 - year survival rate 38 % ) after r0 resection .    2.9047351617837083
morbidity and mortality after the first liver resection were 32 . 5 % and 5 . 8 % , respectively .    3.3491493148252607
in patients without extrahepatic tumor at the time of the first liver resection a median survival of 32 months ( 5 - year survival rate 25 % ) and 7 months was achieved after r0 resection and r1 / 2 resection , respectively .    2.7544937228804405
in case of extrahepatic tumor the median survival was 24 months ( 5 - year survival rate 23 % ) for r0 resection compared to 8 months after r1 / 2 resection .    2.5023347687067656
these data suggest that not the presence of extrahepatic tumor but rather the possibility of a r0 resection is most decisive for the prognosis after liver resection .    2.6774484324617474
we conclude that patients with liver metastases of non - colorectal , non - neuroendocrine tumors may benefit from liver resection .    2.650689371770495
similar to colorectal metastases , a second or third liver resection can be worthwhile in selected cases .    2.072950199035882
even in more unfavorable tumor entities , several cases of long - term survival were observed after surgical therapy .    2.6299899601017445
UNK about the outcomes of psychotherapy are essentially based on research on brief therapies with quite short follow - up .    2.084256351658753
the present paper is a survey of some of the findings in an effectiveness study of psychoanalysis and long - term psychotherapy , typically UNK oriented , in private practice .    2.5476381276073123
the design was a three - wave panel comprising more than 700 patients .    2.32283929677212
at the end of the third wave , UNK patients in different phases of treatment remained in the sample .    2.583931315062841
across a reconstructed time scale covering roughly seven years , before , during , and after treatment , the 74 psychoanalysis cases described a very positive development , whereas the development among the 331 psychotherapy cases was moderately positive .    2.145107631953224
the findings emphasize the importance of extended follow - up .    2.9190483075439175
when therapist variables are considered , therapeutic experience had complex or mixed associations with patients outcome .    2.0216050289249927
especially positive were high age and many years , in private practice , after licensing .    2.3263650584349023
therapeutic UNK and attitudes divided the therapist group in three subgroups , one of which was characterized by purely classical psychoanalytic views on the values of support , UNK etc .    2.099602273956467
it is concluded that psychoanalysis and psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy are qualitatively different .    2.1741452243506
experimental studies and open clinical trials have suggested intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) as a potentially effective treatment of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) .    2.48897757682597
the austrian immunoglobulin in multiple sclerosis ( aims ) study tested this assumption by examining UNK patients with relapsing - remitting ms in a randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled fashion ( 75 ivig , 73 placebo ) .    2.0368935422817245
monthly administration of ivig in a dosage of 0 . 15 - 0 . 20 g / kg over a period of 2 years slowed the progression of or even reversed disability as evident in a total of 24 % of patients and almost UNK the number of relapses in comparison to placebo treatment .    2.863646703851314
therapeutic efficacy was noted within the first 6 months of treatment and was not correlated to the severity of disability ( mild neurological UNK without disability to ambulatory with assistance ) at study entry .    2.4283289910980854
overall the magnitude of treatment effects of ivig was comparable to that reported for beta - interferon and UNK 1 .    2.3572927139429365
incidence , etiology and optimal treatment are ill - defined .    2.5553626528625206
between july 1995 and december 1997 , we prospectively identified 42 patients ( 36 men , six women , mean age 59 + / - 12 years ) with spontaneous coronary artery dissection among UNK consecutive angiographic examinations in which the diagnosis of coronary artery disease was established for the first time ( incidence 1 . 1 % ) .    2.679457037388835
in comparison to the remaining study population with stable angina pectoris ( 8 cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection among UNK patients ; incidence : 0 . 3 % ) , the incidence of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was significantly higher in the patient subgroups with acute myocardial infarction ( 13 / 450 ; 2 . 9 % ) and with unstable angina pectoris or postinfarction angina ( 21 / UNK ; 4 . 2 % ) .    2.760899379920587
dissection was most frequently located in the left anterior descending coronary artery ( 19 cases ) , followed by the right coronary artery ( 15 cases ) and the left circumflex coronary artery ( 8 cases ) .    3.1304327155989773
because of an ambiguous angiographic lesion appearance intravascular ultrasound imaging was performed in 13 patients to confirm the diagnosis .    2.5510604853808543
the presumed etiology of spontaneous coronary artery dissection was atherosclerotic plaque rupture in 35 cases , heavy physical exercise in four cases and hormonal influences related to pregnancy and contraception in one case .    2.0090138092762952
in two cases , no obvious risk factor could be identified .    2.4077530689665103
therapy consisted of intracoronary stenting in 24 patients ( including ten patients with acute myocardial infarction ) , coronary artery bypass grafting ( cabg ) in 8 patients and balloon angioplasty ( ptca ) in seven patients .    2.599238245646174
three patients were treated conservatively .    3.4288878826093634
many surgeons have changed to the total extraperitoneal approach ( tep ) , because they fear the consequences of a peritoneal lesion .    2.2310496447214345
method : we evaluated our results with tapp in a retrospective study , with special attention to complications caused by the approach .    2.913779696100886
we operated on 460 hernias in 390 patients in a period of 5 years .    2.610538448924539
results : complication rates and recurrence rates were similar to those after tep .    2.6094922308249493
there was a marked learning curve with decrease of both rates during the evaluated years .    2.1038934543140697
there were no complications related to the transabdominal approach other than trocar hernias , the rate of which could be reduced by eliminating the learning curve and by using smaller trocar diameter .    2.439749902737596
conclusion : we see no reason to change from tapp to the tep technique .    2.093896421958303
this article examines the use and acceptance of ticket machines , automatic UNK machines ( atms ) and telephone cards by the elderly in four european regions .    1.9514688314156303
the analyses are based on data from an international project entitled " keeping the elderly mobile " , collected in mannheim ( former west germany ; n = 404 home - dwelling respondents ) , chemnitz ( former east germany ; n = 400 ) , UNK ( italy ; n = 600 ) , and UNK ( finland ; n = 618 ) .    2.2832187508659314
the random sample was stratified by age and gender in each country .    2.185293648907447
two generations of men and women ( aged 55 - 74 and 75 + years , respectively ) participated in the study .    2.2081145226925356
results show that respondents generally made little use of the three technologies under investigation : in fact , the majority of respondents does not use them at all .    2.6573690324855064
the most frequently used devices were atms in chemnitz and ticket machines and telephone cards in mannheim .    1.9730490712002458
on the basis of logistic regression analysis , age was the most important explanatory factor for the three technologies and for all four regions , i . e . , the users were mostly the " young - old . "    2.403709948937341
education was a more important variable than gender .    2.646129890612146
in all four regions , the majority of the respondents who used the technologies assessed felt that each of them made life easier ; nevertheless , ticket machines make life more difficult to almost every third user in mannheim .    1.97327529945765
interesting differences and similarities among the UNK were also found .    2.75957407654813
the present study exhibits preliminary results regarding elderly and technology which future research should investigate in greater depth .    1.9727266473135
in order to examine the efficacy of whole body acupuncture additionally applied to drug treatment in depression , a single - blind placebo - controlled study with 70 inpatients administered to three different treatment groups has been carried out .    2.3349932842046894
all patients were UNK treated with the UNK antidepressant mianserin .    3.2018677901829036
the verum group ( n = 22 ) received acupuncture at specific points considered to be effective in the treatment of depression .    2.982172892643431
the placebo group ( n = 24 ) was treated with acupuncture at non - specific locations and the control group ( n = 24 ) received only pharmacological treatment .    2.9471479346050833
acupuncture was applied three times a week over a period of four weeks .    2.786438091631995
psychopathology was rated by judges blind to verum / placebo conditions twice a week over eight weeks with the cgi , gas , UNK and UNK rating scales .    2.186856124835337
additionally applied acupuncture improved the course of depression more than pharmacological treatment with mianserin did by itself .    2.2984531173162335
however , we could not detect any differences between placebo and verum acupuncture .    2.319778787854042
acute heart failure consists of decompensated chronic heart failure , acute pulmonary edema and cardiogenic shock .    2.4228853822258243
while decompensated heart failure shows little therapeutic difficulties therapy of pulmonary edema is more sophisticated .    2.1870361260108266
cardiogenic shock , however is still a therapeutic challenge .    2.8502513769627416
for therapy of cardiogenic shock positive UNK , phosphodiesterase - inhibitors and various assist devices are currently in use .    2.2214894301632917
if it is not possible to correct underlying diseases , mortality of cardiogenic shock is still high .    2.982368114688707
two years after the diagnosis of UNK syndrome , a 50 - year old female patient experienced attacks of painful ischemia of both hands and feet , leading to acral necrosis .    2.914171758245356
another 59 - year old patient presented with severe pain in his feet , secondary to ischemia .    2.8453321557693623
this was the first symptom of a t - cell - chronic lymphocytic leukemia .    2.838357475626199
similar cases have only occasionally been described .    2.7071387961815905
the relationship between acral ischemia and t - cell - lymphoma is not clear but is discussed in this article .    2.8462363390340584
the clinical features of progression sensorineural hearing loss and vertigo in UNK - tion with the radiologic finding of a contrast - enhancing mass within the inner auditory canal are suggestive of an acoustic neuroma .    2.317157583779625
we report our findings in a 57 - year - old woman with known mixed connective tissue disease who was presumed to have a neuroma .    2.414279058885411
a large malignant lymphoma of the cerebellopontine angle presented clinically with a primary acoustic none palsy and no other central neurological deficits .    2.1610593997915197
both the primary radiological examinations and the exclusively peripheral nerve palsy failed to indicate UNK of a lymphoma .    2.40921001497922
the development of a progressive facial palsy within 8 weeks of presentation and an UNK - UNK occipital headache were uncommon findings for an acoustic neuroma .    2.6027438875296984
such changes in symptoms despite the occurrence of car - UNK symptoms require further diagnostic measures .    2.513650380625411
manifestations of a malignant lymphoma in the cerebellopontine angle are extremely rare .    2.723003400110403
to our knowledge a case of an intracerebral lymphoma in a patient with sjögren ' s syndrome has never been reported before .    2.8248527898850653
cutaneous blisters on a corpse are not only of forensic interest regarding their etiology and genesis but also the time of origin , particularly the problem of vital , UNK , UNK or postmortem occurrence of cutaneous blisters could be of forensic value .    2.58541377005177
the aim of this work was to summarize the causative spectrum of cutaneous blisters , including UNK plants and animals , drugs and toxic substances .    2.115421168039612
the time of origin of cutaneous blisters were evaluated in selected UNK relevant cases .    2.8094448727998462
the purpose of the present study was to compare two sedation regimens with either propofol ( p ) or methohexital ( m ) for elective magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in children with respect to safety , side effects , recovery , and discharge time .    2.490716115893789
pharmacological thrombolysis is a valuable therapeutic modality for embolic arterial occlusion .    2.50545864049032
nevertheless , thorough evaluation of the indications is imperative to avoid serious complications .    2.6146864913459926
the most frequent complication is hemorrhage .    2.6666940082000417
of these , the intracerebral hemorrhages are rare , but when they do occur they are an immediate threat to life they are accompanied by very severe complications , and they have an extremely poor prognosis .    2.192836145139084
within 58 months 361 patients were treated at our neurosurgical clinic with intracerebral hematomas .    2.51918930196429
in 22 patients ( 6 . 1 % ) the hematoma developed as a complication of systemic thrombolysis .    3.0589274197013063
two of these patients had been treated for occlusion of the central retinal artery .    3.687691424473425
one patient died : the other survived but was severely disabled .    2.2548705648957372
the latter patient experienced no benefit from the thrombolysis as for as the underlying ophthalmologic disease was concerned .    2.25322220317579
these UNK examples stress the necessity for careful evaluation of risk factors and the natural history of the underlying disease for which systemic thrombolysis is indicated .    2.5487956463615706
local selective ( or UNK ) thrombolysis is preferable to the systemic procedure , provided that the indications are equally strictly observed and are less likely to lead to severe complications .    2.2732761800857304
we report on a 61 - year - old patient with considerable insufficiency of a quadricuspid aortic valve and coronary three vessel disease .    2.1973035831490586
the congenital quadricuspid aortic valve has become symptomatic due to the development of ( post - UNK ) insufficiency only in the advanced stage of life .    3.0929331900517054
it was treated by replacement of the aortic valve and bypass myocardial revascularization .    2.7902551467645864
the physiopathology of quadricuspid aortic valve will be discussed .    2.3754651445499197
due to its high prevalence , atopic dermatitis is an important problem in the dermatologic practice .    2.8769940233853117
the chronicity of the disease together with numerous triggering factors of varying individual impact create a complex situation which is difficult to manage under the current circumstances in our health care system .    2.1938333957341776
we describe the concept of an outpatient clinic especially for atopic dermatitis as established in our department of dermatology .    2.603861041698665
a high degree of standardization is combined with a high measure of individual care .    2.9544050709838876
abstract : traumatic cerebral aneurysms are rare in severely head - injured patients .    2.3167737580525563
we present the first case of a traumatic aneurysm of the a1 / UNK junction .    2.8209334955143675
purpose : although the relationship between optic pits and macular lesions was described nearly a century ago , the pathology and pathogenesis of macular detachment remain unclear .    2.1706901800738585
none of the hypotheses of pathogenesis proposed so far could have been proven .    2.3852858398755106
besides the hypothesis of UNK , the role of the vitreoretinal interface is kept in the background of discussion .    3.183415914916672
we describe a case of macular detachment associated with optic UNK that regained full vision after pars plana vitrectomy with laser coagulation and gas tamponade over a follow - up of 26 months .    2.099068936834907
the purpose of our case report is to emphasize the role of the vitreoretinal interface in the pathogenesis of macular detachment associated with optic pits .    2.5654374339386488
sclerosing adenosis of the prostate is a benign lesion , which was not recognized until a few years ago .    2.719539151810548
as in sclerosing adenosis of the breast , a background of various hyperplastic changes is commonly also present in the prostate .    2.3039635353899426
an incidence of 2 . 8 % was reported in one series of resected hyperplastic prostatic glands .    2.869574028730419
as demonstrated in this case report , the main problem lies in the differential diagnosis between sclerosing adenosis and highly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the prostate .    2.921638076051883
histological diagnosis of sclerosing adenosis based on routine he sections is supplemented by immunohistochemical methods .    2.0888579336797712
important diagnostic criteria of sclerosing adenosis are the presence of basal cell differentiation , which is demonstrated by cytokeratin UNK , and signs of possible myoepithelial differentiation , with expression of s - 100 and / or smooth muscle actin .    2.968323828444279
these antibody expressions are lacking with in the presence of adenocarcinoma of the prostate .    2.661579024433332
nevertheless , in a small number of cases this differential diagnosis remains impossible , even after the application of immunohistochemical methods .    2.985567246990091
further studies are needed to shed some light on the relations between sclerosing adenosis , atypical adenomatous hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma of the prostate .    2.1532301347527953
benign intracavitary cardiac tumors lead to " malignant " complications , so early diagnosis and adequate treatment are of vital importance .    2.185972079002182
our investigation summarizes a 10 - year experience after surgical treatment of 29 patients suffering from benign intracavitary cardiac tumors .    2.765310603459683
the postoperative histological examination revealed a myxoma in 27 cases ; in 2 cases a papillary fibroelastoma was diagnosed .    2.4088931303385865
the main symptom in 19 patients was dyspnea .    2.7449793570783916
in 8 cases an embolic event occurred .    2.5868911132033916
early mortality was 10 % , while late mortality was 4 % .    2.705566330928631
the treatment of choice of benign intracavitary cardiac tumors is extirpation , which , due to unpredictable embolic complications , is to be carried out immediately should the tumor have a lobulated tuberous surface .    2.4008650534334786
in such cases the descriptive function of echocardiography is of considerable importance .    2.1913131176785767
we present a case of a 48 year old man who complained of progressive UNK .    2.748056589907207
radiograph revealed a large tumor in the left lung .    3.5227752827844125
biopsy was performed and revealed beneath a normal bronchial epithelium UNK tumor cells UNK with some histiocytes .    2.226700624800883
these tumor cells were strongly pigmented and expressed hmb - 45 and protein s - 100 immunohistochemically .    2.406724281814725
a thoracotomy and left lower lobe resection was performed .    2.581891815442943
the lung is an uncommon localisation of UNK with so far three reported cases .    2.721135336586751
lipoma , leiomyoma and UNK have to be included in the differential diagnosis .    3.143272076192118
the peculiarity of this case is the presence of multiple pigmented tumor cells that express hmb - 45 .    2.706816857206569
this has not been reported yet .    3.2393111868442133
background : the maximum number of cell divisions of a certain cell population is genetically fixed so that aging cells become non - dividing ( senescent ) at least .    1.912494147178586
this UNK life span , also known as " hayflick limit " , is probably defined by a " critical " length of the telomeres .    2.3378084978505873
telomeres are special dna - sequences located at the four ends of the chromosomes which are shortened with each cell cycle .    2.1334376452585633
cells of most , but not all malignant tumours have been shown to UNK the enzyme telomerase so that telomeres can be reconstructed , " hayflick limit " can be overcome , and unlimited cell division can be established .    2.322374575249106
this study was undertaken to elucidate whether telomerase UNK is used by uveal melanoma cells .    2.2901867379012195
a total of 113 patients with acute and chronic instability of the ulnar collateral ligament metacarpal phalangeal ( mp ) joint of the thumb were treated surgically between 1980 and 1985 ; 82 patients were followed up after a mean period of 10 years .    2.346916207342175
of 59 patients with acute injuries , 52 were painfree with full stability of the mp joint ; 23 patients with chronic instability and tendon grafting also showed restoration of stability .    2.3480925194568827
nevertheless , the range of motion was reduced severely and opposition of the thumb was impaired .    2.3925104798338332
the results of follow - up reveal that acute reattachment of the injured ulnar collateral ligament is more effective .    2.6899107977691963
the purpose of this study was to assess the role of spiral computed tomography ( sct ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) in the preoperative work - up of patients with pancreatic carcinoma , regarding local resectability and vascular involvement .    2.7840287851802143
methods and materials : a total of 28 patients ( 19 men and 9 women ; mean age 58 years ) with known or highly suspected carcinoma of the pancreas were included in this study .    2.7933208331237216
all patients prospectively underwent mri ( + / - gadolinium - dtpa ) and sct ( 3 - phase examination ) as preoperative diagnostic imaging studies , and laparotomy was carried out within 7 days , irrespective of the mri or sct findings .    2.375970826188989
sct and mr studies were reviewed independently by two radiologists , without knowing the results of the surgical exploration .    2.631168057944066
standardized image analysis was correlated with findings at laparatomy .    2.4826029552714957
results : laparotomy identified 10 patients to be suitable for surgical resection and 18 pancreatic carcinomas to be unresectable .    2.3048545722388094
in 17 of 18 non - resectable carcinomas mri and sct were able to obtain correct information about UNK ( sensitivity 94 % ) , in 7 ( mri ) , resp .    2.5835679145853216
8 ( sct ) carcinomas were correctly considered to be resectable ( sensitivity 70 % for mri and 80 % for sct ) .    2.46414324817542
the presence of vascular involvement was depicted by sct with a sensitivity of 82 - 100 % and 62 - 100 % by mri .    2.37651224261451
the specificity varied between 85 - 100 % for sct and 77 - 100 % for mri .    2.622554503199236
conclusion : both mri and sct are good techniques for the preoperative work - up of pancreatic carcinomas in order to obtain a correct assessment of local resectability .    2.6491901423059634
pancreatic pseudocysts occur as a complication in the natural course of acute or chronic pancreatitis , with a spontaneous resolution rate of 40 % to 60 % .    2.818865430340322
the incidence of pseudocysts in the course of chronic pancreatitis amounts to 60 % .    2.863940465356802
pseudocysts have to be differentiated from neoplastic or congenital pancreatic cystic lesions .    2.6874243509801907
careful diagnostic work - up including ercp and ct scanning is mandatory in the management of pancreatic pseudocysts .    2.4353870158766093
the indication for treatment depends on the development of symptoms or complications .    3.5005559015145282
pain is present in up to 90 % of all patients , and the rate of complications varies between 2 % and 55 % .    3.7769418158680437
pancreatic pseudocysts are usually an UNK of chronic pancreatitis .    3.132499315218398
new percutaneous and endoscopic techniques for draining pseudocysts are challenging the previous UNK of the surgeon .    2.650501031098337
however , so far no prospectively collected data are available comparing the results of interventional and surgical drainage procedures .    2.5270403651607465
therefore , in most symptomatic cases surgery is considered the treatment of choice .    2.8192174016110543
a 28 - year - old drug UNK who had injected intravenously died of hepatic failure and coma caused by fulminant hepatitis ( simultaneously : hepatitis a , persistent hepatitis b , hepatitis c and superinfection by delta hepatitis ) .    1.9269565410138765
liver histology disclosed cirrhosis with severe necrotizing hepatitis and extensive UNK UNK , compatible with a delta virus infection .    2.3005692434585487
moderate pulmonary fat embolism ( grade i - ii according to UNK ) was accompanied by fat deposits in alveolar macrophages .    2.833836595621029
it is postulated that protracted fat mobilization from necrotizing UNK may be the cause of pulmonary fat embolism ; the extravasation of fat from the vessels into the alveoli results in UNK by alveolar macrophages .    2.198910730909364
suicide on railways ( either by being run over by or jumping in front of a train ) is one of the ' UNK ' suicide methods .    2.2087226040589365
in austria , UNK suicides or attempted suicides on railways were registered between 1990 and 1994 .    2.1335654498374557
this amounts to 5 . 73 % of all suicides committed in this period with women showing a higher percentage than men .    2.450761048261627
in both men and women there was a predominance of younger age groups ; the mean age was higher in women than in men ( 48 . 0 vs 40 . 4 years ) .    2.5979214253132743
there was a significant increase in suicides or attempted suicides on railways after a television report on the stress suffered by train drivers concerning possible suicides .    2.00036707283605
UNK the mass media to treat the subject of ' suicide ' with reserve and with greater caution , even when not presenting a distinct suicide model , may be of importance in general suicide prevention .    2.201298620339489
for decades the results of elective lymph node dissection ( elnd ) are differently discussed , so that it is not definitely recommended at present the less so since the morbidity of this operation can ' t be neglected .    2.4300906437901713
since the beginning of 1995 we practice a gamma - probe guided sentinel UNK ( slne ) on patients with melanoma from a breslow tumor thickness of 1 mm upward , after UNK a UNK 99m - tc labelled tin ( ii ) - UNK solution around the tumor or the scar , if the tumor has been UNK before .    2.020731849219536
by this method , that allows a selection of patients who according clinically to a stage i or ii ( uicc ) but even histopathologically to a stage iii and who are UNK of a removal of the regional lymph nodes , the sentinel node can be exactly localised , tissue - sparing removed at minimal complication rates and the completeness of the removal can be verified by measurements of the radioactivity .    2.304435082675263
when finding metastases in the histopathological examination of the node a dissection of the whole region follows .    2.7768421687597584
during rehabilitation of patients suffering from a recent hip fracture , we evaluated the development of several aspects of their subjective well - being ( n = 87 , age : 70 to 94 ) .    2.894566023387315
when discharged , the subjective well - being of our patients was comparable to the well - being of similar - aged people living at home .    2.8461682897751612
antidepressants are used in demented patients for treating depressive symptoms as well as other non - cognitive symptoms including agitation , aggression and UNK .    2.429437274311181
as patients are usually elderly , a dose adjustment is mandatory for all classes of antidepressants .    2.207365865496717
new antidepressants such as the UNK and the reversible UNK inhibitors should be the first - line agents in these patients , because their efficacy is not different from that of classic UNK , but they have advantages regarding frequency of adverse effects , ease of use and safety .    2.828891052817984
improvement in cognitive performance , however , may not be expected from the new antidepressants .    3.133147562437012
for the treatment of agitation , aggression and UNK , UNK and benzodiazepines are in frequent use , although their adverse effects are particularly problematic in demented patiens .    2.5843124819892633
good alternatives are the antidepressant trazodone and citalopram .    2.3503838804269352
all medications mentioned have been studied on small patient samples , so treatment recommendations must be given cautiously .    2.15675592726777
the application of laser energy to joint capsular tissues resulted in the reduction of the joint capsule .    2.9250784305080724
primary clinical results of combined laser - assisted capsular shrinkage ( lacs ) and multiple suture repair ( caspari ) for arthroscopic stabilization procedure of anterior shoulder instability are presented .    2.1012833974210934
from july 1997 to october 1998 , 18 patients ( 2 female , 16 male ; mean age 27 . 9 years ; range 16 - 42 years ) with anterior instability and recurrent dislocations of the shoulder received a combined arthroscopic stabilization procedure .    2.4058776072555075
the operative technique involved the use of UNK sutures to repair the labrum and shift the capsule ( caspari ) and lacs .    2.227919422842697
laser energy was applied using a ho : yag laser ( 10 w , 1 j , 10 pulses / s , total energy : 1500 - 2000 j ) .    1.9006132279152992
the patients were followed for an average of 9 months ( range 4 - 20 months ) .    2.921051759797649
from june 1992 to UNK 1996 , arthroscopic suture stabilization without laser shrinkage was performed on 17 patients ( 2 female , 15 male ; age 25 . 9 years / range 18 - 37 years ) .    2.1511085921832827
the average follow - up in this group was 4 . 5 years ( range 2 - 5 . 5 years ) , and we found 41 . 2 % ( 7 / 17 ) recurrent dislocations .    3.741122273880055
after combined arthroscopic procedure of multiple suture repair ( caspari ) and lacs , a significantly ( chi - squared test , p = 0 . 05 ) lower recurrence rate was obtained .    2.2049552112942146
only in one patient ( 5 . 6 % , 1 / 18 ) did we find this failure .    3.032729494292594
no complications occurred in either group .    2.5037074303386326
the combination of arthroscopic lacs and caspari ' s technique of multiple suture repair in cases of posttraumatic anterior shoulder instability and recurrent dislocations is promising .    2.4057170936635766
although , no long - term results are available , the method seems to be suitable for UNK low recurrence rates with the advantages of arthroscopic surgery .    2.9529760892459893
simple bone cysts are asymptomatic , benign lesions which are usually an incidental finding on a radiograph .    2.2400421204274377
etiology and treatment are controversially discussed .    3.0049835282422586
the UNK status of the calcaneus and possible pathologic fracturing lead many authors to recommend therapeutic measures after diagnosis has been made .    2.2617358618115637
we present a case report of an intact UNK bone cyst of the calcaneus concomitant with tibial and talar fractures following crush trauma .    2.2647757494467524
several types of treatment for simple bone cysts of the calcaneus have been suggested .    2.63965814718647
the question whether treatment is UNK necessary is controversially discussed .    2.358899170839685
it is the author ' s opinion , that asymptomatic bone cysts of the calcaneus require no further treatment .    2.182672378297935
facial neuromyography is an objective electrophysiologic measurement used to assess prognosis for recovery from facial paralysis .    2.1831102710848915
in the present study variability over time of the amplitude ratio in healthy subjects was investigated .    2.5725207230896396
twenty healthy subjects underwent four UNK tests at intervals of one week .    2.275497776584872
the study group consisted of 12 males and 8 females .    2.5583337531765498
the stimulation intensity required for UNK stimulation was 14 . 6 ma on average .    2.5577752977072574
the mean of the intra - individual side - to - side difference of the evoked compound action potential was 32 . 5 % .    2.3230807107880604
results of the four repeated tests ranged from no to 80 % side - to - side differences in the same individual .    2.8557667815423313
the hypothesis of symmetrical evoked facial compound potentials was not supported by our data .    2.2047897559023726
as with previous investigators we found significant side - to - side differences in healthy subjects .    2.504682195560202
furthermore , we could also show for the first time that the amplitude ratio was not constant in every individual at repeated measurements .    2.2815297519386326
we conclude that there is a physiological variability that must be taken into account in the interpretation of facial nerve neuromyography .    2.590241500704101
to compare patient dose and image quality of electron - beam - ct vs . spiral - ct by means of phantom measurements .    2.414515903952533
an ebct scanner ( c - 150 UNK ) and a spiral - ct scanner ( ge UNK advantage ) were used to scan three different UNK .    2.5406539026622723
administered dose , high contrast ( hc ) resolution , low contrast ( lc ) lesion detectability and the width of the radiation beams were measured .    2.0258354070204203
ebct showed 25 - 35 % lower hc resolution in comparison to spiral - ct . lc lesion detectability showed equivalent results for s / n vs . patient dose using 3 mm collimation with ebct and spiral - ct , whereas spiral - ct was superior for 1 , 5 and 6 mm collimation .    2.2213031764011624
dose measurements revealed a 2 fold higher patient dose using ebct with 1 , 5 mm or 6 mm collimation compared to spiral - ct using equivalent scan parameters .    2.233822483435565
no differences were seen using 3 mm collimation .    2.52744011724138
differences were due to insufficient UNK collimation of the ebct .    2.5040027985136377
the use of ebct with 6 mm collimation should be avoided , because of impaired performance .    2.743234228338823
using 3 mm collimation , ebct showed comparable performance like state of the art spiral - ct despite lower hc resolution .    2.272224848306695
in an experimental study , the biomechanical qualities of the combined kirschner wire osteosynthesis ( kwo ) in the unstable colles ' fracture were analyzed .    2.386350038597574
this type of pin fixation is our preferred osteosynthesis in the treatment of unstable colles ' fracture because it allows immediate functional therapy .    2.4614128024748196
it represents a modification of UNK ' s dynamic kwo , UNK for the insufficient volar stability by means of the conventional static kwo .    2.716832155125925
clinical experience according to the anatomical and functional results , was very encouraging suggesting that a clinical concept based on the biomechanical principles of combined kwo and its single components should be UNK .    2.7020343019865964
simulation of the unstable colles ' fracture was realized by dorsal wedge osteotomy of the distal end of the radius using cadaveric material .    2.510632932602794
the combined kwo UNK the advantage of volar stability of the conventional kwo with the high dorsal stability of dynamic kwo .    2.5790202024745215
the main functional principle of dynamic kwo with regard to its axial stability consists in the repositioning of the dorsal bone fragmentation zone and hence the reconstitution of cortical load transmission .    2.1429488117841324
besides its good stabilization , dynamic kwo also leads to optimal alignment of the distal metaphyseal fragment .    2.314317415821623
based on these experimental findings , the surgical technique of combined kwo was standardized .    2.708444840294986
purpose : it is difficult to measure the topography of the cornea with high resolution and visualize it on a map UNK refraction .    2.3246703173298986
this is demonstrated by the ongoing improvement and further development of different methods and by the fact that users of these techniques are not always satisfied .    2.78350419941791
we present the case of a 2 - year - old boy who was brought to hospital with extensive UNK of the face .    3.0497307660070754
the clinicians raised the suspicion of a physical maltreatment of the child .    2.554555988038319
because of the morphological findings the medico - legal expert came to the conclusion that maltreatment was proven .    2.2654967015997007
during the criminal proceedings at the UNK court contrary opinions on the morphological findings of the injury between the clinical expert and the medico - legal expert became obvious .    2.4280215001331626
findings of the physical examination of the child and the experimental studies on immersion and UNK of water and the influence of UNK in case of wetting with hot water were presented which confirmed that the injury was caused by maltreatment .    3.025784896951544
the opinion of the clinical expert which supported the case of the accused could be UNK .    2.805748096672811
during the final legal proceedings the opinions of the clinical expert had been sufficient for the court to justify an UNK " in UNK pro UNK " .    2.305258843942559
anterior thoracoscopic interbody stabilization and fusion was performed in 163 patients .    2.896759313621517
lesions treated were located between t4 and l3 , most frequently occuring at UNK / l2 .    2.1363444308571755
operative time decreased dramatically as experience was gained with the procedure .    2.22706054074831
2 patients early in the series successfully were converted to an open procedure .    2.3342674579800224
one positioning related pressure harm on the UNK nerve and one irritation of the UNK root at the entrance site were both UNK .    2.615351103898491
postoperative control by x - ray and UNK showed correct positioning of the bone graft , as well as the fixation device in all patients .    3.1946846237582838
our experience with this minimally invasive procedure demonstrated the feasibility of the method .    2.971437013987169
major advantages compared to the open procedure are reduced morbidity of the approach , postoperative pain reduction , early recovery of function and shortened hospital stay .    2.41633405164748
in order to restore function and UNK in mandibular hypoplasia , transplantation of osteochondral grafts and the distraction osteogenesis technique are used alternatively .    2.350961303056108
in a retrospective study the indication , growth and complication rate of osteochondral graft and distraction osteogenesis cases in mandibular hypoplasia were compared .    2.282124923764868
in total , 12 patients ( 4 - 14 years old ; 7 female , 5 male ) with different grades of mandibular hypoplasia received osteochondral grafts ( 7 costochondral , 5 iliac crest ; observation period 4 - 9 years ) .    2.218149392827196
in 5 patients ( 10 - 12 years old ; 1 female , 4 male ) , distraction osteogenesis was performed ( observation period 10 months to 3 1 / 2 years ) .    2.391109345839846
in the results , according to the literature , the range of growth after osteochondral grafting varied considerably , approximate normal growth was noticed in only two cases .    2.6117486891356445
on the other hand , all patients treated by distraction osteogenesis showed a stable increase of bone length as expected .    2.4063945704027896
after osteochondral grafts , adequate growth is to be expected in the minority of cases and it does not seem predictable in individual cases .    2.497597405964507
therefore , the indication for osteochondral grafts should be restricted to severe hypoplasia , where the local amount of bone does not allow the use of a distraction device , and to cases where support of the mandibula at the skull base is necessary .    2.5360205127218816
in all other cases of mandibular hypoplasia in children , distraction osteogenesis should be discussed as the primary option , even if in the long term a second surgical procedure should be UNK .    2.5904612320669287
to evaluate the predictive value of mri in the early postoperative course after cruciate ligament replacement , a prospective study was performed .    3.0527846330021577
twenty patients with reconstructed anterior and / or posterior cruciate ligament were examined clinically and with contrast - enhanced mri 2 , 12 , 24 weeks , 1 and 2 years postoperatively .    2.615572648100608
the clinical examinations were evaluated according to the scores by lysholm , oak and ikdc .    2.4351552023362233
during the first postoperative year a significant increase in signal intensity and UNK of the neoligament in mri was observed in 16 patients with an average value for signal / noise of 1 . 1 2 weeks postoperatively up to 6 . 9 1 year postoperatively .    3.0875819767782073
in 12 patients the reconstructed ligament could not be evaluated in the 1 - year postoperative mri , whereas none of these patients was suspected clinically of having instability .    2.7273202918675734
in the 2 - year postoperative mri , the signal intensity of the neoligament was found to be decreasing again with improvement in judgement .    2.542256767581398
miniplate osteosynthesis is a standard method for the surgical treatment of mandible fractures today .    3.0071926810037897
apart from easy handling , in the majority of cases it also ensures adequate fracture stability .    2.657901268678581
the treatment of fractures of very atrophic mandibles as well as mandibular defects and comminuted fractures with miniplates and rigid plates is often difficult or only possible to an inadequate extent .    2.3797731676322313
titanium mesh has proved successful for the treatment of such fractures .    3.043175417561148
compared with conventional miniplates this mesh is outstanding for its considerably higher stability due to its given geometry .    2.215208231467347
the titanium mesh can be adapted and UNK individually in any situation , in contrast to miniplates and rigid plates .    2.2861067802126698
as a result , complications such as fracture gap infections and pseudoarthrosis can be avoided to a great extent .    2.298320393411501
non - invasive methods to identify absent or persistent myocardial viability have gained increasing importance in the therapeutic management and risk stratification of patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction .    2.5993593341547303
myocardial scintigraphy using thallium - 201 and positron emission tomography with metabolic imaging of myocardial glucose metabolism , using UNK - 18 UNK - UNK , are today the most widely used nuclear methods for the assessment of myocardial viability .    2.627913598203672
besides the prediction of reversible regional and global myocardial dysfunction following coronary revascularization , both methods have demonstrated the ability to identify patient subgroups who will benefit most with regard to cardiac prognosis and survival and those patients in whom coronary revascularization has a limited effect with regard to survival and cardiac events .    2.283829230219773
this short review summarizes the clinical impact of both imaging modalities on UNK diagnostic approach in patients with ischemic left ventricular dysfunction .    2.375006687331836
an elderly woman was found dead in her farm house UNK in a pool of blood and was partially UNK .    2.3391563300055114
blood was also discovered in several rooms on the first floor .    2.4740928724203757
the investigation at the scene led to the conclusion of a sexual UNK .    2.8216632804195427
the autopsy however revealed the source of the hemorrhage to be a renal artery aneurysm which had ruptured in the adjacent renal pelvis .    2.43999341588194
the woman has obviously been UNK by the sudden bleeding which produced the impressive pattern of blood stains on the floor and finally a fatal hemorrhage .    2.0792182019415373
a similar case of a ruptured renal artery aneurysm and bleeding to death via the urinary tract has not yet been described .    2.6805647519550244
in the ankle ( talocrural ) joint , the lower end of the tibia and fibula UNK the trochlea tali .    2.5987403182474194
thus , an approximately UNK joint is formed which permits dorsiflexion and plantarflexion of the foot against the leg .    2.1598127611405356
due to the geometry of the trochlea tali , UNK lateral rotation of the fibula against the tibia occurs at the tibiofibular articulations synchronously with active dorsiflexion at the ankle joint .    2.04803115554378
movements at the talocrural joints are mainly limited by the opposing muscles as well as by strong collateral ligaments .    2.5118238530252013
talus and calcaneus form a functional unit connected by posterior and anterior articulations .    2.181022948292241
the posterior articulation is the subtalar ( UNK ) joint ; in the anterior articulation , talar UNK of the calcaneus together with the posterior surface of the UNK and the superior fibrocartilaginous surface of the plantar UNK ligament form a concavity for the talar head .    2.9921945840881743
thus , the UNK joint is a compound and - like the subtalar joint - a UNK articulation .    2.7510008829029275
on the weight - bearing foot , the distal UNK and UNK are UNK and UNK against the talus in order to maintain UNK contact .    3.698873754149465
when the foot is off the ground , these movements are modified to eversion and inversion , also involving the calcaneocuboid joint .    1.9218272772529637
in addition , movements between the calcaneus and cuboid also occur during UNK or UNK changes between the fore - and hindfoot .    2.3076594455991275
limitation of movements is due to leg muscles as well as strong ligaments .    2.998795624471816
finally , the UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK joints permit some additional alterations of the loaded foot in contact with the ground .    3.295636675492022
a case of primary splenic angiosarcoma with involvement of two accessory spleens is presented .    2.124781486878358
the tumor cells are immunoreactive for endothelial markers ( cd 31 , cd 34 , factor viii associated antigen ) and express also histiocytic antigens ( cd 68 , lysozyme , cathepsin d , alpha - 1 - UNK , alpha - 1 - UNK ) as well as cd 8 .    2.3615164030835003
this marker profile suggests that the presented angiosarcoma originates from sinus cells with histiocytic and endothelial differentiation and may be regarded as the malignant variant of UNK cells angioma .    2.463328039428355
despite major advances in knowledge and development of efficient techniques for pain control , many patients on surgical wards suffer from modest to severe pain following surgery or trauma .    2.0891162037001925
therefore , in the university hospital of kiel , germany , an anaesthesiology - based acute pain service ( aps ) was started in 1985 to improve this situation .    2.280467614848404
the anaesthesiologist in training who UNK the recovery unit serves as an aps for surgical wards and is supervised by a UNK .    2.424918520517007
the UNK on call are responsible after regular working hours .    2.3318100040016922
the activities of the aps are as follows : 1 .    2.6846605016664484
induction of sufficient postoperative analgesia in the recovery unit for all surgical patients .    2.5877086159182845
clinical UNK on all patients receiving epidural analgesia ( ea ) , other forms of regional analgesia , or patient - controlled analgesia ( pca ) every morning and throughout the day if necessary .    2.048219275526252
additional consultations for postoperative pain management for other patients on request .    2.5371945506175164
assessment and documentation of the clinical status of the patient , quality of analgesia , and side effects .    3.915519964240588
writing orders for further treatment .    2.8915466879390097
continuing consultations and UNK education for ward nurses , physiotherapists , and surgical staff ; formal medical training for ward nurses in postoperative pain management .    2.177443836686369
from 1985 to 1992 , 1947 patients on normal wards were treated ( ea : UNK , pca : 183 ) .    2.0430319920684656
epidural analgesia was performed using a standard protocol with bupivacaine 0 . 175 % - 0 . 25 % infused continuously with top - ups if needed ( mean 240 mg / day , range 75 - 600 mg ; median duration 7 days , range 1 - 53 , table 1 ) .    2.094721958338322
demand for further treatment was proved by day - to - day withdrawal .    2.7614585075938076
since the introduction of an aps , complications of ea such as hypotension ( 1985 / 1986 : 5 . 1 % ; 1987 / 1992 : 0 . 5 % , table 3 ) and insufficient analgesia due to dislocation or other technical complications could be reduced significantly ( table 3 ) .    2.371157507819117
dermal infections were seen in 2 . 6 % of patients , with a significantly higher incidence in patients with arteriosclerotic diseases ( 4 . 1 % ) .    4.185371606626183
epidural opioids were used in only 46 selected cases on surgical wards .    2.4883534711730215
nevertheless , 2 cases of marked respiratory depression occurred .    2.4911088375311796
the overall risk of complications during postoperative ea could be reduced from 1 : 11 cases in the first 2 years to 1 : 20 in the last 6 years since introducing the aps .    2.4587593347340957
pca was performed using a standard protocol with tramadol or piritramide without background infusion ( table 6 ) .    2.1032930486905577
the loading dose was titrated in the recovery unit .    2.5185234503415277
the median duration of pca was 4 days ( range 1 - 23 ) ; the median dose of piritramide was 45 mg / day ( range 3 - 226 mg ) .    2.176907389708174
two cases of somnolence and respiratory depression occurred .    2.405784835603005
in this period there were 8 potential life - threatening complications due to postoperative pain therapy ; 4 occurred during standard surgical pain management ( 3 cases of severe respiratory depression after i . m .    2.331990838076586
piritramide ( UNK resuscitation ) , tramadol , and buprenorphine ; 1 small child with multiorgan failure after UNK intoxication ) .    2.058918917528232
in those cases the aps was not involved .    2.626960255827572
there are insufficient data for comparison of the incidence of complications following standard management of postoperative pain relief without an aps , i . e . , i . m .    2.8609212173054037
injections of opioids on request , but severe and sometimes lethal complications have been reported .    2.259271999910764
since the majority of patients used ea or pca for several days , it is again emphasised that these techniques should not be restricted to high - dependency areas such as intensive care or recovery units .    2.3919301234450536
the introduction of an aps is an adequate approach to more efficient and safer pain management on surgical wards .    2.0468327290208106
this requires standard protocols ( table 7 ) , standardised monitoring and trained ward nurses .    2.1113504545684276
lambdoid synostosis can manifest unilaterally , bilaterally or in combination with other UNK .    2.5739699098778144
using the concept of fronto - orbital advancement we developed occipital advancement in order to correct unilateral or bilateral lambdoid synostosis .    2.578298264671114
the process involves UNK transversal osteotomy , removal , remodelling and advancement of the occipital region .    2.091949571382118
it allows precise , reproducible and predictable positioning of the segments .    2.49340284426254
artificial sutures are created as a result of the osteotomy .    2.8745739295574197
the remodelling leads to a well - UNK skull shape and advancement to an increase in the intracranial volume .    2.854108987557528
this article presents the operative method and the results of 14 patients .    2.946935555078646
melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy is a rare neoplasm of neural crest origin .    2.550881864195139
it almost always occurs in children younger than one year of age with a predilection for the anterior maxillary ridge .    2.2349164039895766
although it usually follows a benign course , local destruction as well as metastasis and death may result from the tumor .    2.678641703389075
melanotic neuroectodermal tumor is most commonly treated by surgery .    2.495260091594738
10 - 15 % of the lesions recur .    4.2235912657378805
we report the case of a 2 - month - old infant suffering from melanotic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy of the UNK who was successfully treated with a combination of various chemotherapeutic agents in order to UNK the child a mutilating operation or the late effects of radiation .    2.742423681955305
computer - assisted techniques were introduced in spine surgery in the 1990s to improve accuracy and safety of operative procedures .    2.41178808767663
several reports on clinical results of computer - aided screw insertion in the cervical , thoracic , and lumbar spine as well as the UNK - iliac joints are available .    2.6959850650764556
they show a significant decrease of screw UNK rates as compared to conventional insertion techniques .    2.824259064405773
over the past years , antioxidants , and particularly vitamin e , have received considerable attention in the treatment of human diseases .    2.4840577159912343
in rheumatology , interest has been given to the treatment and prevention of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis .    2.9184416841908956
this paper reviews current and past studies about vitamin e in the treatment of rheumatic diseases .    2.4222789490591974
patient - controlled intravenous analgesia ( i . v . - pca ) represents the gold standard in the management of acute postoperative pain .    2.5634788670833437
however , in many countries i . v . - pca is rarely used .    2.380013594145506
recent clinical studies demonstrated that intranasal fentanyl titration provides a rapid and safe form and pain management .    2.2508384376727837
in the present study we investigated patients ' acceptance and assessment of patient - controlled intranasal analgesia ( UNK ) and compared it to intravenous pca and the UNK prescribed pain therapy .    2.776815677581572
unreamed nailing with solid tibial nails is an accepted method of treatment for open tibial shaft fractures up to grade iii and of closed tibial fractures with severe soft tissue damage .    2.181845048989957
we report a mechanical study investigating the fatigue limit of six different types of locking bolts used in solid tibial nails ( UNK tibial nail / aap , utn / ace , UNK / howmedica , UNK / howmedica , r & t tibial nail / smith & nephew , ao / asif utn / synthes ) .    1.8228859914558353
our results prove a direct correlation between the bolt ' s diameter and mechanical properties .    2.3036742463620805
further more we found that bolts with a continuing thread were UNK than bolts of the same diameter with only a short thread and an increased diameter at the nail ' s UNK .    2.2122564634594273
some of the tested locking bolts may even withstand full weight - bearing in a physiological walking cycle , but will not withstand the stress of a running cycle .    2.0260283495714866
voiding dysfunctions secondary to failure of adequate relaxation of the striated urinary sphincter or the smooth bladder neck should be considered in children with urinary day time incontinence and / or enuresis and recurrent urinary tract infections .    2.286855353657879
the urodynamic findings resemble to those obtained in neuropathic bladders , but only a minority of the children suffer from neurologic disorders or anatomical obstruction .    2.148744227821135
in the majority of cases a developmental delay of the central nervous system responsible for urinary control is assumed .    2.4480485843726827
behavioural disturbances play another important etiological role .    2.387867259303838
therapy is based on behavioural modification .    3.196771075978089
we report on two patients with granulomatous rosacea and another patient with granulomatous perioral dermatitis who responded well to dapsone .    2.075825500885376
dapsone has a pharmacological double function as both an antibiotic and an antiphlogistic drug .    2.1046050939115153
before the introduction of isotretinoin , dapsone had its place in the treatment of severe acne .    2.7423297951822634
to date , its use in granulomatous rosacea has not been described .    2.6292441859366247
when hematologic parameters are monitored , dapsone is considered a safe and cost - effective drug , especially in countries where isotretinoin is not readily available .    2.507337196132528
however , the definite value of dapsone in granulomatous rosacea should be established by a controlled study .    2.2235257660763366
anaesthesia both for adenotomy ( at ) and for UNK ( te ) frequently presents a challenge .    2.2362946255836067
on one hand , children scheduled for adenotomy often have upper airway infections and are thus at risk of UNK - and UNK ; on the other hand the ent surgeon and the anaesthetist have to share the " UNK " in the patient ' s mouth .    3.015894132873506
since the UNK UNK debate in the early 1990s , the question of the best muscle relaxant has UNK hand in hand with that of the most appropriate means of securing the airway .    2.7942944883107246
the concept of the laryngeal mask as airway was initially UNK with scepticism .    2.3293203807794978
following several years ' use of the mask for this purpose in at and te in young children , we report our experience and summarise the literature on this topic .    2.6141701027769657
the laryngeal mask represents a safe alternative to intubation , provided there is close cooperation with the ent surgeon .    2.452017804273304
topical corticosteroids ( cs ) are frequently used to treat of allergic contact dermatitis , so that their own potential for sensitization is rarely detected .    2.443647611007722
however , increasing numbers of hypersensitivity reactions to corticosteroids have been reported during the last 10 years , and allergic skin reactions to over 50 particular compounds have been observed .    2.4369306284631
cs must now be regarded as a rather frequent contact allergen , the prevalence being twice as high in women as in men .    2.278459723250125
contact allergy to cs is clinically characterized by a chronic and persistent , corticosteroid - resistant dermatitis .    2.371743304598398
in general , hypersensitivity to cs is a type i and / or type iv mediated allergic reaction .    2.6807117576095454
cross - sensitivity between individual corticosteroid preparations has been described owing to their closely related chemical structures ( e . g .    2.065286316603014
UNK and tixocortol pivalate ) .    2.5332975408110903
contact allergy to cs can be confirmed by patch - tests , intradermal injection tests or application tests ; because of the delayed appearance of positive skin reactions a prolonged evaluation period of up to 120 h is recommended .    2.094303888463301
for routine screening the use of the patient ' s own material and of tixocortol pivalate and budesonide as test marker substances seems appropriate .    2.537089739295433
the development of further marker substances is a target for ongoing research .    2.3271233045569395
the alliance concepts are defined as being the description of the dynamic interaction of all cognitive and emotional factors which promote the analytic process .    2.3428479819216195
the historical significance and the development of the three predominant alliance concepts , these being the UNK " standard alliance " of freud , UNK ' s therapeutic alliance and UNK ' s working alliance , are to be described .    2.5845800950204367
all alliance concepts refer to a general , essentially reality - oriented relationship anchored in the personal and the human domain , which forms the background for the therapeutic process and the basis for the analytic interpretation work .    2.2021667328810772
nonetheless , the dynamic force of the alliances is substantiated by factors of the transference .    2.3229649856596213
the alliances are therefore not faced with the transference , but rather with the resistance .    2.270864762968131
we report on a 15 - months - old girl with a history of recurrent UNK of the lower eyelid , UNK , UNK and mucositis together with growth - retardation , chronic obstipation and anal prolaps .    2.840270062694102
during a period of 19 days absolute neutropenia was observed .    2.427969480305048
retrospectively , neutrophil counts were between 0 - 500 / µl from birth on .    2.0539053895296036
bone marrow biopsy revealed an arrest of maturation of UNK at the stage of UNK .    2.6892229417917144
continuous therapy with 10 µg / kg / d of recombinant human UNK - colony stimulating factor ( g - csf ) induced 12 - day oscillations of blood neutrophil counts .    2.064156701701364
there were no oscillations of counts of other blood cell lines .    2.226156716677059
growth retardation and prolaps of UNK normalized , and few intercurrent bacterial infections , pneumonia and impetigo contagiosa occurred .    1.9656677929650215
a mutation in the g - csf - receptor gene was not found in this patient .    2.7455964652418303
after 2 years of therapy , a reduction of UNK - csf dose ( application every 2 days ) lead to a severe neutropenia .    3.0995221525709975
those alterations were most evident on his face and limbs .    2.378277888546167
in some locations UNK hyperkeratosis with authentic hair UNK was found .    2.1677260727894168
the histology of these alterations showed a marked hyperkeratosis of the hair follicles with formation of hair - like UNK either alone or in connection with hairs .    2.421260999556775
the presence of true hairs distinguishes our case from the morphologically similar disseminated UNK hyperkeratosis and other spiny keratinization disorders .    1.9315883537338931
scanning electron microscopy helped to demonstrate the hair - like structure of these keratoses .    2.5488013214036784
some of the sebaceous glands showed cystic widening of their UNK , which were filled with UNK UNK eosinophilic material , a finding similar to earlier observations .    2.4715341715389227
our case demonstrates that these skin alterations should be classified as side effects of cyclosporin a and that they are apparently dose - dependent .    2.3281932623217605
background : since increased intraoperative iris irritation can lead to increased postoperative inflammation , we are interested in postoperative reactions to several varied surgical procedures .    2.1167530346093733
we performed pupil UNK , iridotomy with iris suture , and partial sphincterectomy .    2.073139008992171
reports of accidental UNK - intoxications with plants of the UNK family , in particular UNK - species are well known in pediatric care .    2.6439963801311026
the intentional abuse as a hallucinogenic drug in adolescents became more frequent in recent years .    2.199578704270976
two patients , a 14 - resp .    2.9764834991599356
16 - year old boy were admitted to the intensive care units of our hospitals because of a severe central anticholinergic syndrome after ingestion of tea from UNK ' s UNK UNK for experimental reasons .    2.8030714526032456
patient ' s history in the first UNK patient was not available at the time of admission , a routine immunological drug screening of the patient ' s urine had been negative .    2.883757449624239
granular cell tumors ( abrikossoff ' s tumor ) of the esophagus are rather rare tumors of neuroectodermal benign histogenesis .    2.5621009987168732
diagnosis can be obtained by endoscopic and histological study and immunohistochemical forceps biopsy .    2.537764260937458
because of the peculiar histological feature of the tumor , it can be mistaken for an squamous cell carcinoma .    2.8647316527991165
in the guidelines for determination of the blood alcohol level for forensic purposes , a correction factor of 1 . 2 has been established for the conversion of serum alcohol into blood alcohol based on the relationship of the water content between serum and whole blood .    2.6598527024405
the reliability of the determination of the blood alcohol level is dependent on the possible minimum and maximum values of this correction factor .    2.497856803007876
in a comprehensive multicenter study consisting of UNK samples , which can be considered representative of persons involved in UNK under the drinking and driving act , an average quotient of 1 . 16 was found with minimum and maximum values of 1 . 08 and 1 . 21 respectively .    2.381442266877393
in 96 % of the cases the quotient was between 1 . 13 and 1 . 19 and the deviation of the quotient from the average value was less than 3 % .    2.6118004679734397
from these results it can be assumed that the determination of blood alcohol is obviously more reliable than previously presumed .    2.5705353206113215
in germany , if the dermatologist has definite proof that a patient ' s skin disorder is severe or chronic , work - related and requiring a change in occupation , then he or she must issue a UNK ( UNK translated as occupational disease notification ) .    2.312347531609572
the patient ' s consent is not required for this mandatory form , which has to be submitted even if the patient is opposed .    2.8725839783359253
on the other hand , if there is only a possible connection between the occupation and the skin disorder , or if the skin disease is neither severe nor chronic nor threatening UNK of the occupation , then the dermatologist needs only write a UNK ( dermatologist ' s report ) .    2.2208421466052246
the patient ' s permission is required for this less formal document .    2.488103284479705
bone marrow involvement is often observed in patients with hematological malignancies and solid tumors .    2.786185980743752
sensitive immunological and molecular biological methods allow the detection of isolated transformed cells in bone marrow samples .    2.649825555663909
like normal hematopoietic cells , tumor cells interact with bone marrow stroma through adhesion molecules .    2.159974771764773
since adhesion UNK play an essential role in the invasion and proliferation of malignant cells , new therapeutic approaches involving the inhibition of cell - cell and cell - matrix interactions are UNK .    2.2670641867478842
with the development of powerful computer systems , computer - assisted medical diagnosis and therapy have become common over the last 10 years .    2.8727706674278912
even in the surgical field , computer - and robotic - assisted techniques are becoming practical but are not yet used on a daily basis .    2.4626132175264823
in the orthopaedic field , computer and robotic assistance is used in planning and performing demanding three - dimensional osteotomies , setting pedicle screws in the spine and UNK the femoral medullary canal in total hip replacement .    2.3203276286645518
this article introduces a computer - and robotic - assisted system for performing arthroplasty in total knee replacement procedures .    2.0982042968762213
the hand is very exposed to injuries in the daily man ' s work .    2.495217484293039
the multiple functions of the hand are based on vitality , sensibility , motor function and stability .    2.5650008687536183
in severe hand injuries the functional results of the repair are often very poor .    2.981788174231522
in a complex injury of the hand we are faced with the damage of the soft tissue and bone and the loss of vitality and function of the hand .    3.1527923304240653
the cause of hand injuries are mainly a crush trauma or the rotating saw .    2.2926732281763154
basically , we recommend an extended primary repair .    2.7880527523248397
after the radical debridement we have to reconstruct the damaged structures .    2.5595616910457104
we start doing the osteosynthesis and stabilization of the joints .    2.587169151937452
thereafter , suturing of extensor and flexor tendons .    2.2783399537603377
then , we do the microsurgical reconstructions of vessels and nerves .    2.375937118687101
in case tendons and bones are exposed we have to cover the defect with a pedicled or a free flap .    2.3210821240515807
in a long ischemic time we have to change our concept and do the reconstruction of the vessels first .    2.618134315913009
our results in vitality and sensibility are listed .    2.311146052425625
in the result of a complex hand injury each single functional restoration is very important .    2.5399226150451155
therefore , it is necessary that severe hand injuries are treated at well established centres for hand surgery .    2.332494736113844
a 34 - year - old women had a hen ' s UNK - sized supernumerary mammary gland with no nipple or areola in the left anterior axillary line for the last 8 years .    2.167535382529984
the main complaint about the axillary " lump " was that it was aesthetically UNK , and it was excised .    2.434191039821838
the importance of an axillary breast lies in the possibility that pathologic changes could develop in its substance and that clinically it could be confused with a lipoma .    2.160500529160303
early diagnosis and correct excision are usually recommended .    2.5076493778019637
paclitaxel and docetaxel are potent drugs that are effective in the treatment of malignant tumors .    2.762185621262247
the cytotoxic action of these drugs is not fully understood , but it appears to be mediated mainly through mitotic arrest and subsequent apoptosis .    2.4368356836496687
because no information is available on the UNK action of docetaxel , the investigations were performed to determine whether inhibition of neoangiogenesis plays a role in docetaxel ' s antitumor efficacy .    2.5907397874424234
four different mouse tumors , two squamous cell carcinomas ( scc - iv ; scc - vii ) and two adenocarcinomas ( mca - 4 ; mca - 29 ) were assayed for angiogenic activity using the in vivo i . c .    1.9912141040225446
tumor cells ( 5 x 105 ) were injected i . c .    2.3947073705155604
into the skin flap over the abdominal wall , and the number of new blood vessels at the tumor cell injection site was determined 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 days later .    2.8162518218099484
the mice were treated with docetaxel ( UNK - 31 . 3 mg / kg i . v . )    3.118231219437456
1 or 4 days after tumor cell injection .    2.765118994174061
the number of new blood vessels increased with time .    2.5286489392851004
docetaxel reduced the number of newly formed blood vessels in mcas , but not in sccs .    2.9178886069320056
the reduction was associated with UNK tumor growth .    3.0314504941660867
in a separate set of experiments we observed that docetaxel ' s inhibitory effect on the two mcas was histologically associated with massive tumor cell destruction by means of both apoptosis and necrosis .    2.196925541136781
this was not observed for the two sccs .    2.861608971900155
since no reduction in blood vessels occurred in tumors unresponsive to docetaxel , the inhibition of neoangiogenesis in docetaxel - responsive tumors was likely the result of a decrease in angiogenic stimuli due to docetaxel ' s destruction of tumor cells .    2.2521297452753464
a patient on long term parenteral nutrition developed acrodermatitis enteropathica - like skin changes .    2.07911113550164
just as in the autosomal recessive disorder , acrodermatitis enteropathica , the lesions in our patient were caused by zinc deficiency .    2.518985867812582
replacement therapy with zinc led to rapid improvement .    2.40681130277544
a measurement system was developed that permits objective comparisons of the sound conduction of middle ear implants .    2.14244821101442
the implants are fitted into a mechanical middle ear model which approximates the impedances of the UNK and the inner ear .    2.717728021914431
a defined signal within the frequency range of 0 - 5 khz is provided by a miniaturized loudspeaker at the input to the model and is measured by a probe microphone .    2.0891643301800586
displacement of an artificial stapes footplate at the output of the model is measured by a fiberoptic probe with a sensitivity of 5 nm .    2.223132148315665
the transmission function is calculated as the quotient of the output and the input signal .    2.2880890367522904
this system can be used to evaluate the sound - UNK properties of different middle ear implants UNK other influences , such as surgical techniques .    3.112946853533392
this work details the measurement system and demonstrates basic influences on the sound - transmission of middle ear implants .    2.2116711156845015
in acute myocardial infarction intracoronary stenting is superior to ptca regarding interventional success and occurrence of cardiac events .    2.3057420737000713
it is , however , uncertain whether myocardial function also improves with stenting .    2.539184105313984
we , therefore , assessed angiographic parameters of myocardial function in patients with acute myocardial infarction who were treated with primary ptca and received additional stenting in case of an unsatisfactory angiographic result ( provisional stenting ) .    2.876755940938238
in order to perform accurate low - flow anaesthesia ventilation , it is desirable to avoid the influence of fresh gas flow ( fgf ) and inspiration duration ( id ) on the resulting minute volume ( mv ) .    2.4386861666394455
the sulla 808v anaesthesia ventilator ( draeger , UNK , germany ) is originally not equipped with a fresh - gas decoupling ( fgd ) device .    2.241089223416831
therefore , changes of fgf and id settings applied during controlled ventilation may lead to alterations of the resulting mv .    2.386197993789104
recently , a low - cost fgd device ( UNK , bern - UNK , switzerland ) has been developed , which can be inserted into the circle system .    3.1600380509438546
we investigated the effect of this device on mv in the sulla 808v anaesthesia apparatus .    2.4066211479928254
background : in a multicenter study the association of psychosocial stress and the use of psychosocial support in patients with diabetes mellitus was evaluated .    3.0367244007318943
the diagnosis prader - UNK - syndrome ( pws ) in the neonate is difficult because features like neonatal hypotonia and feeding problems are easily misdiagnosed as a consequence of UNK UNK .    2.5587997518955006
craniofacial abnormalities like narrow UNK diameter , UNK shaped palpebral fissures and UNK UNK mouth are underdiagnosed especially if respiratory treatment is necessary .    2.09443246308708
hypogonadism in girls and in milder expression in boys ( for example UNK ) are common and unspecific signs at that age .    2.2730465745475903
typical features like obesity and UNK , small hands and feet and small stature are not expressed until the second year .    2.3966066325720843
the clinical course of pws in the neonate is demonstrated in two cases .    2.635715608560435
diagnostic criteria and therapeutic intervention are discussed .    2.762160667991702
hydrops fetalis as a seldom feature in pws has to be taken into consideration .    2.3576997570770626
diagnosis - related groups ( drgs ) are an instrument for classification of inpatient cases .    2.377775858140126
drgs are finding ever broader implementation internationally .    2.330152380974496
targets for using drgs are hospital financing and budgeting , cost accounting and quality assurance .    2.0922591374063755
the present survey covering 18 countries shows that so far drgs are most frequently used for budgeting purposes .    2.0942611194294267
in addition to drg - based reimbursement , further quality assurance is necessary , but this is only being implemented with UNK .    2.2456174896635073
the coverage planned for all inpatient cases through drg - based reimbursement in germany from UNK on is a pioneering challenge internationally .    1.9512733293395805
the nystagmus patient takes advantage of UNK induced head turns and other forms of compensation .    2.2479903585087104
in the approved test procedures he is deprived of such UNK .    2.1962077486569003
UNK the introduction of the bladder drainage technique , the number of pancreas transplants performed has now reached 1000 / year worldwide .    2.652738076671724
most of these transplants have been performed in the united states .    2.9106042791015594
in contrast , the number of pancreas transplants performed in the UNK community has remained at a low level for several years .    2.7788471765444984
the results of a consecutive series of 20 simultaneous pancreas / kidney grafts ( spk ) performed between june 1994 and october 1995 demonstrate that high graft function rates of 83 . 5 % for pancreas and kidney grafts can be achieved .    2.0475793121576285
therefore spk can be recommended as a standard procedure for patients with insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus and end - stage renal disease in germany , too .    2.9303532793977136
intubation and positive end expiratory pressure ventilation ( peep ) is a well established therapeutic strategy for impaired lung function , particularly following blunt chest trauma .    2.419567078211392
complications of this regime are however also well known and pose the question why non - invasive forms of respiratory assistance such as continuous positive airway pressure ( cpap ) have only gained minor popularity .    2.0379551894815986
the regime consisted of continuous administration of cpap by a face - mask , with gradually increasing periods of spontaneous breathing .    2.0190095896777507
initially a fio2 of 0 . 33 ( range 0 , 28 - 0 , 38 ) proved necessary .    2.5837845773383847
the initial cpap level was 7 mbar ( range 5 - 8 ) with an ( assisted spontaneous breathing ) asb of 15 mbar ( range 13 - 18 ) .    2.1462183956205867
fio2 and cpap / asb levels were subsequently gradually reduced until no longer necessary .    2.003717875137974
in all patients intubation and ventilation was avoided by this regimen .    2.3556728644731684
the treatment was well accepted by all patients and common ventilation associated complications such as pneumonia did not occur .    2.341132711010633
in comparison with the former standard method of treatment the average icu stay was dramatically reduced , principally due to not having to gradually wean patients from ventilation and sedation .    2.046695987522643
other positive benefits include normal communication and feeding with active early mobilisation leading to faster recovery , both physical and psychological .    1.9911331264845606
we conclude that non - invasive respiratory techniques should be used more frequently and recommend further studies are undertaken to define the indications .    2.668884258708607
abstract : clinical findings and the correct assessment of the morphology and degree of stenosis is a UNK point in the conservative and operative therapy of carotid stenosis .    2.855609247841316
diagnosis should be reached fast , sure and cost - effective with a high sensitivity and specifity .    2.8187921619433514
current methods for articular cartilage repair are unpredictable with respect to clinical success .    2.670074147595851
in the present study , we investigated the ability of cells from articular cartilage , perichondrium , and costochondral resting zone to form new cartilage when loaded onto biodegradable scaffolds and implanted into calf muscle pouches of nu / nu mice .    2.0270667142399406
prior in vitro studies showed that platelet derived growth factor - bb ( pdgf - bb ) , but not transforming growth factor beta - 1 ( tgf - 1 ) , basic fibroblast growth factor , or bone morphogenetic protein - 2 promoted proliferation and extracellular matrix UNK of resting zone chondrocytes without causing the cells to exhibit a hypertrophic chondrocyte phenotype .    2.2329410421037976
tgf - 1 has also been shown to stimulate UNK by UNK UNK cells like those in the perichondrium .    3.0536225695441397
in addition , pdgf - bb has been shown to modulate UNK by resting zone cells implanted in poly ( d , l - lactide - co - glycolide ) ( plg ) scaffolds .    1.9436897277006553
in the present study we examined whether the cartilage formation is dependent on state of chondrocyte maturation and whether the pretreatment of chondrocytes with growth factors has an influence on the cartilage formation .    2.2533017678970704
scaffolds were manufactured from 80 % plg with a 75 : 25 lactide : glycolide ratio and 20 % modified plg with a 50 : 50 lactide : glycolide ratio ( plg - h scaffolds ) .    1.8643500691170267
for each experimental group , four nude mice received two identical implants , one in each calf muscle resulting in an n = 8 implants : plg - h scaffolds alone ; plg - h scaffolds with cells derived from either the femoral articular cartilage , costochondral UNK , or costochondral resting zone cartilage of 125 g male UNK - UNK rats ; plg - h scaffolds with either articular chondrocytes or resting zone chondrocytes that were pretreated with 37 , 5 ng / ml UNK - bb for 4 h or 24 h before implantation , or with perichondrial cells treated with pdgf - bb plus 0 , 22 ng / ml UNK - 1 for 4 h and 24 h . at 4 or 8 weeks after implantation , samples were harvested and analyzed UNK for new cartilage formed , area of residual implant and area of fibrous connective tissue .    1.916790273573232
only resting zone cells showed the ability to form new cartilage at a heterotopic site in this study .    2.512113726262575
there was no UNK found in nude mice with implants loaded with either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells .    1.94488398240338
pretreatment of resting zone chondrocytes for 4 h prior to implantation significantly increased the amount of newly formed cartilage after 8 weeks and suppressed chondrocyte hypertrophy .    2.475928447288136
the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing either articular chondrocytes or perichondrial cells decreased with time , whereas the amount of fibrous connective tissue around implants containing resting zone chondrocytes pretreated with pdgf - bb was increased .    2.0821758123146537
the results showed that resting zone cells can be successfully incorporated into biodegradable porous plg scaffolds and can induce new cartilage formation in a non - weight - bearing site .    2.301844516180621
articular chondrocytes as well as perichondrial cells did not have the capacity for UNK when implanted UNK in this model .    2.9617119403391317
bone tumors represent a group of tumors of various dignity .    2.8528859651317195
in spite of this single tumor entities may display strong morphological UNK to each other which can in turn result in profound difficulties in differential diagnosis .    1.9049061919249977
the biological behaviour of a tumor is mainly determined by its rate of proliferation .    2.618753222871027
in this study the rate of proliferation of 64 bone tumors ( 30 high - grade central osteosarcomas , 6 low - grade osteosarcomas , 8 giant cell tumors , 8 aneurysmatic bone cysts , 5 UNK / UNK , 7 fibrous dysplasias and 5 cases of a myositis ossificans ) were analysed .    2.4091901504722535
immunohistochemistry was performed on paraffin - embedded tissue sections using the mib - 1 monoclonal antibody .    2.5181909529308597
mib - 1 recognizes the proliferation - associated ki - 67 protein which is expressed during the active phases of the cell cycle but cannot be detected in senescent cells .    2.261234938885829
among high - grade central osteosarcomas a significantly higher rate of proliferation ( average value 30 % ) was found in comparison with low - grade osteosarcomas and other benign intraosseous bone tumors .    2.9392322637053097
this approach proved to be very useful in the distinction between high - grade and low - grade osteosarcomas as well as bone - forming intraosseous tumors .    3.2289796647484965
however distinguishing low - grade osteosarcomas from benign bone tumors by determining only the rate of proliferation was not possible , although interestingly , the proliferative rate of myositis ossificans , a purely reactive lesion , was in the range of the values determined for high - grade osteosarcoma .    2.3939504320455076
over the past century numerous graft materials have been used for the reconstruction of the cruciate ligament of the knee .    2.7621277329606997
among the autologous tissues that are currently recommended as graft materials , the central bone patellar tendon bone graft , a UNK hamstring graft and the central quadriceps tendon graft have the greatest clinical significance .    2.139708865079728
with some limitations , allograft materials can also be used .    2.6663856573629356
each of the three mentioned grafts has specific features regarding morphological and structural properties , graft fixation and graft incorporation .    2.102616996165255
clinical studies have failed to identify any of the three grafts as superior to the others .    2.782306701539618
when choosing the graft for surgery the different anatomy and function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments have to be considered .    2.627978860457558
myasthenic crisis is a lifethreatening complication of myasthenia gravis due to respiratory failure and inability to swallow and cough up secretions .    2.0988172095006807
frequent causes are intercurrent infections , fluctuations due to the natural history of the disease and insufficient immunosuppressive treatment prior to the crisis .    2.8655343403141584
early referral to an experienced UNK is essential .    2.590998925835702
specific therapy consists of symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors , crisis management with plasmapheresis or immunoglobulins and immunosuppression with UNK .    2.123468998141357
infections must be treated UNK .    2.708752344350879
UNK in patients with previously unrecognized myasthenia gravis is never urgently indicated and should be postponed until the patient is stabilized .    2.865215693859156
in cases of impending respiratory failure and severe swallowing difficulties , early and elective admission to a specialized neurological intensive care unit and elective intubation should be performed .    2.162349079538697
adequate nursing care of intubated patients and a set of prophylactic measures are essential to avoid complications UNK affecting prognosis .    2.286436644117777
whenever it can be achieved , the best therapy of myasthenic crisis is its prevention by appropriate long - term management and follow - up of patients with myasthenia gravis .    3.080324733064366
in a retrospective analysis we evaluated 48 patients who had been arthroscopically treated for tendinitis calcarea .    2.529753029256022
the calcific deposit was removed whenever possible and all patients were treated by arthroscopic subacromial decompression .    2.8153939552970533
in subjects who showed subacromial stenosis by x - ray or by intraoperative findings , an arthroscopic acromioplasty was performed .    2.269584007673471
at follow - up all patients were evaluated according to the constant score .    3.597744646483999
after surgery the constant score significantly improved .    2.7532743697183193
in all cases where acromioplasty was performed , a flattening of the bony configuration was achieved .    2.5930335683041545
the x - ray analysis showed that no calcific deposit with UNK borders converted to sharp borders .    2.34936329999899
patients with disappearance of the calcific deposit postoperatively had significantly better outcome than patients with no change in the x - ray .    2.3760470457188023
an additional acromioplasty did not improve the results .    2.460498884354946
the aim of arthroscopic treatment of calcific tendinitis has to be the removal of the calcific deposit .    3.0739075620397514
acromioplasty does not lead to further improvement of the result .    3.231301047143288
preventive strategies aim to reduce gastric UNK ( UNK ( sucralfate , antacids , pirenzepine ) and to normalize gastric mucosal microcirculation ( sucralfate , pirenzepine ) .    2.2321364160460404
thus , the most important prophylactic measure is an optimized emergency and icu regime aiming to improve oxygenation and microcirculation .    2.3294111844834786
all specific drugs used for stress ulcer prophylaxis have been shown to be effective in prospective controlled studies .    2.4691076969581567
furthermore , pirenzepine has been found to be superior to h2 - antagonists , at least in neurosurgical patients .    2.5136812076197352
insufficient or no data exist to support the use of prostaglandins or omeprazole for stress ulcer prophylaxis .    2.552500687684122
the most important adverse effect of stress ulcer prophylaxis is nosocomial pneumonia due to gastric UNK .    2.1523996369067446
this may occur in long - term ventilated patients with a gastric ph > 4 and may account for up to 50 % of all nosocomial UNK in certain groups of patients .    3.033239601679658
mortality is not influenced by antacids or h2 - antagonists , while sucralfate has been shown to reduce mortality , most probably by inhibition of bacterial translocation .    2.2453836022895626
three years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy , a 66 - year - old man suffered from dyspnea and showed symptoms mainly due to right heart failure .    2.3429477333439035
malignant tumor cells were discovered within extensive pleural effusion .    2.5891985960088997
computed tomography revealed two lesions of the liver suspicious of metastases , and recurrent blood in the UNK was evident .    3.0674218963507456
the patient deteriorated rapidly and died 3 weeks after admission .    2.415634981244465
autopsy findings included an adenocarcinoma of the cecum ( grade ii ) with metastases to the liver .    2.379685866299596
high - grade immunoblastic non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma of UNK differentiation was diagnosed , located within the mediastinal soft tissue and infiltrating the peri - and myocardium .    2.2166087975701814
mesenteric lymph nodes were enlarged with histological verification of malignant lymphoma .    2.4723962015673226
the lymphatic tumor masses had caused considerable compression of the heart and vessels , leading to the signs of cardiac failure .    2.771541379950082
the development of metastasizing colonic carcinoma and high - grade immunoblastic non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma 3 years after heart transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy must be considered an unusual combination .    2.479953472659377
malignant lymphomas following heart transplantation have been described several times .    2.7367185878083964
infection rates are important markers for clinical quality assurance .    2.463002021079649
for internal control , they may only be used under the condition of homogeneous data collection and evaluation according to identical standard operating procedures during the entire investigation period .    2.065773930909417
for inter - hospital comparison , they may only be used if additionally the observed patient groups are well defined and comparable .    2.171396322137827
finally , it is demonstrated that conclusions concerning a general " risk of infection " based on infection rates for specific surgical procedures are not possible and vice versa .    2.4526230438462906
we strongly recommend the future application of a standardized definition of wound infection .    2.5551753411661697
the differentiation between deep and superficial infection should be abandoned .    2.559734123754278
for all mentioned " infection rates " it should be indicated whether it is with reference to the risk of infection of a specific procedure or only a general statement .    2.577541604850926
magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and computed tomography ( ct ) are useful techniques for the objective documentation of the relation between the femoral head and the acetabulum after closed or open reduction of a developmental dislocation of the hip joint .    2.4457000981737407
before the ossification nucleus of the femoral head is sufficiently developed , mri is preferred .    2.507884005547902
for the evaluation of reduction from the 2nd year on , mri and ct are equivalent .    2.5672082027917615
however , in older children mri may also be indicated for the evaluation of cartilaginous structures or the diagnosis of femoral head necrosis .    2.868632698161234
ct in older patients may also be useful for 30 analysis of bony structures , e . g . for planning complex osteotomies .    2.730348149499011
careful diagnostic and early therapy are especially important in cases of scaphoid fractures .    2.7907135935232583
this is due to the patients being mostly young and the high number of non - unions of these carpal bones .    2.9994798112771
conservative and various operative treatments are therapeutical options .    2.422234936157059
fractures of the scaphoid were treated by UNK screw UNK .    3.2569394950083193
when there is a possibility that tissue samples have been UNK , dna analysis of the histological specimens can be carried out to correctly UNK the specimens to a patient .    2.6852130553829787
the use of polymerase chain reaction enables results to be obtained even from degraded dna in formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded samples .    2.001841193488664
a review of 110 children with burkitt ' s lymphoma admitted to the university of nigeria teaching hospital , UNK during a 7 - year period revealed a preponderance of males over females ( 1 . 9 : 1 ) and a peak incidence at five years .    2.582392650304416
the main sites affected initially by the tumour in order of frequency were the face and abdomen .    2.208425709132674
the spinal column , spleen , and lungs were less affected .    2.389013171149411
it is postulated that an interaction between UNK and epstein - barr virus infections and malnutrition are important in the aetiology of the tumour .    2.4386425407908767
the most effective drug is cyclophosphamide .    2.684240067913775
a combination of this drug with UNK and methotrexate is equally effective in inducing remissions , but is better than the single agent in preventing systemic relapse .    2.4273184905862255
follow - up of the patients revealed good survival .    3.461230776021685
the consumption of the jet set drug ecstasy ( 3 , 4 - UNK , abbreviated to mdma ) by young people is increasing markedly .    2.1982213345038613
parallel to this developement , there is a large number of reports on severe neurological , psychiatric and medical complications following the use of ecstasy .    2.86689565731652
seizures are among the most common clinical complications of the cns following the ingestion of ecstasy .    2.693654150151027
the term " mild cognitive impairment " refers to cognitive deficits which exceed normal physiological aging processes , but do not fulfill the criteria for dementia .    2.0226608403189488
the prevalence rates of four current concepts were compared in a sample of UNK healthy 60 - 64 year - old participants recruited from the interdisciplinary longitudinal study on adult development and aging ( ilse ) .    2.135716630355528
furthermore , the relationships between cognitive deficits and psychological and sociodemographic variables were examined .    2.238779908754995
the following prevalence rates were determined : 13 . 5 % for age - associated memory impairment , 6 . 5 % for age - consistent memory impairment , 1 . 5 % for late - life UNK and 23 . 5 % for aging - associated cognitive decline .    2.61525022429187
subjective cognitive complaints did not correlate with results obtained from neuropsychological tests .    2.5418238468788297
significant correlations were however found between subjective cognitive complaints and higher scores on depression and neuroticism scales .    2.0778052849102098
significant correlations were also found between a reduced test performance and a lower educational level and socioeconomic status .    2.336696201890334
longitudinal studies are warranted to further elucidate the predictive value of these diagnostic concepts .    2.451387710863492
in a retrospective study , we evaluated 180 patients treated for painful spondylolisthesis with combined anterior and posterior fusion .    2.579866365504861
group i included 90 patients treated by anterior fusion with the transperitoneal approach .    2.4883266132729727
group ii included 90 patients operated on with a retroperitoneal approach .    2.4248914099698533
group ii showed a higher incidence of pseudarthrosis l5 / s1 ( 4 % ) , tear of the common iliac vein ( 1 % ) , UNK syndrome ( 4 % ) and reversible l4 nerve - root lesion ( 3 % ) .    2.9966622971343555
on the basis of our findings , we recommend the transperitoneal approach for anterior interbody fusion l5 to s1 or l4 to s1 .    2.1741015547840954
coronary surgery is at this point of time the standard therapy of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis .    2.6940651492816627
coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) is performed only in UNK out situations .    2.4981375645488706
the number of publications of successful percutaneous intervention in unprotected left main coronary stenosis is increasing because of increasing use of stents and UNK to avoid stent - thrombosis .    2.147277142169353
the test battery had been applied short time before , during and after the treatment with 10 ect applied unilateral over the UNK hemisphere .    2.423009492749852
comparing the test performances before and 1 - 2 days after the end of the series there were only few remarkable changes : a significant decrease was diagnosed exclusively in 30 min delayed recall of verbal items , while visual short - term memory and visual - constructive performance showed a significant improvement ( in spite of unilateral stimulation on the right side ) .    2.34990129960369
none of the other cognitive functions inclusively speed of performances and reaction time was UNK short time after the end of the ect - treatment , instead all the measures improved albeit not significantly .    2.0830725657505957
between responders to treatment ( 50 % improvement in hamd ) and non - responders no significant differences neither before nor after the treatment were detected .    2.4850593183543372
in this study we assessed the drawing abilities in 37 patients with probable alzheimer ' s disease according to UNK - UNK criteria .    2.8948088302340222
drawing abilities ( drawing : house , UNK , clock ; rey - osterrieth figure ; UNK : mmst - figure ; rey - osterrieth figure ) were quantified with different rating schemes and related to other neuropsychological assessments .    1.9663782456965821
all patients underwent a positron emission tomography with 18 - fdg .    2.5028257998346217
drawing performance was highly correlated with severity of dementia - expressed in mmst scores ( r = 0 . 78 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) - with visuo - spatial short - term memory ( r = - 0 . 69 ; p = 0 . 001 ) , and writing abilities ( r = - 0 . 77 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.3827752302511884
the summarized drawing score showed a statistically significant correlation with the rate of UNK glucose metabolism measured with positron emission tomography and 18 - fdg ( r = 0 . 39 ; p = 0 . UNK ) .    2.5235232449484406
in the UNK of ad patients UNK and simplifications were typical , whereas UNK rarely occured .    2.778656229109742
in severely demented patients closing - in phenomenons could be de - scribed , too .    2.016488084851246
a subgroup of ad patients with visuo - constructive impairment as the leading symptom could not be identified .    2.600528593509978
since the first dermatological outpatient clinic was started in dresden in 1869 , it has seen the practice of dermatology in the UNK sense , with scientific research activity and UNK .    2.394472195698456
the good working relationship between the dermatologists in private practice and those in the clinics has been the main factor in this successful development .    2.3909660545647284
the traditional background of the following sectors is highlighted : outpatient clinic , x - ray and uv UNK treatment , allergology and occupational dermatology , psychosomatic dermatology , dermatosurgery , and phlebology .    2.224983887848059
a 12 - year - old girl from UNK with aids ( cdc : p2 UNK ) presented with a generalized molluscum contagiosum infection .    2.5197082310116268
she had suffered from systemic cryptococcosis and from UNK several months before admission .    2.431417051413246
while molluscum contagiosum infection is usually a self - limiting disease in immunocompetent persons , a fulminant appearance and persistence of giant UNK occurs with advanced immunodeficiency .    2.0363047310327698
histological and immunohistological examinations showed a severe diminution of langerhans and t cell populations that might enhance the dissemination of the infection .    2.027980989715427
molluscum - like lesions of cryptococci have been described , and cutaneous cryptococcosis is the main condition to be considered in the differential diagnosis .    2.7266098580285227
further differential diagnoses should include american and african histoplasmosis , and the cutaneous manifestations of UNK infections , of toxoplasmosis and of pneumocystis carinii infection .    2.4504723828775834
the search for vascular structures in skin tumors by incident light microscopy has revealed a surprisingly high proportion of vascularized tumours .    2.109659250036576
characteristic vascular patterns , in some cases highly tumour - specific , have been defined .    2.88778785240471
the vascular structure is a valuable feature for characterization and differentiation of skin tumours , especially for UNK malignant melanoma .    2.441543552312907
we propose a UNK procedure for analysis and diagnosis of skin tumours using incident light microscopy , which appears to be valuable for advanced image analytic techniques .    2.247813560535916
introduction : the treatment of full - thickness cartilage defects still represents a problem that has not yet been solved satisfactorily .    2.6308431577570905
current methods used to cover defects in the knee joint are osteochondral cylinder transplantation ( oct ) and autologous chondrocyte transplantation ( act ) .    2.3261862133453617
methods : with a prospective clinical investigation , at the time being with 2 - year results , we have examined act in comparison to oct in 20 patients with regard to clinical and histomorphological ( histology , immunohistochemistry , res ) outcome .    2.885063698428464
results : we found equally good results with both methods in lysholm , meyers and tegner activity scores .    2.081547304306367
histomorphologic evaluation of biopsies obtained by arthroscopy after act showed a defect filling in all cases , mainly with fibrous cartilage , while localized areas of UNK regenerative cartilage were documented near the base . we did not see any UNK visible change in the transplants after oct .    1.9448419216074824
conclusion : at the time we prefer oct instead of act given the correct indication .    2.4300645377185917
this case report intends to focus attention on hemodynamic UNK as cause of repetitive involuntary movements ( rims ) as differential diagnosis of simple partial motor seizures .    2.0686777927368443
repeated eeg recordings revealed no epileptic discharges .    2.4138506079345916
in both patients , duplex ultrasonography revealed an occlusion of the internal carotid artery ( ica ) contralateral to the side of the rims .    2.531240817528348
blood flow velocities in the middle cerebral artery ipsilateral to ica occlusion were reduced and vasomotor reactivity to hypercapnia was absent .    2.0139617262463023
after elevation of blood pressure both patients became asymptomatic .    2.681052790638171
we suggest that in patients with episodes of rims , doppler sonography and tests of cerebral vascular reserve capacity should be performed to search for a hemodynamic origin of these symptoms .    2.6106548347941274
ethylene UNK ( edc ) is used as a solvent and in the rubber , plastic , and insecticide industry .    2.4287848767266467
the fatal adult dose is below 20 ml .    2.333594244636335
poisoning can occur from inhalation , ingestion or skin absorption .    2.2646118942175
edc UNK almost all cells , but essentially those of the central nervous system , liver , kidneys , and heart .    2.6872318753115043
death is usually due to liver or central nervous failure .    2.338613233802466
retrospectively analyzing the history of three patients with UNK stromal tumors ( gist ) treated over a period of 1 year in the surgical department of our regional hospital , we tried to answer the following questions : using the current recommendations in the literature , how are the macro - and microscopic features and clinical presentation to be interpreted ?    2.455966188873698
which prognostic and therapeutic conclusions should we draw , giving special consideration to practice - orientated management of such cases .    2.0909107247763723
the patients were 65 , 75 and 88 years old respectively , and in each case the gist manifested as recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding .    2.367960208787407
during surgical treatment four gastric tumors ranging in cross section between 2 . 5 and 8 cm were found .    2.3484507173923497
the gist diagnosis was established after light microscopic and immunohistochemical examinations .    2.271898778340634
going through the current literature , a large number of structural and immunohistochemical criteria have come to light for determining its classification and potential malignancy .    2.179277597730343
on the other hand , very few subsequent recommendations concerning therapy and prognosis can be found and follow - up UNK are almost UNK .    2.4614306590974313
we conclude that UNK are difficult to diagnose because of their UNK and that their clinical behavior is uncertain .    2.5738580580413553
the potential malignancy , on the other hand , requires a well - founded diagnostic procedure in the form of the best possible pre - therapeutic staging .    2.6906508941051865
furthermore , initially radical surgical treatment should be adopted and the follow - up should be adapted to the risk involved .    2.7481513822655748
the latter is arbitrary and further clinical studies are required .    2.401230778778213
in animal experiments and clinical studies liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons improves gas exchange and breathing mechanics in damaged lungs .    2.21715868320501
according to the data on the toxicity of perfluorcarbons available today , it could potentially be applied in infants in the future , too .    2.7122405730868495
however , the catalogue of unanswered questions is still too long for controlled clinical phase iii studies to be conducted .    2.0228241343992166
further possible applications of liquid ventilation offer hope of solving open therapeutic and diagnostic problems .    2.1955024756379107
taking into account all available data about liquid ventilation with perfluorcarbons today , we still do not know whether it is a real alternative method for respiratory support ; however , further studies to investigate whether the method is an alternative strategy for artificial ventilation in neonates are justified .    2.3236443945860783
the role of elective lymph node dissection ( elnd ) in primary malignant melanoma is controversial .    2.4576417787389966
our purpose was to evaluate the benefit of elnd regarding survival and disease - free survival in malignant melanoma of the trunk and extremities .    2.7690984258917997
by matched - pair analysis , 375 patients treated by wide local excision ( wle ) plus elnd were compared to 375 patients treated by wle only .    2.159484205864897
there was no difference in survival between the two treatment groups ; however , the disease - free interval was significantly higher in the collective treated by wle plus elnd ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.5509487016484624
increased survival rates were noted for intermediate tumor thickness of 1 . 51 - 4 . 0 mm for the wle + elnd group although the difference was not significant ( p = 0 . 14 ) , and disease - free survival was significantly improved in this group ( p < 0 . 001 ) .    2.795490153657963
elnd elicited a higher benefit in male patients with intermediate thickness melanoma .    2.3032639220587803
our results confirm the findings of several studies that elnd improves the outcome after primary UNK of malignant melanoma of intermediate tumor thickness .    2.522903487899662
7 patients ( 5 female , 2 male ; age : 22 - 81 years ; average age = 58 , 1 j ) with recurrent necrotizing UNK - negative , non UNK vasculitis , were enrolled into this study .    2.12302300333514
disease was resistant to prior conservative therapy , and therefore patients received high dose intravenous immunoglobulin ( ivig ) - ( dose : 1 , 0 g / kg body weight daily dose 0 , 25 g / kg body weight over 4 consecutive days ) .    2.175860272906762
all patients responded rapidly to this therapeutic regimen .    2.361453889493946
specifically immediate pain relief was striking .    2.9095339464870875
complete clearance of disease was observed in 5 out of 7 patients within 6 months while receiving ivig ( 0 , 5 g / kg body weight ) every 4 weeks for one year .    2.59166017846461
in 2 out of 5 patients ulceration and vasculitis healed completly and therapy could be stopped after 6 months .    2.2004342400797574
in one patient treatment had to be discontinued due to decreasing kidney function .    2.552117403256195
the data presented demonstrate that ivig is an effective and valuable therapeutic modality in treatment of severe vasculitis resistant to conventional therapy .    2.4477865737413955
after orthopedic surgery , skeletal muscle will enter the rehabilitation process in UNK condition due to the following characteristics .    2.588171411870963
after use of a tourniquet during surgery , the muscle suffers ischemia / reperfusion damage due to oxidative stress , resulting in structural impairment .    2.5314474936619846
the resulting immobilization leads to muscular atrophy , with a loss of calcium homeostasis and oxidative stress being of etiological significance .    2.2152642972600525
after UNK , the muscle has impaired functional capacity and frequently shows disturbances in its innervation pattern .    2.3810414970434866
high mechanical loading should therefore be avoided , and electrical stimulation may be applied to facilitate recovery .    2.540834812797178
considering the role of oxygen radicals , supplementation with vitamin e appears generally recommendable .    2.401012148182544
the timing of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy - especially if combined with chemotherapy - has been a subject of interest over the past years .    2.6904569354829473
data concerning the interval between surgery and radiotherapy were correlated with the locoregional control , incidence of distant metastases and prognosis of breast cancer , lung carcinoma , and head and neck carcinomas .    2.8085120706715667
the reviewed data did not show a clear relationship of the time interval between surgery and start of radiotherapy and locoregional control .    2.4942971596734744
however , evaluation of the data was difficult , because in most publications , retrospective analyses were performed and other prognostically more relevant parameters may influence locoregional control stronger than the time interval .    2.282992722452257
in patients with head and neck carcinomas , there is a negative effect of time interval between surgery and radiotherapy on local control if unfavorable factors exist , i . e . , close surgical margins , unfavorable pathohistological parameters and low radiation dose .    2.2427889757187036
in patients with breast cancer who do not receive chemotherapy , there are inconsistent reports in the literature .    2.609035373199703
if additional chemotherapy is necessary , the sequence surgery , chemotherapy and radiotherapy seems adequate .    2.490169932875777
although some data suggest that delaying the initiation of radiotherapy due to chemotherapy may increase the risk or local recurrences , there may , on the other hand , be an increased likelihood of systemic metastases , if radiotherapy is applied before chemotherapy .    2.150891106004586
concerning lung cancer , only one retrospective analysis exists suggesting a better survival of patients with an interval of more than 36 days between surgery and radiotherapy as compared to patients with a shorter interval .    3.1934571563766116
the treatment of severely injured patients is a challenge for preclinical and clinical treatment concepts , causing financial aspects of increasing importance for the german health care system .    2.635604995299894
a total of 32 , 500 polytraumatized patients ( pts iii and iv ) are managed in trauma center levels i - iv in germany .    2.3227308915864415
trauma center levels i or ii are by definition capable of supporting the full range of treatment for the severely injured .    2.237257031513188
with the baseline calculation of 64 , 000 dm per patient and 104 polytrauma treated per year in the berlin virchow clinic , 6 . 66 million dm primary costs must be spent for treatment .    1.9909222580553758
the total annual costs of this center are nearly 24 million dm for emergency cases and 7 million dm fixed costs per year , for a trauma center level i .    2.0238132533590822
in europe the distribution of trauma center levels i or ii is sufficient and can be specified with 1 center per 1 million inhabitants .    2.306929565395556
nevertheless , the european air medical service could support more intensive use of these central trauma institutions .    2.125146756804272
this was shown by comparing the number of polytrauma patients and the number of trauma centers .    3.4400996033376035
less then half of these patients are treated in levels i or ii trauma centers .    2.890765022476283
the financial pressure on the health system and the rising quality must lead to better utilization of trauma centers .    2.2554336019806023
to meet this goal a annual treatment rate of 300 - 400 polytrauma patients should be aimed at .    2.1910223533367854
the claim of the american college of surgeons that a trauma surgeon should treat 50 severely injured patients per year would then be possible .    2.122187082215181
this report is a retrospective investigation of the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies given to adults in a private practice setting and furthermore a study of the stability of the therapeutic results achieved .    2.545602881043364
in the spring of 1997 a total of 16 bioenergetic therapists ( 6 of them medical doctors and 10 psychologists ) , all members of the swiss society of bioenergetic therapists ( UNK ) , provided upon request a number of data on 319 patients who had terminated their therapies after a minimum of 20 sessions 6 months to 6 years earlier .    2.305483560692177
a self - evaluating questionnaire was then constructed , to be answered anonymously , and was sent to these 319 patients in late summer 1997 ; UNK of them could be reached and 142 ( 49 % ) returned it .    2.2313708733636877
the questionnaire contained questions related to the psychic and physical condition , to interpersonal and psychosomatic problems , and to the effect of body work on physical consciousness , cognitive insights and changes of the quality of life .    2.7096186339795096
regarding the efficacy of bioenergetic therapies , the statistical analysis of the returned questionnaires showed significant positive changes in all areas questioned .    2.488830801045098
bioenergetic body work was judged to be important and indispensable by about half of the patients .    2.6376517424837966
regarding the stability of the therapeutic result , 107 patients indicated a stable or even improved condition .    2.3768924013420087
of the 35 patients who since termination of the bioenergetic therapy had chosen to undergo further therapy , 16 opted again for a body - oriented psychotherapy .    2.0242141224112222
purpose : in a clinical study 35 patients with intracranial aneurysms were examined using ct - angiography , mr - angiography ( mra ) and digital subtraction angiography ( dsa ) .    2.2928745422982453
the aim of the study was to establish the ability of noninvasive techniques to detect intracranial aneurysms .    2.342194333983414
" classic " choroidal neovascularization ( cnv ) has a relatively uniform appearance in UNK angiography .    2.2085761566799764
in contrast , indocyanine green ( icg ) angiography shows variable features of well - defined cnv .    2.074964190001743
we examined 31 classic cnv patients secondary to age - related macular degeneration using a confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope ( heidelberg retina UNK ) in order to determine icg characteristics of classic cnv .    2.206929534829803
vascular patterns ( 97 % ) , a UNK rim ( 84 % ) , a UNK margin ( 42 % ) , late icg leakage ( 32 % ) and " feeder vessels " were identified in variable frequency .    3.102957377305841
some of the icg characteristics may correlate with histological features of the membrane and reflect proliferative activity .    2.4617638136000286
UNK " feeder vessels " may be amenable to laser UNK in the presence of UNK cnv .    2.7761390848980816
in situ polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) and pcr in situ hybridization are new diagnostic tools in UNK .    2.121957138416501
with optical control of the pcr reaction product in these techniques , false - positive results due to contamination can be minimized .    2.4975873516873324
several working protocols have been established which allow detection of dna and rna sequences in a rapid and reproducible manner .    2.293205692605483
two different methods have been established to detect the amplification product , the indirect pcr in situ hybridization ( pcrishyb ) , and the direct in situ pcr ( is pcr ) .    2.467656929864013
an easy and reproducible method for pcrishyb and ispcr in formalin - fixed and paraffin - embedded tissue is described and the two techniques are compared .    2.0989754368958375
using both ispcr and pcrishyb , the amplification product can be visualized with an optimal morphological preservation of the tissue .    2.174400523583238
indirect pcrishyb showed a slightly higher specificity whereas direct ispcr was the quicker , easier and less expensive method .    1.8738955591867863
in a randomized study 30 patients with chronic stationary psoriasis were treated with 3 different topical schemes .    2.9219186222005114
group 1 ( n = 10 ) received monotherapy ( dithranol ( d ) twice a day , d / d ) , group 2 ( n = 10 ) calcipotriol mornings / dithranol evenings ( calcipotriol ( c ) / dithranol ( d ) c / d ) and 3 ( mometasone ( m ) mornings / dithranol ( d ) evenings , m / d ) .    2.2913709000073466
during the therapy period of 4 weeks we documented the pasi - score as well as infiltration , erythema and desquamation weekly .    2.529446864165358
the m / d group revealed in the first week a significantly faster reduction of the pasi - score ( 5 , 3 ) than in the d / d group ( pasi 13 , 22 ) .    2.579387301582014
the c / d group ( pasi 10 , 5 ) show a not significantly faster reduction .    2.319825932913786
after 4 weeks of treatment and after a follow period of 6 weeks there were similar pasi - scores in all groups .    2.6298978881403237
there were less side - effects in the m / d group than in the others .    2.8980331602791485
the beginning , more anti - psoriatic effectiveness was achieved by the mometasone / dithranol combination than the other schemes .    2.247176577082209
in the long term , the effects were similar .    2.991638675807695
this report describes a distinctive pattern of findings in peripheral sensory - nociceptive afferent nerves after spinal injury .    2.0076753443010906
subsequent to trauma there was segmental , UNK or UNK hypoaesthesia with refractory , UNK painful symptoms .    2.5447595666612
none of the classical neurological causes for such hypoaesthesia were present .    2.338912755566903
" normal " therapy resulted in more severe symptoms .    2.6454826329754506
depending on the distribution of the hypo - or anaesthesia , there were also efferent symptoms ( coordination problems , impairments of proprioception , etc . ) .    2.2086116966474147
colleagues who have made similar observations or are familiar with these symptoms are UNK invited to assist with the interpretation of this clinical picture .    2.2611219625948293
the pharynx , being part of the UNK as well as the respiratory system , is embedded in the complex spatial anatomy of the neck and , due to its function and location , represents a very sophisticated region .    3.293206515917498
cisatracurium ( UNK , UNK , UNK - UNK ) , an intermediate - acting non - depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent , is a UNK of atracurium .    3.6953798028229925
histamine releasing UNK and serum tryptase level have been investigated after administration of cisatracurium ( 3xed95 , 5xed95 ) or vecuronium ( 3xed90 ) in surgical patients .    2.0632537139047624
methods : after approval by our institutional review board , 62 patients ( asa i - ii ) were randomly assigned to three groups to receive either 3xed95 or 5xed95 cisatracurium , or 3xed90 vecuronium as a rapid bolus .    1.8236408567896925
a prick test was done the day before by UNK of the skin in the forearm .    3.084414177647051
after premedication with 2 mg lormetazepam , anaesthesia was induced with thiopentone ( 4 - 12 mg / kg ) and maintained with o2 / n2o and isoflurane ( 1 . 5 - 2 vol . % ) .    2.227763441798077
six minutes after thiopentone , the patients received the relaxant , and after further 6 min 0 . 1 - 0 . 2 mg fentanyl was given and the trachea was intubated .    2.6372211764436084
heart rate ( hr ) and blood pressure ( bp ) were monitored every minute .    2.1704489938784817
blood samples for histamine were withdrawn 5 min prior 3 and 5 min after each drug administration ( thiopentone , relaxants ) .    2.0394097433547023
additionally , serum tryptase was measured by ria at baseline ( - 10 and - 1 min ) and 15 and 60 min after the relaxant administration .    2.3681747695243174
levels for histamine > 1000 pg / ml and for tryptase > 2 µg / ml were considered significant .    2.3391287462671757
cutaneous signs of histamine release were documented .    2.5639483063749817
results : ten patients showed a positive prick - test reaction .    2.6994981006866356
only after thiopentone some cutaneous signs ( 4 UNK , 1 erythema ) of histamine release were observed .    2.211912532190165
there were no cutaneous signs of histamine release correlating with cardiovascular changes .    2.1159504883050397
analysis of the blood samples demonstrated no significant increase in the histamine level in all three groups .    3.2334768503251796
only in 1 patient was a significant higher histamine level ( UNK pg / ml ) measured 5 min after 5xed95 cisatracurium .    2.728128272870125
all measurements of serum tryptase were within the physiological limits .    2.447694922982745
discussion : in this study , with the particular time course of drug administration , neither cisatracurium nor vecuronium increased plasma histamine levels .    2.5482592331075153
only after 5xed95 cisatracurium was 1 elevated histamine level documented after 5 min .    2.171843539243379
in several studies increased histamine levels have been described , but without clinical manifestations .    2.7074618772676446
it is known that cutaneous signs can occur without increased plasma histamine levels due to the structural heterogeneity of mast cells .    2.3606153179849367
the cutaneous reactions in this study were caused by thiopentone .    3.2004215885699487
the tryptase values were within normal limits even in the patient with histamine release .    2.8746077120551146
whether cisatracurium has a potential for immunologic release is unknown .    2.356475009674035
we report on a psychosis caused by application of a transdermal scopolamine patch for over 15 days .    2.197301846473969
in the literature there is no mention of a case in which scopolamine had such an influence nor are any cases reported in which paranoid - UNK symptoms UNK 11 days after removing the patch .    2.295515847268257
bone and joint tuberculosis , as all other types of tuberculosis is generally treated with UNK combination chemotherapy .    2.279336194019249
this has to be continued for a minimum of six months , or nine months in case of extensive spreading .    2.8648838823940292
a two - to three - month initial phase with four or five different drugs ( h , r , z , and additionally e and / or s ) is followed by a four - to six - month therapy with h and r alone , provided the pathogen is fully susceptible to a standard regimen .    2.0665186083590914
the main side effects are hepatotoxic or allergic reactions .    2.536932174903846
a frequent contra - indication is existing , often toxicity - induced , liver damage .    2.0613566500633342
the main local complications requiring surgery are spinal instability or neurologic deficiencies .    2.175218538222358
this report concerns the case of a patient who had suffered a massive pulmonary embolus and for whom , despite immediately administered thrombolytic therapy with rt - pa it became necessary to initiate reanimation procedures .    2.277110750106415
the patient was subsequently admitted to our cardiac surgery clinic for the purpose of operative intervention .    2.646767855831501
after UNK coupling on the heart - lung machine , right ventricular relieve was rapidly attained .    2.162879518990199
during the course of a 3 - hour period of extracorporal circulation , the initially significantly elevated pulmonary pressures were able to be reduced to moderate levels .    2.7481283766953903
correspondingly , right ventricular recovery could be echocardiographically determined .    2.3369640330316535
as a consequence of this development , and after UNK the presence of any large thrombotic masses which might have been situated in the pulmonary trunk , it was possible to forego thoracotomy and embolectomy .    2.6312808398329346
this procedure allowed , on the one hand , the avoidance of imminent right ventricular failure through the use of the heart - lung machine .    2.830543255277193
on the other , due to the UNK of the degree of surgical intervention , the risk of grave hemorrhaging as a result of concurrent thrombolytic therapy could be UNK .    3.4364917851523824
after an uneventful course , the patient was able to be transferred on the second postoperative day with normal pulmonary pressure values .    2.850975502429843
objectives correction of bone deformities at UNK - epiphyseal level of long bones through a corticotomy and gradual distraction .    2.0977989279706057
restoration of shape and function of lower limb .    2.817864985817103
morbidity and mortality are infrequent in countries where induced abortion is legal and medically well organized , but widespread in many developing countries where it is either UNK or UNK .    2.0572855596158903
we observed two patients with stone formation in the renal pelvis two and five years after pyeloplasty .    2.5658947234335234
in both cases there was no obstruction of the pyeloureteral junction detectable .    2.8584008337160682
we consider the use of UNK ( UNK ) for the pelvis suture as reason for the stone formation .    3.5000916555805928
for stone removal we favourite an endoscopic procedure , in which a removal of UNK of the suture is even possible as the verification of the pyeloureteral junction .    2.819831823154322
aim of the study : the aim was to determine the efficiency of a secure control of ventilation in emergency medicine by using capnometry .    2.840957785522874
this question was of special interest for mechanically ventilated patients with cerebral diseases , because here hyperventilation as well as hypoventilation can result in severe consequences .    2.6302981415025792
however , photoastigmatic refractive keratectomy ( park ) remains a matter of controversy .    2.0471564464909426
the purpose of our study was to determine the UNK of UNK 20 / 20 excimer laser photorefractive keratectomy in the treatment of myopic astigmatism .    2.848961465652115
in germany , insect allergies cause about 10 - 40 death per year .    2.249686461194675
starting a specific immunotherapy ( sit ) and its maintenance may be UNK for the allergic patients .    2.651076917800523
performing a prospective study , we exactly documented effects and side effects during the induction phase of sit using a purified aqueous yellow jacket venom preparation in 20 patients allergic to yellow jacket venom ( clinical degree ii - iv ) .    2.1581469778816897
indication for the therapy was defined individually for each patient and was based on a score incorporating the following criteria : a ) clinical symptoms , b ) in - vivo - and in - vitro testing , c ) risk of re - UNK .    2.6428809546065595
sit was started under inpatient conditions following a standardized 8 day protocol .    2.1476802691887222
40 % of all patients showed subjective side effects ( median value of threshold dose 30 µg , range 0 . 2 - 60 µg ) and 30 % showed objective side effects ( median value of threshold dose 55 µg , range 20 - 80 µg ) ; however , all side effects were clinically mild .    2.4080998660656388
when objective systemic side effects were seen , the cumulative daily dose was 39 - 210 µg ( median value 135 µg ) , exceeding 100 µg in 83 % of patients .    2.1915056064970475
our prospective study confirmed that the chosen protocol for sit is effective in inducing tolerance to the venom preparation .    2.1423383396523894
however , using a purified aqueous yellow jacket preparation did not result in reduction of side effects .    2.250839183119537
a 76 year old patient with actinic reticuloid was treated with cyclosporin a .    2.866133911416123
11 months after beginning the immunosuppressive therapy , he developed lymphoedema and livid nodular skin lesions of the right leg , which histologically showed kaposi ' s sarcoma .    2.473530089732857
after stopping the cyclosporin a and intralesional therapy with interferon alpha , no regression of the kaposi sarcoma could be seen .    2.1925069368125425
the characteristics of kaposi sarcoma arising during immunosuppressive therapy and the differences in incidence , risk groups and distribution pattern compared to the classic sporadic and the aids - related kaposi sarcoma will be described .    2.367404795884159
the development of kaposi sarcoma during immunosuppressive therapy for actinic reticuloid has not been previously described .    2.573355095156707
this analysis was undertaken to review the outcome and toxicity of postoperative adjuvant therapy for stage ii and iii rectal cancer .    2.402104362248556
median radiation dose was 56 gy ( range : 45 to 66 gy ) .    2.287157245454203
chemotherapy consisted of 4 to 6 courses of 5 - fluorouracil ( 5 - fu ) ( 420 mg / m2 / d ) and leucovorin ( 200 mg / m2 / d ) .    2.509446602821154
median follow - up was 37 months .    3.336561805991599
the overall survival was 84 % for patients with uicc stage ii and 45 % for patients with uicc stage iii disease ( p = 0 . 0045 ) .    2.8610554756990734
there were no statistically significant differences between patients treated with radiochemotherapy vs radiotherapy in terms of 5 - year survival ( 63 % after radiochemotherapy vs 53 % after radiotherapy , p = 0 . 16 ) , relapse - free survival ( 52 % vs 50 % ) and locoregional control ( 69 % vs 67 % ) .    2.6334183130777156
uicc stage iii disease was associated with high failure rates ( 40 % pelvic recurrences and 53 % distant metastases ) .    2.4363890257163603
there was a statistically significant difference in terms of the incidence of distant metastases between the 2 treatment modalities for patients with stage iii disease ( 49 % 5 - year probability for developing distant metastases after radiochemotherapy vs 66 % after radiotherapy , p = 0 . 047 ) .    2.629602733113624
in a multivariate analysis , the addition of chemotherapy , lymph node stage and grading were independent prognostic factors for survival .    2.4185884436762235
severe late toxicity was documented in 5 % of treated patients .    2.9422190577114593
prognosis of patients with uicc stage iii rectal cancer remains poor after " standard " surgery followed by postoperative adjuvant treatment ( pelvic radiotherapy and bolus intravenous injection of 5 - fu and leucovorin ) .    2.266682042744043
more effective multimodality treatment strategies should be investigated in prospective randomized trials .    2.551047733029542
UNK warhol underwent UNK in 1957 because of a nasal skin lesion , which is best diagnosed as a rhinophyma on the basis of the available biographical literature .    2.794122934217974
throughout his creative life , the UNK worked on different aspects of plastic surgery especially in the nasal area .    2.780470109026226
as one of the founders of UNK - art , warhol left essential marks on the modern society and influenced our standards of aesthetic shapes .    2.261986675913169
objective : the clinical activity of rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) is not reliably reflected by laboratory measures .    2.3239671429558735
proteolytic enzymes involved in the cascade of joint destruction are potentially useful parameters to monitor the extent of joint inflammation in ra .    2.5471015454588293
this study compares the validity of two classes of proteolytic enzymes , matrix metalloproteinases ( mmp ) and lysosomal cysteine UNK ( cathepsin b , h , and l ) as well as their respective inhibitors to serve as parameters of ra disease activity .    2.024547540951937
a 47 year old male patient with miller - fisher - syndrome did not respond to treatment with plasmapheresis and intravenous high dose 7 s immune globulins .    2.216488716113958
only cerebrospinal fluid UNK , administered as final alternative , lead to definite improvement and cure .    2.1733458539306385
invasive selective coronary angiography as a clinical method is about 40 years old .    2.4100229891642035
this article UNK this period , written by an r & d UNK , deals with four parts : first the situation before 1965 is UNK upon .    1.9044635714518214
for the time after 1965 the second and third parts describe the development of the procedure and of the technique with special reference to the work of prof . dr . k . bachmann and to the facility , which in 1967 was designed together with him and further developed .    2.5885734689841815
k . bachmann had already taken up the method of invasive coronary angiography around 1965 , which makes him one of the group of pioneering users who developed the fundamentals of the procedure and led coronary angiography to its self - evident use today .    2.2785657721159014
the first clinical application of high resolution image UNK with the input UNK produced from UNK UNK UNK in UNK appears as one of the highlights of the continuous improvements of the facility .    2.9325516881831573
the fourth part of the article UNK the status of today and , considering the new methods using mri , ebct as well as ct , it predicts that the invasive coronary angiography will remain an indispensable method at least for the medium - term future .    2.384926242189
proton pump inhibitors ( omeprazole , UNK , and UNK ) have UNK the therapy of peptic disease of the upper gastrointestinal tract and reduced the indications for surgical intervention .    3.3371187825707715
these substances inhibit the h + / k + - UNK in the parietal cells with an acid suppressing potency that is much higher than that of h2 - receptor - antagonists .    2.286508681725565
the first proton pump inhibitor , omeprazole , has been introduced ten years ago .    2.4859639614655515
since then , sufficient experience with this drug in children has accumulated .    2.5560350156815614
omeprazole is released for children aged one year or older .    2.308094583679794
a new formulation makes the drug applicable in tube fed patients .    2.1605802813100894
the main indications for the use of omeprazole are endoscopically verified peptic esophagitis and gastric and duodenal ulcerations of different etiologies .    2.385970659177206
in the treatment of helicobacter pylori - infection a sufficient acid suppression is essential for the efficacy of the antibiotics .    2.6292348824312244
the recommended pediatric dose ranges between 0 , 7 - 1 , 4 mg / kg bodyweight and day .    2.7611080723574135
however , some children with ulcerative esophagitis may need daily doses up to 3 . 5 mg / kg .    2.597450833435739
healing of the esophageal mucosa should be monitored by endoscopy .    2.6540568674039293
after remission , doses can often be reduced for maintenance therapy .    2.2161201383867586
side effects are rare and do not seem to increase with higher doses .    3.08223104782771
possibly interactions with other medications , i . e .    2.3661415386814073
antiepileptic drugs , may occur .    2.726889993086824
a long - term therapy lasting more than 6 months in a child should be monitored by an experienced pediatric UNK .    2.617816688419391
nosocomial urinary tract infections ( uti ) are frequent complications after transurethral prostatectomy .    2.4334811988073066
the resection itself , postoperative catheterization and the prostate are possible causes of these infections .    2.3329808659899816
in this prospective study we investigated the influence of bacterial prostatic colonization on the incidence of postoperative urinary tract infections and inflammatory complications .    2.838961972607414
in 78 patients we observed in 42 cases ( 53 , 8 % ) a bacterial prostatitis .    2.683686881819094
in 14 patients ( 17 , 9 % ) we found nosocomial uti ' s and in 12 patients ( 15 , 4 % ) inflammatory complications .    3.3668475523951233
the incidence of postoperative uti ' s increase significantly in patients with positive prostate - cultures .    2.8639366899790155
on the other hand we only found corresponding prostate - and postoperative urine - cultures in less than 50 % .    2.310043318705055
the presented data are not sufficient to conclude the kind of relevance of bacterial prostatic colonization for postoperative uti ' s in transurethral prostatectomy .    2.27600862774047
under consideration of the significant increase of nosocomial uti ' s in patients with positive prostate cultures a perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis seems to be required in general .    2.9237336406420966
apnea , bradycardia and oxygen desaturation in infants with very low birth weight are common findings in neonatal intensive care .    2.181157085630403
the prognostic significance of their intensity and frequency and the principles of treatment , however , are controversial .    2.7293733428176563
the universal aim , in order to prevent traumatization of the lung , is to ventilate infants with very low birth weight for as short a time as possible .    2.368016809561093
therefore drugs such as theophylline , aminophylline and doxapram and techniques such as nasal cpap have been studied in our neonatal intensive care unit .    2.1005965321181224
in these studies we developed a treatment algorithm .    2.8030192716211793
in two clinically controlled studies performed UNK we first proved that sodium acetate theophylline given intravenously has the same efficacy as aminophylline .    1.9134024538960908
as aminophylline has more side effects , sodium acetate theophylline is preferable .    2.4402468230911296
bradycardia , apnea and desaturation were registered from the print - out of the monitoring system ' s trend analysis and in a UNK study during steady - state conditions .    2.4097711556094743
in a historical study we were able to prove that intravenous injection of aminophylline is superior to oral administration .    2.5329868922294145
we demonstrated equal efficacy of doxapram and theophylline ; however , doxapram reduced the rate of apnea significantly more during the first 3 days of treatment .    2.559398788816978
in a retrospective study we analyzed the efficacy of nasal cpap as the third level of treatment .    2.7192712602618294
the rate of bradycardia , apnea and desaturation was significantly reduced during cpap and respiratory rate and oxygenation improved .    2.2017693245479917
the algorithm developed established theophylline with 5 mg / kg as bolus infusion over 20 min , followed by 3 mg / kg UNK as the first line of treatment .    2.443769442323272
only if a quick therapeutic response was desirable was doxapram the first drug of choice ( indication > = 4 bradycardias below 80 / min , 4 desaturations below 80 % or 2 apneas of > = 20 s over 2 h ) .    1.992398741424127
after 48 h an additional second drug was added if we could still observe > = 3 apneas , 15 bradycardias or 15 desaturations over this period .    1.8152027679528364
nasal cpap was introduced as the third line of treatment .    2.513154909805556
with this treatment algorithm we were able to reduce the time on a respirator of infants with very low birth weight from 4 . 9 to 3 . 4 days ( p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.5029985206432617
an evaluation of similar treatment algorithms in multi - institutional studies is indicated .    2.304479736689603
background : associations between back pain , the quality of sleep and the quality of UNK have not yet been investigated systematically .    2.981629486473928
methods : at check - out we asked UNK consecutive guests of a trade fair hotel about the subjective quality of sleep in the previous night .    1.9240079146370126
nine rooms had been equipped with new mattresses of three different qualities and prices , but this was kept blind to the hotel staff and the guests .    2.0277195877754397
sleep quality was assessed on an analog scale between 1 ( very good ) and 5 ( very bad ) and was analyzed in comparison to the remaining 8 - year old mattresses of the hotel , but also with respect to social ( e . g .    2.506846436450845
private vs . professional reason for the stay ) as well as personal ( e . g .    2.6529090542440206
previous experience with low back and sleep complaints ) characteristics of the guests .    2.515386011671473
results : the three qualities of the mattresses correlated significantly and positively with the perceived quality of sleep , but the difference to the " old " mattresses was most pronounced for those guests who were staying UNK for professional reasons , or who frequently were suffering from low back pain or sleep disturbances .    1.9788340154857278
conclusion : at least for chronic sufferers from back pain and sleep problems , the association between sleep quality and quality of the UNK is significant .    3.0430818711059726
body oriented psychotherapy is used nowadays in in - patient and out - patient settings , individually or in groups , alone or combined with other methods .    2.2219771067773455
these methods have special importance in patients whose body feeling is reduced , who are restricted in their emotions , or for those who are difficult to reach because of resistances of character .    2.276235805917594
short examples are given as an introduction to the methods used often the most nowadays , reference is made to other procedures .    2.241422598701555
the connection of emotions to the vegetative and autonomic nervous system inter UNK and the link between emotional and physical processes which is especially strong to the beginning of life and which combines with the specifically experienced form of interaction and has UNK consequences are mentioned as active factors .    2.167391391315252
in later development , the body and certain parts of the body acquire a UNK meaning too , which is important for the therapy .    3.0023442067856854
the relationship of body oriented procedures to verbal psychotherapy and especially to psychoanalysis shall also be discussed .    2.106776181607395
approaches to empirical research are pointed out .    2.4932243353823136
paraneoplastic neurological syndromes are rare diseases that occur in relation to cancer .    2.675609052515698
supporting the hypothesis of an autoimmune mechanism , specific UNK antibodies have sometimes been detected .    2.341697377947155
the current possibilities for treatment are limited .    2.743625300256862
a female patient , aged 57 , suffering from a breast cancer , developed a severe paraneoplastic cerebellar syndrome and limbic encephalitis within a few weeks .    2.419272939986023
it is possible that the impressive partial remission that occurred during the ensuing 6 months was not due to therapy .    2.209755118980227
although the patient was still bound to a UNK , discharge from hospital was possible because she was still able to perform daily tasks by UNK .    2.620439764849812
a recurrence of the cerebellar symptoms with mild alterations of mental status occurred 2 months later but again showed a good remission .    2.144089916702827
the outcome in 163 patients treated for an abdominal aortic aneurysm in the department for vascular and thoracic surgery since its institution 5 years ago is investigated .    2.2941591599336735
some 142 patients underwent operative aneurysm repair ; 21 ( 13 % ) were excluded from operation .    2.3345010105713757
in 108 ( 66 % ) an elective procedure was performed , an emergency operation for rupture 34 times ( 21 % ) .    2.2456309547104785
in 16 % of cases one or both renal arteries or the inferior mesenteric or the internal iliac artery were reimplanted .    2.4362383459565797
for further analysis the patients were split in three groups : elective group 1 , symptomatic group 2 , ruptured group 3 .    2.6207088866602586
significant differences were found in the aneurysmal diameter , distribution of gender ( 128 m , 14 f ) , renal artery involvement , or concomitant peripheral arteriosclerosis as well as for the risk factors tobacco smoking , hyperlipidemia , renal insufficiency , and the presence of multiple risk factors .    2.5721173461033713
group 1 had a significantly higher preoperative hospital stay than group 2 ; whereas the intensive care stay was significantly longer in group 3 than in the other two groups .    2.4313074334866727
sixty - four percent of patients had no , 11 % had more than one complication .    2.6001293677331248
the most frequent complication in groups 1 and 2 was pneumonia ( 13 . 9 % ) followed by cardiac complications ( 4 . 6 % ) , and renal insufficiency ( 3 . 7 % ) .    3.243866655107711
in group 3 respiratory insufficiency demonstrated the highest incidence ( 23 . 5 % ) , followed by renal insufficiency ( 21 % ) and pneumonia ( 17 . 6 % ) .    2.862485942279619
no patient of the UNK group suffered an aneurysm rupture ; aneurysm diameters , except one , did not increase during the follow - up period .    2.538316346031072
of the 130 operated and discharged patients 31 died ; in no case was death related to the operative procedure .    2.3820351689858086
no important complications were observed during the follow - up of 37 . 2 + / - 17 . 9 months .    3.257854761083601
furthermore , the results are compared with those of the literature .    3.4026216120009365
nevertheless , the results compared well with those in the literature and were satisfactory .    3.188403038493074
we report on a 32 - year - old male patient with advanced acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) , who had severe candidiasis of the gastrointestinal tract .    2.1892818801641063
treatment with fluconazole , 200 mg / day , was introduced .    2.6574055587050056
after oral intake of fluconazole over 5 months itraconazole 200 mg / day was given for 1 month .    2.2932731548988703
however , fungal infection still persisted .    2.4343999431677323
the antifungal activity of fluconazole , itraconazole and ketoconazole against candida albicans was evaluated by means of the UNK test by determining the 90 % inhibitory concentrations of each drugs .    2.558726503461732
a high minimal inhibitory concentration ( mic ) was detected for fluconazole ( 50 µg / ml ) revealing fluconazole resistance .    2.1031035990423326
the susceptibility to itraconazole was borderline ( mic 0 . 125 µg / ml ) and that to ketoconazole was markedly lowered ( mic 0 . 25 µg / ml ) .    2.0925373534682907
plasma levels of itraconazole were also found to be lowered .    3.254185372856177
in hiv patients the gastrointestinal absorption of azole derivatives is often reduced .    2.2207101440729264
therefore , the clinical resistance of candida albicans to itraconazole can be explained by reduced susceptibility after azole therapy and also by the decreased absorption of the drug in hiv patients .    2.347698142656851
patients suffering from soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities may sometimes require vascular reconstruction to remove the tumor with adequate margins of clearance .    2.413907051529599
besides this , recurrent lymph node metastases are often UNK to neighboring vessels .    2.56472854140774
mri and angiography represent the adequate diagnostic procedures .    2.494583660668766
vessel - invasive sarcoma can hardly be treated by surgical resection with curative intent alone .    2.434597997679498
if there is doubt about invasion of arteries and veins , the vessels should be resected and replaced by autologous vein graft .    2.1234947201172254
soft tissue coverage is of major importance , particularly if prosthetic grafts are used or the resection is within an area of irradiated tissue .    2.048846899113746
after radical resection and combined modality therapy , one can expect local recurrence rates similar to those without vessel invasion .    2.2046526294238222
to achieve this goal , surgical oncologists , vascular surgeons and plastic surgeons must work together .    2.143261854950275
today , amputation can hardly be justified even in vessel - invasive soft tissue tumors .    2.2748218375167975
the study aimed to evaluate whether superimposed high - frequency jet ventilation ( UNK ) is a useful tool in intensive care medicine to ventilate patients with pulmonary insufficiency .    2.9498740146525293
surgery on the lacrimal system in UNK children was performed at the UNK university eye hospital from 1987 to 1992 .    2.687283011615231
the dermatology clinic in krefeld has treated a wide range of patients since its founding in UNK .    2.188005768363884
nowadays the spectrum consists of allergology , occupational dermatology , phototherapy , dermatosurgery , phlebology and UNK as well as special clinics for UNK , sexually transmitted diseases and patients with hiv - infection .    2.352030990352677
background : dapiprazole hydrochloride is an alpha - 1 - adrenergic inhibitor that anticipates the UNK effect of phenylephrine in dilator muscle receptors in a competitive way .    2.030076041037379
the aim of this study was to determine for which indications for UNK pupil dilation by phenylephrine alone is sufficient and if the reversal by dapiprazole is UNK and the practical .    2.1797727155761986
the quality assurance programmes of the social security insurance authorities are presented from the point of view of psychosomatic rehabilitation .    2.4584332262199786
this presentation attempts to introduce aspects of both quality assurance and quality management into the field of medical rehabilitation .    2.327881167546542
the consequences of the programme for political order are emphasized .    2.2317850289457084
the special features of the individual programme objectives are elaborated .    3.002457036837577
in addition , the importance of each of these objectives for psychosomatic rehabilitation is examined .    2.5252750349694253
this field will inevitably have to UNK concepts of time and resource optimization .    2.4572250330413246
for many years the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome has been on the top of medical articles about the intensive care patient .    2.4779347008774897
while severity scores deal with the 1st icu day physiology , the organ dysfunction systems aim to take in account the duration type and severity of physiologic disturbances during the icu stay .    2.0298747153364918
only 2 systems are different : the mods of UNK et al .    2.2014040715517886
and the logistic organ dysfunction lod system of le UNK et al . , both published recently ( 1995 and 1996 ) .    2.184893402095174
they differ from the others because first they were created either from a literature review ( UNK ) or from a logistic regression ( lod ) , and secondly , because neither takes into account the therapy .    2.437381457334216
besides , the lod system , when used on the 1st icu day , has statistical qualities which are very promising .    2.222094246842074
the lod system is now used each consecutive day on septic patients in an european multicenter study .    2.0589702180692386
the UNK between the growth of tumors and the expression of the UNK bcl - 2 could be shown in epithelial tumors .    3.4768297656058986
a bcl - 2 expression leads to a prolonged cell survival due to an inhibition of apoptosis .    2.7360938266591104
the potential meaning of bcl - 2 expression in mesenchymal tumors remains still unknown .    2.1950207104884125
the fact , that the heterogenous group of UNK is not sufficiently characterized at present , suggested to investigate the bcl - 2 expression in osteosarcoma .    2.9863433676379127
sixteen cases ( 46 % ) showed a strong expression of bcl - 2 and 13 cases ( 35 % ) were moderately positiv for bcl - 2 .    2.8046715821006343
seven cases ( 19 % ) were negative for bcl - 2 .    3.2139680341582313
the heterogenous , negative up to strong expression of bcl - 2 yield clues , that the bcl - 2 controlled regulation of programmed cell death could be an important factor of cellular kinetics .    2.3108850990174328
additionally the cellular proliferationrate was determined with the UNK antibody mib 1 , directed against the ki - 67 UNK .    2.3957777219710175
to verify the importance of apoptosis in the genesis of mesenchymal tumors and whether bcl - 2 may play an important role as a predictive factor for the prognosis of osteosarcoma , further investigations will be needed .    2.61988503961637
during a period of two weeks in hot dry UNK 3 patients presented in our pediatric outpatient clinic after a bath in a small UNK .    2.1630433499139343
they had an extremely itching , elevated exanthema mainly on their legs .    2.211805201212715
the single UNK had a diameter of about 1 - 3 cm .    2.7909168581115025
there were no signs of infection or fever .    2.7313742822697082
intussusception of the appendix UNK in adults is an uncommon event .    2.6798812164831625
the combination of a mucinous cystadenoma with an UNK appendix is extremely rare .    2.4306341297658975
clinical symptoms are nonspecific ; in most cases the correct diagnosis is not made before surgical exploration .    2.57325294821355
with the radiologic and endoscopic presentation of a polypoid lesion of the UNK , a neoplasm is often considered .    3.2765464019901276
endoscopic appendectomy or UNK by UNK have been described .    3.300227184225715
thus the definitive therapy is surgery and depends on the histological diagnosis .    2.8510374406788594
there are some case reports about excessive heat production in the absorbent canister when sevoflurane or enflurane are UNK into a circle containing dried soda lime .    1.9460126374631075
this observation was often made in the dräger iso 8 circle system with the gas inlet UNK of the soda lime canister with the gas - flow from bottom to top .    2.298067564423831
abstract : mr - imaging of the spinal column using turbo - spin - echo - sequences ( UNK ) often shows flow - UNK structures resembling UNK vessels .    2.4420718825567267
due to misinterpretation of those phenomenons invasive diagnostic procedures may be performed to diagnose an arteriovenous malformation ( UNK , spinal angiography ) .    2.4018115751354663
purpose : to compare the effectiveness of spiral ct versus conventional ct in the preoperative assessment of metallic intraocular foreign bodies .    2.6613263200086505
surgery is still the primary therapeutic approach in treatment of tumors in the head and neck area , dating back to the early nineteenth century .    2.635641646789597
more than 150 years ago , UNK and mandibular resections as well as UNK were already performed by leading surgeons .    2.992328178884724
ablative oncologic surgery has always been closely linked with plastic and reconstructive surgery , rendering radical surgical interventions possible without UNK patients .    1.9977102156886801
the development of facial reconstructive surgery UNK in stages , in the first instance as secondary reconstruction using tube pedicled flaps .    2.682644714963649
the change to the concept of primary reconstruction occurred via UNK skin flaps and myocutaneous flaps to the widely accepted and performed free tissue transfer .    2.229921794785242
free bone grafting , inaugurated earlier and still representing the majority of bone grafting , has been supplemented for certain reconstructive purposes by free vascularized bone transfer from various donor sites .    2.2637216748603004
although the five - year - survival rate of carcinoma of the oral cavity has remained unchanged in the past 30 years , distinctive improvements in tumor surgery can be recorded .    2.802769860674289
this is primarily based on improved diagnostics such as modern imaging techniques and the refinement of surgical techniques .    2.382441087287108
the dösak has worked out distinctive guidelines for effective ablative oncologic surgery .    2.154937250246704
surgical approaches offering wide exposure and carrying low morbidity play a decisive role in radical resections .    2.048462727309699
for this reason , midfacial UNK offers an essential improvement for the resection of midface tumors , especially from an aesthetic point of view .    2.022490793342855
tumors situated deep behind the UNK at the skull base can be clearly exposed either through a lateral approach following a temporary osteotomy of the mandibular ramus or a UNK , UNK , or UNK approach with minimal morbidity .    2.6183854891102447
concerning the concept of neck dissection , radical techniques are more and more abandoned in favor of a more conservative procedure .    2.6070995623968183
actual UNK concerning present surgical procedures as to the surgical strategy in " no - neck " or marginal and segmental resection in mandibular adherent carcinomas demand scientific clarification .    1.9959562534350965
laser treatment of various skin changes has become common clinical practice in recent years .    2.466120903096176
due to its physical properties , the co2 laser is particularly well suited for cutting and UNK tissue .    2.406649460152671
the high absorption of its wavelength in water ( = UNK nm ) is responsible for its low penetration depth in biological tissue .    2.0607544230843975
shortening the exposure time minimizes thermal side effects , such as UNK and coagulation .    2.8931595125937073
this effect can be UNK with the silktouch scanner , since the focussed laser beam is moved over a defined area by rapidly rotating UNK .    2.405166410485801
this enables a controlled and reliable removal of various dermal lesions .    2.2434541642609704
particularly well - suited for treatment hypertrophic scars , post - acne scarring , perioral and periorbital UNK , UNK and benign neoplasms including verruca vulgaris .    2.283189419511369
cosmetically favorable UNK of the treated skin surfaces occurs within a very short time after treatment .    2.848088141309882
periorbital resurfacing and correction of a rhinophyma are used as examples of dermal treatment with the co2 laser and the silktouch scanner .    2.4279166823068308
acute spinal cord injury affects more than 3000 individuals per year with predominantly young people between 15 and 20 years of age being involved .    2.0202996307749483
analysis of the modern emergency management has revealed that the prognosis of acute spinal trauma depends decisively on the initial treatment at the accident site as well as good acute emergency care .    2.6368260416664597
therefore , there is the urgent need to brain the medical staff so that injuries are diagnosed correctly and appropriate treatment be performed .    2.265113228969113
the first hours after the accident are decisive , because injuries due to the primary and especially secondary trauma are difficult to correct later .    2.637545799515388
besides the fate of the individual patient , the care provider has to be aware of the high economic impact caused by intensive care , long lasting rehabilitation , as well as post rehabilitative care .    2.9024118966903756
chronic or repeated stress can induce a damage of neurons , UNK in hippocampus , by which the degree of damage differs in various species .    2.319174119987941
UNK has reported that there is a correlation between hippocampal degeneration , disturbed UNK - back reaction , and UNK of glucocorticoids .    2.7066378948036087
introduction : the treatment of soft tissue defects of the foot and ankle region remains a challenge , because special anatomical and physiological properties have to be considered .    2.5530197214245263
patients and methods : the data of 52 patients , who were treated between 1994 and 1998 , were analyzed .    2.9626916255934277
48 % were posttraumatic defects and were located in the weight bearing zone in 37 % .    2.383989608360815
results : fifty - nine procedures were used , including skin transplantation in 16 patients , local flaps in 3 cases , regional flaps in 14 cases , and microvascular procedures in 17 cases .    2.217729490100326
amputation was required in 4 patients .    3.2541165914205417
the overall success rate was 92 % .    2.5095768376208674
complications occurred in 18 patients .    2.9606751889769005
conclusions : using these data and evaluation of the actual literature lead to the development of an algorithm for the treatment of defects in this area .    3.3623226305867986
recording of the eeg would be easier if a small number of channels was sufficient .    2.437717707369111
aiming at reduction of channels , leads from different regions of the scalp were analysed visually and with regard to their spectral content .    2.4445626295036607
apc resistance was first discovered in 1993 .    2.5803373640080633
it is the most frequent cause of UNK in europe and north america .    3.1300802868054114
in more than 90 % of cases , the underlying cause of apc resistance is a single point mutation in the factor v gene .    2.629275819537886
heterozygous patients have a between five - and ten - fold higher risk of developing venous thrombosis , while in homozygous patients the risk is increased up to between 50 - and 100 - fold .    2.386674407656733
where there is a previous history of thrombosis , a careful investigation of the coagulation system , in particular a determination of the apc ratio , is recommended prior to surgery .    2.810044137594532
in patients with apc resistance , a body - weight - specific thrombosis prophylaxis with heparin is recommended .    2.436839162313928
heterozygous patients only need anticoagulation when additional risk conditions are present , while homozygous patients with thromboembolic disease should be anticoagulated over a long period of time .    2.0369158922770776
primary varicosis of the saphenous system should be treated promptly by surgery to minimize the additional risk of thrombotic complications .    2.3819646419063143
pyomyositis is an acute bacterial infection with abscess formation in the skeletal muscles mostly due to staphylococcus aureus .    2.2609816734817487
the disease is found more often in males .    2.7567594106807727
furthermore , cases of pyomyositis are rare in non - tropical countries and some physicians may not be familiar with it .    2.508039487733823
if not diagnosed and treated properly , pyomyositis can lead to sepsis and death .    2.4084776720009287
although the pathogenesis of the disease has not yet been clarified , some predisposing factors of forensic interest are well known : ( trivial ) trauma or UNK exercise of the affected skeletal muscles , small potentially " septic " foci in other tissues or internal organs and a preexisting immunodeficiency , e . g . in diabetes mellitus , intravenous drug UNK or individuals suffering from hiv .    2.1973982755144355
three cases of " non - tropical " pyomyositis with fatal outcome are presented and the literature on the subject is reviewed with special reference to epidemiological and etiological factors , taking forensic aspects , histomorphologic findings and the problems of post - mortem diagnosis of pyomyositis into consideration .    2.3438056687585225
aim of the study : the etiology of persistent UNK during early infancy has been only insufficiently elucidated .    2.3301755762582426
based upon recent data from the " munich interdisciplinary research and intervention program ( UNK ) " , this paper shall discuss and challenge well known explanatory models .    2.2880681688403754
in addition , novel approaches of intervention shall be presented .    2.128874550098265
because tumour cell invasion is a three - dimensional process involving tumour cells as well as stromal cells , tumour invasion models should include UNK of both compartments in a UNK defined organisation .    2.5553891668177786
aims : evaluation of differentiation and invasive potential in relation to basement membrane ( bm ) formation of new human oral squamous cell carcinoma ( oscc ) cell lines under the influence of fibromatosis fibroblasts in a 3d co - culture system ( collagen type i / fibroblast - containing matrix ) .    2.0139306072725547
material and methods : oscc cell lines were established and cultured on collagen type i matrix with and without the inclusion of fibro - / myofibroblasts derived from nodular palmar fibromatosis ) .    2.0623468033472516
evaluation of invasion was done by conventional h & e staining after paraffin embedding ; immunohistochemistry was performed for cytokeratins ( UNK 116 ) , involucrin ( UNK ) , vimentin ( UNK ) , collagen type iv ( UNK ) , laminin ( 1 - chain , UNK ) , and ki - 67 ( mib1 ) ; and electron microscopy followed .    2.710176176688437
results : the oscc cell lines pe / ca - UNK , pe / ca - UNK , pe / ca - UNK were invasive exclusively on gels containing fibroblasts with stratification of the UNK oscc cell coat and UNK expression of cytokeratin and involucrin .    2.105687524485672
there was no evidence for bm , either by immunohistochemistry or by electron microscopy , although oscc are immunohistochemically positive for collagen type iv and laminin in the 2d cell culture .    1.9383576436141416
there were no differences in proliferative activity of the gels with and without fibroblasts .    2.4442303617639407
conclusions : carcinoma cell invasion depends on the presence of fibroblasts in the gel indicating the important role of tumor stromal fibro - / myofibroblasts during UNK invasion .    2.3087478200274574
the absence of a bm does not , per se , imply an invasive tumour growth .    2.3274068536157495
moreover , stratification and UNK differentiation of epithelial tumour cells occur independently of a structural bm .    2.0631282443382566
interfragmentary movement and size of the fracture gap influence fracture healing .    2.8053773569172415
limited movements promote callus formation and may result in increased mechanical stability .    2.5065193502588077
although larger movements still promote callus formation , the bony consolidation of the fracture is hampered .    2.584724978145028
fracture healing is also hampered if the size of the fracture gap is too large .    2.640432600852834
a combination of large movement and large gap bears the risk of non - union .    3.1475235401735513
therefore , having in mind a minimally invasive surgical approach , one should strive for good reduction of the fracture ends and flexible yet stable osteosynthesis .    2.3707458794700873
dynamization of the fracture by enabling axial movement will close the fracture gap , stimulate tissue differentiation and possibly accelerate the healing process .    2.1870215038548357
external mechanical stimulation , however , has not been shown to effectively enhance the healing process under flexible fixation or in load - bearing patients .    2.7427483495002543
although ketamine has been in clinical use for 3 decades , the UNK basis of its analgesic , anaesthetic , UNK , and psychotomimetic effects is still a subject of controversial discussion and intensive investigational efforts .    2.608183142374624
in recent years , however , new experimental approaches to its effects on the cellular and molecular level and the availability of pure ketamine enantiomers contributed substantially to the understanding of its complex UNK .    2.4364483284902376
this article reviews the current knowledge of ketamine effects on UNK - operated and voltage - operated transmembrane ion channels , g - protein - coupled receptors , transmitter uptake , and the no - cgmp system in neurons .    2.1143497017217947
with regard to its potential clinical relevance and supposed relative role among the complex mechanisms involved in pain perception , analgesia , anaesthesia , and UNK , the contributions of recent experimental and clinical findings to the identification of major target sites of ketamine are UNK .    2.5474212236447356
in contrast to the uncertainty surrounding the potential role of opioid receptors , there is now considerable evidence that nmda antagonism is a central mechanism that contributes to the UNK , analgesic , anaesthetic , and psychotomimetic as well as the neuroprotective actions of ketamine .    2.4858108611314855
moreover , the involvement of non - nmda glutamate receptors , UNK and nicotinic cholinergic transmission , interactions with 5 - ht receptors , and l - type ca2 + channels may account for some of its anaesthetic and neuroprotective properties .    2.3316141392874195
there is undoubtedly a need for a safe disinfection method of optical instruments used by ent specialists .    2.3357320740986345
so far , a standard method that sufficiently covers the risk of infection for patients and medical staff alike while serving the need of practicability in daily routine has not been established .    2.5347991651553143
therefore , in the ent departments of the hospitals of mannheim , UNK , and tübingen , studies on the disinfection of rigid optical instruments without working channel were performed between february 1999 and may 1999 .    2.3876967598106122
instruments were UNK either with an aldehyde or alcohol ( ethanol 80 % ) and germs were detected by quantitative swab cultures .    2.3252399152507452
as discussed in the article , disinfection with ethanol proved to be at least equally efficient if not better than disinfection with aldehyde .    2.265225501926729
therefore , it fully serves the requirements of a safe method for disinfection optical instruments without working channels .    2.146165088335892
white piedra is a rare hair infection of man and certain animals , caused by the widespread UNK fungi .    2.699837475821158
the infection is characterized clinically by whitish , soft and easily UNK coating of the hair shafts ; however , the shafts may be destroyed by the pathogens invading at localized points .    2.180911588272742
while all body hair may be affected , the pubic hair is most frequently affected .    2.2683145311854838
this paper is the first report genital white piedra in a 34 - year - old central european man .    2.4853707995802954
in all , 22 cases have been described world - wide in young men ranging in age from 20 to 40 years .    2.3440458107875295
only 2 men , aged 42 and 53 years , do not fall in this range .    2.076544085602957
recently , a major african study disclosed this disease in women for the first time .    2.2879242608341825
in moderate UNK , however , this infection appears to occur almost exclusively in young men .    2.783180023468055
in spite of this positive state of affairs the condition is still encountered often enough to warrant specific treatment strategies and techniques .    2.01015106593501
in the treatment of infected pseudarthroses the general principles of osteitis treatment are applied .    2.389242166120969
this includes radical excision of infected UNK bone and of the diseased surrounding soft tissue , provides mechanical stability in the non - union area and requires effective local treatment of the infection in combination with systemic , target - specific and temporary well - defined antibiotic therapy as well as procedures to improve local circulation .    2.603601241241318
the incorporation of autogenous bone transplants in defects appears to depend on close contact between the transplant and the vascularized receiving site and on the quantity of the transplanted osseous material .    2.171650994702761
a promising alternative method of dealing with extensive bone defects is osteogenesis produced by callus distraction ; therefore special attention is given to UNK ' s ring fixation system .    2.17989013308771
unstable scar formation demands local muscular flaps or UNK free flap transfer , which seems to be superior to other methods .    2.5197511230111136
aim of the study : using phantom studies , a dedicated low - field mr system with 0 . 2 t and a whole - body mr - scanner with 1 . 0 t were compared .    2.4327142882519177
among chronic complications , the diabetic foot syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of hospitalization .    2.597240405258714
the relative risk of diabetic patients requiring an amputation is up to 45 times greater than in normal subjects .    1.9977787293129192
sensory neuropathy , ischemia , and infection are the principal pathogenetic factors in the diabetic foot syndrome .    2.27946668266288
in most cases , a painless trauma is the initial condition that leads to an ulcer .    2.450351126524463
in this article , an overview of the different causes , clinical manifestations , and treatment options for a multidisciplinary team are discussed .    2.469408175231811
lung resection offers the best prospect of long - term survival in patients with UNK pulmonary neoplasia .    3.2138352646395454
in view of the dismal prognosis of UNK bronchial cancer , surgical resection should be encouraged even in patients with reduced cardiopulmonary function .    2.620453243414811
accurate estimation of the postoperative cardiopulmonary function is therefore desirable to avoid ( a ) refusal of potentially curative treatment and ( b ) severe postoperative disability .    2.3677434273458107
the origins of UNK morbidity and mortality are multifactorial .    2.7000774872331856
thus , no single pulmonary function test or hemodynamic measurement can accurately and reliably predict postoperative cardiorespiratory complications .    1.9333558896039724
exercise testing offers the advantage that both pulmonary and cardiac risk can be evaluated simultaneously .    2.395935928756251
the high predictive value of maximal oxygen uptake ( vo2max ) in assessing postoperative morbidity and mortality is established .    2.5563895084959793
the calculation of predicted postoperative lung function ( ppo ) is of importance .    2.314095990544164
the postoperative values for the forced expiratory volume in one second ( fev1 - ppo ) , the transfer factor ( tl , co - ppo ) , and vo2max - ppo can be predicted by using the same formula .    2.5752434116093696
patients with nearly normal lung function ( fev1 , tl , co > 75 % predicted ) and no concomitant cardiac disease can undergo lung resection right up to pneumonectomy without further diagnostic procedures .    2.019858590331623
in the others , fev1 - ppo and tl , co - ppo should be estimated first by taking into account the number of segments to be resected .    2.356537448022464
patients with values < 30 % predicted are usually regarded as being inoperable , whereas values > 40 % predicted qualify for resection without the need for further diagnostics .    2.2035420411289355
vo2max < 10 ml / kg / min or < 40 % predicted are UNK for surgery .    2.5427493651934157
if vo2max is > 20 ml / kg / min or > 75 % predicted , functional operability without limitation is given .    2.1111999682076057
for those cases where diagnostic uncertainty still remains , fev1 - ppo , tl , co - ppo , and vo2max - ppo can be calculated by means of quantitative lung scans .    2.224948840003599
patients with either fev1 - ppo and tl , co - ppo < 30 % predicted or vo2max - ppo < 8 ml / kg / min or < 35 % predicted are deemed inoperable .    2.13882141906373
the treatment of acute of achilles tendon rupture experienced a dynamic development in the last ten years .    2.5220771506611386
decisive for this development was the application of mri and above all the ultrasonography in the diagnostics of the pathological changes and injuries of tendons .    2.5596058314614867
the question of UNK morphology as well as different courses of healing could be now evaluated objectively .    2.457496038924811
these advances led consequently to new modalities in treatment concepts and rehabilitation protocols .    2.158684838236775
the decisive input for improvements of the outcome results and particularly the shortening of the rehabilitation period came with introduction of the early functional treatment in contrast to immobilizing plaster treatment .    2.511570917725462
in a prospective randomized study ( 1987 - 1989 ) at the trauma dept .    2.4105560278185294
of the hannover medical school could show no statistical differences comparing functional non - operative with functional operative therapy with a special therapy UNK ( UNK / UNK ) .    2.4330452098685913
the crucial criteria for therapy selection results from the UNK measured position of the tendon stumps in plantar flexion ( 20 ° ) .    2.58976677085067
with complete adaptation of the tendons ' ends surgical treatment does not achieve better results than non - operative functional treatment in term of tendon healing and functional outcome .    2.1127347873121085
regarding the current therapeutic standards each method has is advantages and disadvantages .    2.3663938243177567
both , the operative and non - operative functional treatment enable a stable tendon healing with a low risk of UNK ( 1 - 2 % ) .    3.164908121400989
meanwhile there is consensus for early functional aftertreatment of the operated achilles ' tendons .    2.2516852111566674
there seems to be a trend towards non - operative functional treatment in cases of UNK UNK findings , or to minimal invasive surgical techniques .    3.2308814530672296
based on a case report , we offer brief guidelines on the perioperative management of patients with sleep - apnea - syndrome ( sas ) who present with a high incidence of a difficult airway and a high risk of respiratory depression during the perioperative period .    2.80490252336642
a 39 year old male patient with a body mass index of 34 , 22 kg / m2 and receiving continuous - positive - airway - pressure - ( cpap ) therapy for known sas was scheduled for elective plastic surgery .    2.156090271035475
after induction of anaesthesia and direct laryngoscopy no adequate airway could be established and the patient became hypoxic , UNK and developed hypotension and bradycardia .    2.6974870311402497
with the use of a laryngeal mask airway the patient was stabilized and did not show neurologic UNK after immediate awakening .    2.9401051263662157
the following fiberoptic intubation of the awake patient , still showing tendency of upper airway obstruction , confirmed the difficult anatomical structures .    2.1209775081058075
the subsequent general anesthesia was uneventful .    2.5556569640760864
the patient received cpap therapy and was monitored during the first postoperative night in the intensive care unit .    2.3936965063900053
he made an uneventful recovery .    2.5978967667891504
he was advised to have regional anaesthesia or planned fiberoptic intubation , where possible , in the case of further anesthetic intervention .    2.4435569516372864
sas has major implications for the anaesthesiologist and whenever patients exhibiting the high risk factors ( obesity , male sex , history of intense snoring , impaired daytime performance , UNK daytime UNK ) are presented for surgery this condition should be considered .    2.195442440246685
elective surgery should be postponed until after adequate examination and treatment when necessary .    2.468618410562725
patients with sas should always be suspected of having cardiopulmonary dysfunctions such as hypertension , cardiac dysrhythmia or cor UNK .    2.0193244434309534
it is most important to avoid sedative premedication , to initiate cpap therapy preoperatively , to encourage regional anaesthesia if possible and to ensure close monitoring over the complete perioperative period .    1.9720988386527978
planned fiberoptic intubation , preferably with surgical personnel available for an emergency airway , is a safe method for the induction of anaesthesia .    2.591984928148573
postoperatively , patients are at high risk from respiratory depression , even in the awake state .    2.995520074708417
postoperative opioid analgesia , no matter what route , should only be given under close monitoring .    2.290126954311151
independently of regional or general anaesthesia there is an increased risk of respiratory depression in the middle of the first postoperative week , suspected to be caused by the catching up on lost rem - sleep , due to shifts in the normal sleep pattern during the first postoperative days .    2.715796559050357
life style measures ( weight reduction and control , reduction of total fat calories to < 30 % of total calories , modification of fat intake to increased UNK UNK fat , increased intake of dietary fibers , increased physical activity , controlled stress relaxation ) are the basis of longterm therapy of coronary heart disease .    2.165082926524839
for transformation to daily life both patient and doctor need motivation , information , UNK , and realistic UNK .    2.5230346738293448
for realization the 10 rules of medical information should be followed .    2.4482404365482067
the patient must be informed that the " new lifestyle " is not UNK but means a new quality of life .    2.2657602071803895
with respect to the most important metabolic syndrome with UNK due to insulin resistance , weight reduction is the most important measure for preventing complications of atherosclerosis .    2.927034876874845
the patient should use a diary for weight control and blood pressure UNK .    2.2691114719172467
iol implantation in childhood is still controversial .    2.7682857630878157
background : increases in serum calcium are often detected by chance .    2.1985694524582797
they warrant a prompt diagnostic work - up to identify the underlying cause .    2.8202399210068707
in the present review we describe our experience with debridement in necrotizing pancreatitis , with particular emphasis on the indications for surgery and the outcome in patients with infected and sterile necrosis .    2.947928274217594
within 7 years 64 patients with necrotizing pancreatitis underwent surgery with a median preoperative apache ii score of 9 .    2.454160778763718
the indications for surgery were either proven infection or persistence of symptoms .    2.3172840257995513
thirty - six patients were found to have infected necrosis , while 28 patients had sterile necrosis .    2.3511704630680574
there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding pre - and postoperative parameters .    2.492171472788535
the surgical technique involved a blunt necrosectomy followed by closed UNK with UNK drains .    2.392695683897943
this technique produced the lowest reported mortality of 6 . 2 % with a reoperation rate of only 17 % , demonstrating that even with sterile necrosis surgical management can be carried out safely .    2.4766766551368447
therefore , the prevention of such episodes is of great clinical importance .    2.6801063108277208
the absorption of large volumes of irrigation fluid is a major problem in transurethral prostatic surgery ( tur - p ) .    2.27266453416713
various indicators have been tested to monitor fluid absorption with regard to continuous registration and sufficient accuracy .    2.4232429112185128
the volumetric fluid balance is not suitable as a routine method because of its inaccuracy .    2.5834135655753236
easily accessible parameters are unspecific because of surgical bleeding ( haematocrit [ hct ] ) , or are UNK with by physiological counter - regulatory actions ( serum sodium [ na ] concentration ) .    1.8738783333550078
in 1986 UNK et al .    2.444598848007303
suggested adding 2 % ethanol to the irrigation fluid as a marker and investigated it intermittently in the expired air with an alcohol - test appliance .    2.051248875076902
in a prospective clinical study of 17 patients undergoing tur - p under spinal anaesthesia , expiratory concentrations of alcohol that was added to the irrigation fluid ( 2 % ethanol in UNK , UNK , bad homburg ) were monitored .    2.432854114139234
gas was continuously sampled from the nasopharynx through a nasal cannula and the ethanol concentration was measured using a modified UNK anaesthetic gas monitor ( normac , datex , UNK ) that allows continuous as well as early detection of the absorbed irrigation fluid with reliable accuracy for clinical use .    2.3055011725776002
in addition , at intervals of 10 minutes we measured blood alcohol , UNK alcohol ( alcotest 7110 , UNK ; UNK , lübeck ) , haematocrit , serum na concentration , and blood gases .    2.060436248129147
sixty - eight measurements were obtained from the 17 patients .    2.614110524258701
in contrast , the expiratory alcohol measurements with the alcotest 7110 ( r2 = 0 . 93 ) and normac devices ( r2 = 0 . 85 ) were closely related .    2.333416148432869
continuous monitoring of the expiratory alcohol concentration with a normac monitor closely reflects blood alcohol concentrations , and may hence serve as a useful semiquantitative monitor of irrigation fluid absorption during tur - p .    2.0971387923930105
between 1986 and 1996 , 21 patients had a UNK arthrodesis .    3.1127662878593085
indications for surgery were in all cases either osteomyelitis or avascular necrosis of the talus .    2.7496538589577457
external stabilisation was used in 17 patients due to severe soft tissue damage or extensive infection of the talus , internal screw fixation was used in four patients .    3.049259771436673
there were eight complications in seven patients , one patient had a below the knee amputation .    2.6116344017312296
the leg length discrepancies after resection of the talus was UNK in four cases with callus distraction using an ilisarov ring fixator .    2.932007227337323
follow up evaluation was available in 18 patients after an average of 38 months ( 12 - 86 UNK . ) .    2.4847008091757883
there were no infectious UNK during the follow up period and a solid fusion was achieved in all patients that were followed .    2.864661178206534
according to a modified kitaoka score , results were excellent and good in 12 of the UNK .    2.6444866841729957
external stabilisation , especially the ilisarov ring fixator is the primary method of treatment in cases with severe infection or soft tissue damage .    2.9256590186104456
intraoperative autotransfusion ( mat ) , preoperative autologous blood donation , and preoperative UNK haemodilution are three different methods to avoid homologous blood transfusion during surgical procedures .    1.9696443588031347
the controversial use of mat via cell UNK in tumour surgery as well as contamination of the operative field with urine illustrate the particular difficulties of autologous blood transfusion in connection with radical prostatectomy .    2.4387001309320055
we investigated changes in the osmotic resistance of the UNK red blood cells ( rbc ) , bacterial contamination , changes in coagulation parameters , and the presence of tumour cells .    3.0664829926503794
orbital pseudotumor is a nonspecific inflammatory process of unknown etiology that can be divided histopathologically into three basic types : granulomatous , lymphoid , and sclerosing .    2.2634120066169703
between 1995 and 1998 , 12 patients with pseudotumor orbitae were treated in the ent department of the university of saarland .    2.9349461094194313
histopathological examination showed granulomatous type of pseudotumor in six , lymphoid in three , and sclerosing in three patients .    2.2287639653153164
in seven cases the pseudotumor orbitae were medially located and in four cases UNK .    2.248212522630396
in one patient nearly all orbital structures were infiltrated .    2.321634060297969
a number of different mapping systems have been published for the lymph - node staging in lung cancer .    2.688435376456174
the use of a reproducible map is an essential prerequisite for correct determination of the tnm status and comparing the surgical results .    2.5789792650566947
in order to evaluate the current status of lymph - node mapping and lymph - node dissection in germany , we performed a UNK survey involving 90 hospitals performing operations for lung cancer .    2.5316141307682636
responses were obtained from 61 ( 67 . 7 % ) hospitals .    2.828288596331251
currently , the majority of the departments ( 43 % ) use the german staging system ( according to the deutsche gesellschaft für thorax - , herz - und UNK / UNK ) , 23 % lymph - node mapping according to UNK , and 25 % an individual description of the resected lymph nodes .    2.9041198601698968
mediastinal lymph - node sampling guided by the intraoperative aspect of lymph nodes is performed in 59 % of the departments .    2.8981732969533116
a systematic mediastinal " en - bloc " resection is accomplished in 41 % .    2.114186836038256
the results of this survey represent the current status of lymph - node mapping and lymphadenectomy in lung cancer in germany and might be useful for the development of a uniform staging system .    2.4984573572285362
in a 4 - year period two right - sided UNK occurred following a total of 39 UNK for lung cancer .    2.81804400973311
in another case pneumonectomy was performed for left - sided lung cancer with concomitant empyema as an emergency procedure in a patient referred from an outside hospital .    2.3863498149325615
empyema was treated with repeated thoracoscopic debridements and intermittent lavage with UNK - iodine solution and UNK / UNK .    2.5497901352084806
three to seven UNK were required to UNK the pleural cavity .    2.763363431963673
UNK is suitable for definitive treatment of UNK empyema and is associated with excellent functional and cosmetic results .    2.7917317892906044
injuries to the spine and the spinal cord are an important problem .    3.2477696135168
in the present paper the application of external transpedicular fixation of the spinal column for surgical treatment of patients in the acute phase of spinal cord injuries is described .    3.2803742909883797
the results of treatment obtained in 54 patients in the acute phase are presented .    2.7367546142825954
decompression of the spinal cord can be accomplished by way of a dorsal approach .    2.82751637729656
in this way it is possible to remove the compressing factor in stages .    2.6958673508968487
positive results were achieved in the late phase in 84 . 22 % of patients with acute spinal and spinal cord injuries .    3.116705984075079
objectives : children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia ( all ) or non - hodgkin lymphoma ( nhl ) show retarded growth .    2.1365335911356778
the question arose as to whether UNK catch - up growth follows .    2.2528451233070372
background : the fundus autofluorescence imaging technique has been modified allowing improved image resolution ( 768 x UNK pixel ) .    1.8950127302096484
we present results of fundus autofluorescence studies using this technique .    2.2153303952457297
certain intra - articular fractures of the knee can be managed by arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation .    2.742456535378465
the known benefits of arthroscopy include better visualization of the entire joint , limited dissection , and thorough irrigation .    2.2992884801276974
the purpose of this paper is to present our experience with arthroscopically assisted reduction and fixation of certain intra - articular fractures of the knee .    2.4894347077383205
from may 1995 to november 1997 , 34 patients with intra - articular fractures of the knee were treated by arthroscopic reduction and fixation .    2.6856637801452874
we treated 11 patients with tibial plateau fracture type i , ii and iii ( according to j . UNK classification ) , 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the tibial insertion of the anterior cruciate ligament ( intercondylar UNK ) type ii , iii and iv ( according to meyers , UNK and UNK classification ) , two patients with completely dislocated osteochondral UNK fractures of the femoral condyle , and one patient with a minimally displaced fracture of the patella .    2.825883966951851
postoperatively they were all allowed passive motion exercises .    2.3416406991117693
patients with avulsion fractures of the acl and the patient with fracture of the patella were allowed immediate weight bearing , while patients with tibial plateau fractures and osteochondral fractures were allowed weight bearing only after 12 weeks .    2.581963856038326
results : of the 11 tibial plateau fractures , 8 were anatomically reduced , and in 2 the dislocation was less than 2 mm .    2.626627361149059
no further dislocation of the fragment followed .    3.135099560199848
all patients but one reported stable knees and they all had a full range of motion at follow - up .    2.172756749432846
of the 20 patients with avulsion fracture of the anterior cruciate ligament , 19 were anatomically reduced .    2.7169060241310037
except in one patient , functional results were excellent ( UNK was 1 . 3 mm , average loss of flexion was 2 . 5 ° , loss of extension was 1 . 3 ° ) .    2.9805953935801743
in two cases of osteochondral fractures of the femoral condyle , reduction was anatomical .    2.964663003084294
the fractures healed , the patients were free of pain and had full rom at the follow - up .    2.8072259199852434
the fracture of the patella healed in 4 weeks with full rom of the knee .    2.607379079740979
there was one case of aseptic synovitis and no other major complications .    2.5405436203045744
conclusions : arthroscopic reduction and fixation are technically possible in certain types of intra - articular fractures of the knee .    2.3944972750562212
provided indications are good , results of arthroscopic treatment are better than in classical surgical treatment through arthrotomy .    2.379839243676902
there is less postoperative morbidity , and hospitalization and total rehabilitation times are shorter .    2.261181432358859
some technical hints are presented .    2.6303020416538234
a healthy 38 - year - old woman suffered a sudden cardiac arrest 2 days after a vaginal hysterectomy .    2.4994369097731375
although standard cardiac life support ( cpr ) was instituted immediately after the event , it was not possible to re - establish a spontaneous circulation for about 40 min .    2.3955135074538076
systemic intravenous thrombolytic therapy with slow injection of 1 . 5 million iu urokinase was performed as a final life - maintaining measure because of the high probability that the underlying cause was a pulmonary embolus ; 10 min later ( after 60 min of ongoing cpr ) the patient regained a stable circulation .    2.4098438189971527
she survived without neurological deficit in spite of the long duration of cpr .    2.754206256812244
in UNK patients with an initial diagnosis of rectal carcinoma operated on between 1985 and 1994 we investigated the quality of lymph node dissection , its influence on the perioperative risk and tumor staging .    3.322460185946247
the same histopathological work - up was carried out in all cases .    3.2682604823321233
whether resections or UNK were performed , the number of dissected lymph nodes increased from 5 . 3 and ( 1985 / 1986 ) to 16 . 7 and 17 . 3 ( 1991 / 1992 ) and to 15 . 8 and 17 . 3 ( 1993 / 1994 ) respectively .    2.577240268053647
neither the type of operation nor the surgeon ' s experience had a significant influence on the number of lymph nodes dissected .    2.970502012291449
the increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected had no negative effect on the length of the operation , the amount of blood infused during the operation or the perioperative risk .    3.116716301914371
we found a significant correlation between the number of lymph nodes dissected and the number of lymph node metastases ( p = 0 . 02 ) and between an increase in uicc stage iii ( p = 0 . 005 ) and UNK tumors ( p = 0 . 000 ) and an increase in the number of lymph nodes dissected .    3.1631686947595106
central lymph node dissection by high ligation of the inferior mesenteric artery did not increase the perioperative risk in spite of the fact that in recent years we have observed more patients with multiple diseases .    2.969237715436495
with the institution of the protection against infection act , case definitions will be officially introduced for the routine transmission of UNK infectious diseases from local health departments to state and national health institutions in germany for the first time .    1.9614238405341684
case definitions link the disease entity with a defined description of the disease .    2.5568439830064533
the abstraction thereby required leads to the creation of nosological entities .    2.3305118814328267
the case definitions , which were developed by the robert koch institute ( rki ) according to the protection against infection act , enable the local health departments to assess and UNK reported cases , deaths and laboratory reports of pathogens according to uniform criteria prior to transmission to the rki via the state health institutions . the quality of surveillance data will be significantly improved , as each reported case / infection will fulfil defined criteria , thereby enabling unclear cases / diagnoses to be separated from those that are confirmed .    1.8846121223367513
endosseous osseointegrated implants have become an integral part of the treatment scheme for the prosthetic reconstruction and rehabilitation of masticatory function following scientific studies of the reactions between implant and soft and hard tissues .    2.2971952336166854
furthermore , implants offer good chances for prosthetic rehabilitation in the insufficient bone site , if the extremely atrophic jaw is to be reconstructed by grafting procedures with avascular and vascular grafts , by guided bone regeneration , by distraction osteogenesis , by bone substitutes and in the future by osteoinductive proteins in order to prepare the conditions for implant insertion .    2.1736302654638613
those reconstruction procedures combined with implants become often necessary , if complicated hard and soft tissue defects of the skull have to be reconstructed to create the prerequisites for the stabilisation of UNK or to insert implant - supported devices .    2.516034246616891
a 58 - year - old woman was initially externally diagnosed in 1983 with a presacral mass , which was subsequently treated as an UNK .    2.5539268358687672
thereafter , the patient experienced recurrent perianal fistulas .    3.155878193123914
further diagnostic studies revealed a cystic tumor , considered to be an epidermoid cyst , which was located in the inferior pelvis and was consequently removed .    2.7655052308582153
histologically , cystic scar tissue was found with a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma which measured 4 cm .    2.3873709452090015
later on , the patient again experienced perianal fistulas originating from a renewed presacral mass .    2.528281160679522
as a result , an abdominal - perianal rectum extirpation and a partial resection of the sacrum with placement of a UNK were done .    2.6754888892061266
histologically , adenocarcinoma tissue was found at the base of a tail - gut cyst .    2.4226190359160293
one year following her operation , the patient is free from any complaints and relapses .    2.7826622599585815
the tail - gut cyst is a very rare entity which arises from the inadequate UNK of the tail - gut during embryonal development .    2.503505567224943
in the case of recurrent perianal fistulas and cystic masses between the rectum and os sacrum or os UNK , a tail - gut cyst should be taken into consideration , the goal being its complete removal .    2.200306880796916
the german social law has required quality assurance ( qa ) procedures since 1989 .    2.0124671429821888
the measures must be suitable to allow " comparing investigations " .    2.257185095500685
in 1992 the german society of anaesthesiology and intensive care medicine published recommendations for qa in anaesthesia : most problems during an anaesthetic should be documented in a standardised manner , and thus , a list of 63 pitfalls , events , and complications ( pecs ) and five degrees of severity were defined .    2.1834741394333563
the goal of this study was to determine the frequency of pecs in anaesthesia and to correlate pecs with procedures and preoperative health status .    2.37077252294874
using the diary method , the correlation between daily mood and everyday activities is analyzed .    2.2022398325789667
positive and negative affect were used as indicator of daily mood .    2.495493048500456
duration of social activities and resting during the day were used as indicator of daily activities .    2.41179643126284
a total of 55 elderly persons kept a activity and mood diary for at least 50 days .    2.1783918397078463
the data were analyzed UNK ( using regression analyses ) and intraindividually ( using time series analyses ) .    2.077087434584385
while positive affect and duration of social activities correlate positively in both inter - and intraindividual perspective , there is a relationship between negative affect and duration of rest only in interindividual perspective .    2.3787194517371493
theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed .    2.9763299454790477
purpose : regional hyperthermia in combination with chemotherapy or / and radiotherapy is a promising treatment concept for locally advanced , deep - seated tumors .    2.310003894690641
the purpose of the project is the optimization of the therapy using non - invasive , three - dimensional imaging of tissue changes or of the temperature distribution during regional hyperthermia .    2.506753793249932
the purpose of the transfusion law , which came into force on 7 july 1998 , is to ensure the supply with safe blood products , to UNK the confidence in the blood transfusion system , and to support self sufficiency with blood and plasma .    2.2008637406198606
in order to reach this goal , the law regulates the essential UNK for the adequate collection of blood and blood UNK , as well for safe usage of blood products .    2.497413129677065
moreover it UNK down rules for look - back procedures , UNK the collection of data on the epidemiology in donor populations , creates a legal basis for the advisory group ' UNK UNK ' , and UNK the self sufficiency with blood and plasma by several prescriptions .    2.2797077597804756
in the last decades back pain has reached dramatic proportions in industrialized countries .    2.300785199584386
disorders of the back are nowadays the leading cause of direct and indirect health care costs .    2.309648509027877
a review of epidemiologic studies in the general population reveals that back pain has reached a prevalence of 40 % for current pain .    2.3944536690818676
7 to 18 % are " frequently " , " often " , " daily " or " constantly " affected .    2.4639753275936234
75 % of the adult population suffers from back pain during the last year .    3.1628539009587726
80 to 90 % of the adult population in industrialized countries experience back pain ever .    2.858653551570729
gender specific differences are only present in severe , chronic forms which are more often experienced by women .    2.2467306577164865
back pain has a prevalence maximum at 50 to 64 years .    2.414589570233599
older persons display lower prevalence estimates .    2.4798322610495056
the prevalence maximum in men is one decade earlier than in women .    2.17420905545201
there are several potential explanations for this prevalence pattern that are discussed in the article .    2.4088515563709025
back pain can be classified by location , temporal characteristics , pain intensity and pain history .    2.2732127257906485
currently , for none of these dimensions generally accepted , uniformly employed and validated definitions are available .    2.145569681541134
in most of the industrialized countries back pain is one of the most expensive symptoms .    2.9220515850877917
75 - 90 % of the direct and indirect health care costs were caused by those 5 - 10 % of patients who are disabled .    3.363287567895881
as predictors of back pain a history of back pain and job satisfaction play by far a more important role than the extensively studied mechanical factors .    2.2723183411651875
for a first episode of back pain the prognosis is favorable .    2.6791553123027754
if the pain persist for more than three months the prognosis is unfavorable .    2.731045486452744
after six months of UNK because of back pain more than half of the afflicted never return to work .    2.6156281281174554
rarely back pain is present as a single symptom .    2.980925236312841
in more than 80 % back pain is associated with pain in at least one joint .    3.1617141071426973
it remains to be studied if back pain may be viewed as an entity or as part of a more complex pain syndrome .    2.4500737778945036
chronic low back pain can be considered to be one of the most frequently treated and most costly diseases in modern industrial societies .    2.7571758419141656
dysfunctions and imbalances of the spine - supporting muscles increase the risk of low back pain .    2.7194907996531215
consequently preventive treatment and rehabilitation have to aim at preserving and restoring the full capacity of the spine - supporting muscles as well as training coordination and spine - UNK behaviour .    2.276634967600301
in addition to various measures of pain therapy , physiotherapeutic treatment including neuro - physiotherapy , physical treatment ( UNK UNK ) , UNK and supportive behavioural training , medical rehabilitation therapy ( mrt ) ranks among the most effective ways of treating low back pain .    2.5321738082894276
mrt applies guidelines and methods of exercise methodology within medically indicated programmes of preventive treatment and rehabilitation .    2.0314682923322724
various objectives of mrt are outlined with special regard to the stages of mrt treatment , emphasizing positive adaptation of the neuro - muscular system in the course of rehabilitation .    2.3458430404353097
physicians are responsible for mrt diagnosis and control .    2.706729343527749
a 39 - year - old female patient presented with an intense allergic reaction and shock after UNK sunflower seeds and simultaneously acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) .    2.1517564762238903
skin tests and cap specific .    2.650341221213612
ige demonstrated an ige - mediated sensibilization to sunflower seeds .    2.2535117035021988
when sunflower seeds were UNK alone , only discrete paresthesias of the oral mucosa occurred .    2.291833992397516
surprisingly , an oral challenge with asa was well tolerated .    2.452984722324466
the supplementary UNK of asa to the allergic reaction was done - dependent .    2.2332685276536792
the quantity of the allergen also modified the intensity of the symptoms .    2.537116744389294
this surprising effect of asa may be attributed to increased gastric resorption of the allergens .    2.1891213965273972
axillary lymph node dissection for node sampling is one of the most important staging procedures when mammary carcinoma is treated surgically .    2.5502950550441614
periprosthetic femoral fractures present the problem of fracture treatment and prosthetic stability .    2.561938535386392
various treatment options are recommended for managing these fractures .    2.630077170069499
we treated 51 patients with 54 periprosthetic fractures between 1985 and 1995 .    2.2252677757912496
of these , 42 ( 78 % ) fractures were treated with a plate , eight ( 14 % ) , with a revision prosthesis , two ( 4 % ) , with retrograde nailing , and two ( 4 % ) , conservatively due to poor medical condition .    2.71486190246963
the choice of fracture management was dependent on the type and location of the fracture and on the stability of the prosthesis .    3.2231776722074796
a total of 50 fractures healed primarily .    2.508143296549571
complications included three cases of plate loosening , one further fracture , one deep infection , one broken bolt and one varus deformity .    2.08666593969294
four patients died in the postoperative period , an additional 19 were dead at the time of the evaluation .    2.823393262781776
fractures with a stable implant can be treated with plate fixation .    2.961815567536082
cases of a loose implant require revision .    2.7085977694310737
distal fractures are stabilized with a plate or with a retrograde nail .    2.5258354681026662
a young patient who underwent renewed aortic valve replacement after already open UNK of the aortic valve and following valve replacement with enlargement of the ascending thoracic UNK by using a pericardium patch had taken place is reported .    2.566921866919808
in the area of this enlargement by the pericardium patch , the development of an aneurysm was seen and was resected in the same setting without any difficulties .    2.573137029477041
the particular items with special regard to the postoperative course are delineated in the following report .    2.901261944757327
the situation of oncological surgery in germany was evaluated by sending a questionnaire in january 1998 to 1979 registered surgical clinics .    2.2491908106617218
a total of UNK responded and stated that they are involved in that field .    2.4622058688752113
in 72 % of the departments oncological surgery adds up to 10 - 30 % of their overall work .    2.904905921054502
colorectal surgery is 93 % and is the leading topographical field in oncological surgery .    2.396803433540818
73 % of the hospitals regularly perform gastric tumor surgery .    3.2997903270509195
the proportion of hospitals with breast surgery is surprisingly high ( 45 % ) .    2.268267772841155
many hospitals ( 54 . 6 % ) report neoadjuvant treatment regimens .    2.719540022451215
together with adjuvant therapy this rate amounts to 85 . 2 % .    2.4974767175038384
the diagnostic spectrum of the hospitals involved in the UNK is UNK .    4.048783477070908
however , the modern possibilities of network and UNK are not sufficiently used .    2.681287360585983
the surgeon ' s position concerning the speciality " surgical oncology " is UNK : only 35 . 3 % of the department UNK support this speciality - and over 90 % of the departments reject the structural independence of " surgical oncology " from " visceral surgery " .    2.2866004841546506
cryosurgery is a widely accepted modality for the treatment of capillary hemangiomas of the newborn .    2.9556551233821606
however , no studies clearly supporting its effectivity are available .    2.2289097990960007
actuarial 6 - 12 month survival of such patients is reduced to 50 - 75 % .    2.5527716279925223
since introduction of triple immunosuppression including cyclosporine , azathioprine and corticosteroids heart transplantation has been established as treatment of choice for patients with advanced heart failure refractory to medical treatment .    2.4330981286800206
however , the increasing imbalance between demand and supply of suitable donor organs limits the number of patients for this therapeutic option and requires a more restrictive UNK of patients for heart transplantation .    2.35823482241691
the conservativ medical therapy was improved by application of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and UNK UNK .    2.3867813625149137
alternativ surgical therapies of advanced heart failure include high risk bypass surgery , high risk valve surgery , mechanical assist devices , implantable cardioverter - defibrillators , partial left UNK , UNK and UNK - pacing .    2.36648219251855
they serve as bridge to transplantation or medium - and long - term alternatives to heart transplantation .    2.406942812484228
the therapeutic success is determined by adequate selection of patients for the respective therapy .    2.755104667526766
this requires the implementation of risk scores on the basis of national and international registries of patients with advanced heart failure .    2.911179029977631
motion analysis of the cervical spine is a sensitive tool in the fields of preventive and clinical biomechanics of whiplash .    2.7939316406258436
in the field of preventive biomechanics motion analysis contributes to validation and UNK of UNK based crash test experiments and UNK .    2.415912825393683
in the clinical field motion analysis up to now is of restricted value .    2.5798373063022018
data exist about restrictions and pathologies of movement and motion of the cervical spine , UNK disturbances , postural control , tmj - function and oculomotor disturbances after whiplash .    2.052492085009847
the standardisation of technical and clinical set - ups is necessary to establish a well proven UNK model of whiplash and whiplash related biomechanical dysfunction .    2.2679897325493394
without this model the value of motion analysis for clinical use will be restricted due to lack of comparable data on sensitivity and specificity although motion analysis of the cervical spine is neither cost - nor time consuming and free of adverse effects .    2.362629049624531
within a prospective series of 28 patients ( 14 m / 14 f ) with a follow - up to six weeks we were lucky to describe UNK two different types of reaction to low energy ( v < 20 km / h ) rear end collision : type i with disturbances in complex movements only , type ii with overall restriction of movement .    2.224625402782831
control of angular velocity during cyclic movements of the head was disturbed by oscillations of higher frequency in all patients .    2.3618581585480447
recovery from whiplash within 6 weeks could be monitored .    2.4825556098738173
diagnosis of parasomnias in the sleep laboratory is difficult since the nocturnal behavior reported by the patients often does not show up in the laboratory .    2.2930336182264717
to test the efficacy of sleep deprivation as a tool to provoke somnambulism we investigated ten patients ( three women and seven men , mean age 27 + / - 3 . 4 ) with somnambulism .    2.5538825138756964
their standard UNK and UNK nocturnal behavior was compared to that of sex - and age - matched controls and to polysomnography and behavior after sleep deprivation .    2.590915937891597
patients with parasomnias and controls did not show significant differences in sleep parameters with the exception of longer arousal duration in controls , which was nonsignificant .    2.5473643417884952
in magnetic resonance tomography , patients with parasomnias did not reveal abnormality of the brain that might explain release of nocturnal behavior .    2.750188929024042
sleep deprivation led to significantly reduced number of arousals , reduced arousal index , significantly prolonged arousal duration and more stage shifts from all sleep stages ( nonsignificant ) .    1.8716186853085859
complex behavior during sleep increased under sleep deprivation , whereas sleepwalking did not increase .    2.285605673236946
the majority of complex behavior during sleep is triggered by stage shifts and not by arousal in the sense of the arousal definition of the american sleep disorder society .    2.1969043850310945
complex behavior in sleep is UNK and UNK .    2.83246878506304
its complexity seems to depend on the duration and intensity of arousals .    2.7433606880211348
sleep deprivation can be recommended as an efficacious method of increasing complex behavior in sleep , which is a preliminary stage of sleepwalking .    2.4887930114969827
concerning the underlying pathology it seems to be important to register the quality and duration of stimuli that trigger arousals instead of focusing the number of arousals alone .    2.8397450496716052
introduction : in order to investigate whether operative technique determines the 5 - year recurrence and survival rates , we analysed the results obtained by two surgical departments using two different operative techniques .    2.576608525572864
department a : removal of the tumour and a number of lymph nodes ; department b : en - bloc resection in accordance with the requirements of standardised tumour surgery .    2.7911698294697214
patients and methods : the surgical results obtained with all patients with colorectal carcinoma operated on between 1984 and 1988 ( department a : 152 colon and 53 rectal carcinomas ; department b : 124 colon and 177 rectal carcinomas ) .    2.1125749918922927
results : the local recurrence rate achieved by department a was signicantly higher ( colon carcinoma : department a 25 % ; department b 10 % ; rectal carcinoma : department a 54 % ; department b 16 % ) .    1.9992571381422386
the 5 - year survival rate for colon carcinoma was 65 % in department a , and 66 % in department b , the corresponding figures for rectal carcinoma being 49 % and 72 % , respectively .    2.021485993610613
definition of the problem : ethics consultation is one of the most important ways in which clinical ethicists can support both health - care providers and patients and their relatives in coping with ethical and existential challenges .    2.133516203633733
the practice of ethics consultation , as performed at the freiburg university hospital is described and illustrated by a case report about the problem of treatment termination .    2.656533393045413
the range of subject matters that come up in ethics consultations is analyzed .    2.192756806568711
a research program in clinical ethics is summarized that has been undertaken to pave the way for a specific and interdisciplinary analysis of needs ; from there on , the investigation aims at further developing clinical ethics support services .    1.954694621534919
suggestions for criteria of competence for ethics UNK are formulated on the basis of both the author ' s and international work .    2.617610190336324
finally , the issues of structural conditions for establishing clinical ethics in the german - speaking world are raised and the long - term prospect of ethics consultation as an instrument for learning and teaching ethics in the health - care system is highlighted .    2.272632180435662
objectives bridging of an extensive bone defect with a long stem revision prosthesis anchored in the diaphysis to restore a pain free function of the limb .    2.311128622267817
a total of 205 patients suffering from stage i and stage ii melanoma were investigated with reference to psychosocial stress , social support and attitude to offers of psychotherapeutic support .    2.2998314161218163
additional counselling by their dermatologist was considered helpful by 59 % of the patients , and interviews with a psychotherapist , by 20 % .    2.5464059068186295
patients who where more anxious about a progression of the cancer and thought they had not been given sufficient information about their illness preferred to seek help from the dermatologist .    2.0608017593616705
patients who appreciated additional counselling by a psychotherapist were usually those with a poorer prognosis for their melanoma and those on whom psychosocial distress weighed especially heavily and who had less social support .    1.9108712999741975
the original structure of the synovial membrane is completely destroyed in the rheumatoid synovium and is characterized by UNK cell infiltration , UNK proliferation , neo - vascularization , and deposition of extracellular matrix proteins .    2.258443189197303
adhesion molecules play an important role in the development of these pathologic changes .    3.090272622061408
in this review we discuss the role of the adhesion receptors of the selectin , UNK and UNK families and of the cd44 molecule in the cell - cell and cell - matrix interaction in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory changes in rheumatoid arthritis .    2.541135520566356
during the last five years several authors have reported largely satisfactory results , using the steroid intravenous anaesthetic eltanolone ( UNK ) for induction of anaesthesia after administering a bolus dose .    2.3770545679183765
until now , however , no investigations have been undertaken , dealing with the infusion pharmacokinetics of eltanolone after arterial blood sampling and using slow induction to quantify the concentration - effect relationship .    2.196529296993447
secondary objectives were to assess the haemodynamic and respiratory effects .    2.920063933965076
background : intraoperative measurements of local UNK hemoglobin oxygenation of the human cochlea via the round window membrane have been shown to be possible using the erlangen microlight - guided spectrophotometer .    2.1913213489647365
the aim of the present study was to develop a new microlight guide suitable for measurements in the round window niche and to evaluate UNK the possible impact of the procedure on the cochlea .    2.3796579755300837
however , some patients do not respond well to this new therapy .    2.3423190262624227
we attempted to further characterize the non - UNK population in a retrospective study .    2.9581386425065657
two closely matched groups of responders ( n = 20 ) and non - responders ( n = 20 ) were compared .    2.8726055929454786
however , non - responders were characterized by a highly elevated atopic score , and by high levels of total ige and of specific ige .    2.706680113430283
furthermore , colonization of the skin with staphylococcus aureus occured at higher densities , and intestinal growth of candida albicans was more frequently observed .    2.347998189577438
these data indicate that high - dose uva1 irradiation is not effective in all patients suffering from atopic dermatitis .    3.0196448664053253
we conclude that non - responders with complicating infections might benefit from the combination of high - dose uva1 therapy and antibiotic or antimycotic treatment .    2.4308486215082956
introduction : many causes are given as the main reason for inadequate pain therapy .    2.4742234834785504
the objective of our study was to demonstrate the current position of doctors in general practice all over austria who prescribe prescriptions .    2.2186555106506116
we report a woman with erythema UNK UNK , an anomaly not documented so far in the german literature .    2.570659509866821
it is characterized by a bright erythema of the palms , usually persistent since birth .    2.2533028496344674
it is transmitted in an autosomal - recessive mode and has a benign course .    2.5569988512551403
in our patient it was possible to trace the palmar erythema over three generations .    2.4081723083364914
the decline of std in the region of rostock , germany , since 1945 is explained by a decreasing incidence of UNK and UNK .    2.503521252005131
on the other hand chlamydial and candidal infections have increased .    2.143885564446989
the rate of chlamydia infections was about 45 % in our UNK patients , as common as UNK used to be .    2.5507341643893713
genital candidal infections were to be found in 23 % .    2.9639306138314687
UNK were identified in 15 % , usually combined with other pathogens except in some cases of UNK .    3.0995826023791895
the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of hodgkin ' s disease and non - hodgkin ' s lymphoma has changed considerably in the last few decades .    3.0723101639602133
clinical observation of mainly UNK pathogenesis with continuous expansion and subclinical involvement of adjoining regions of lymph nodes has resulted in the introduction of a large - field technique with total nodal irradiation ( UNK ) or total lymphatic irradiation ( UNK ) .    2.4176121870932366
the introduction of polychemotherapy has led to further improvement in the cure rate and in considerations concerning using both methods and adapting them to the stage and risk .    2.275888211376054
today the combination of radiation and chemotherapy leads to a reduction in the amount of radiation required in the affected regions ( involved field irradiation = UNK ) .    2.79940937982719
the german society of oral and maxillofacial surgery was founded by martin waßmund in UNK .    2.3059757219495136
one of the main reasons was the need for scientific representation in the council at a medical convention .    2.5393816768581616
the society , originally composed of 52 members , was first called " the german society of maxillofacial surgery " .    2.1628011007040406
in 1972 , it extended its UNK to include the term " oral " ( " mund " ) and currently comprises UNK members .    2.2069282364679785
a scientific conference is held annually on a specific topic .    2.235030782869153
topics of choice are published in " mund , - kiefer - und UNK " ( " oral and maxillofacial surgery " ) , originally by UNK in munich and now by springer - verlag in heidelberg .    2.298512399859395
in this manner , it was possible to completely document the scientific activities and progress in this specialty .    2.328624269641057
each year since 1957 , a prize named after m . waßmund , has been given for outstanding scientific UNK .    2.133675643126297
the UNK , convention locations , topics , and UNK are listed in a table .    2.926417088092025
since the founding of the society of oral and maxillofacial surgery , close cooperation has existed with the national association of german oral and maxillary - facial surgeons ( UNK der UNK UNK für mund - kiefer - gesichts - chirurgie ) .    1.8008829236912702
in order to UNK scientific and political interests , a fusion of these two organizations is planned for the year 2000 .    2.283241838253653
the UNK syndrome is defined as the development of renal failure in patients with severe liver disease in the absence of any other identifiable cause of renal functional impairment .    3.387085833374852
the pathogenesis of this obviously functional renal failure is complex and not completely understood .    2.3553877994685504
of importance seems to be a peripheral and systemic vasodilatation with redistribution of blood volume .    2.6124535898214556
nitric oxide seems to play a major role as a possible primary mediator .    2.6962961678376423
supportive treatment and intensive monitoring of the cardiovascular circulation is the main goal in the care of these patients .    2.9778431714653335
the mortality is still high exceeding 90 % .    2.508385870238717
renal extracorporeal support should be initiated using a continuous method when recovery of liver function is expected ( acute liver failure , waiting for liver transplantation ) .    2.050805480152976
the only effective and permanent treatment is orthotopic liver transplantation .    2.3681104029082
a 16 year old patient with the typical clinical signs of albright ' s hereditary UNK developed series of epileptic seizures with loss of consciousness , tonic muscle contractions and bite of the tongue .    2.3741677346297183
after termination of the seizures there was coma without focal neurological signs .    2.286359046440207
ct scan revealed diffuse brain edema .    2.624914403931697
electroencephalographic studies showed generalized slowing .    2.664454627728013
in laboratory tests the only abnormalities were marked hypocalcemia ( 1 . 15 mmol / l ) and UNK .    2.7072719703011954
blood parathyroid hormone ( pth ) was elevated .    2.421308263907332
pth - test confirmed the diagnosis of UNK .    3.1566592026141818
the patient was treated with calcium and 1 , 25 - UNK - UNK .    3.0907387066454746
after few days the severe encephalopathy , ct and electroencephalographic changes were completely reversible .    2.254890718317567
hereditary disturbances of the parathyroid hormone metabolism are rare diseases .    2.7606453586185866
hypocalcemia must be included into the differential diagnosis of seizures and brain edema to avoid invasive diagnostic and UNK treatment .    2.4326987406441343
an adequate increase of uterine blood flow throughout gestation is essential for uterine , placental and fetal growth .    2.2084822848541146
maternal cardiovascular adaptation has to provide the uterine perfusion that is necessary to meet the requirements of the developing and growing fetus by providing transport of nutrients and oxygen to the placenta and the fetus .    2.2466390904640394
thus uterine blood flow is inextricably linked to fetal growth and survival .    2.44505428796288
reductions of uterine blood flow can occur under acute or chronic conditions or in a combination of both .    2.6138706155253075
chronic reductions of uterine blood flow can be observed in pregnancy induced UNK ( UNK ) , diabetes mellitus in pregnancy and intrauterine growth restriction ( iugr ) .    2.6535381464891152
in view of a possible stent implantation , 20 infrarenal abdominal aneurysms obtained consecutively during postmortem examinations were investigated .    2.0778233084892173
measurements were performed according to UNK criteria on the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysms as well as on their lengths and diameters .    2.7423687448293466
then we correlated the extent of the proximal and distal necks to the aneurysmal lengths and diameters , respectively .    2.447760128705153
the following results were obtained : 1 .    2.9411581141558183
depending on the increase in length of the infrarenal abdominal aneurysm , there is an UNK shortening of the proximal and distal neck .    3.367901259187196
up to an aneurysmal length of 4 cm both proximal and distant necks are suitable for stent fixation in all cases .    2.2362399628726055
with lengths of more than 4 cm according to the morphological results , the distal neck is almost always unsuitable for fixation of a simple tube - stent .    2.4315730426237874
the proximal neck is suitable for stent fixation in all cases up to an aneurysmal length of 10 cm .    2.534021852699337
for longer aneurysms , only a quarter of all cases is suitable for stent implantation .    2.8806932948517554
in all cases investigated there were severe arteriosclerotic changes with atheromatous ulcerations and secondary wall - adherent thrombi of up to three UNK thickness in the aneurysmal and para - aneurysmal regions .    1.9801125798396957
these findings have to be considered , with respect to the transluminal transport of the prosthesis as well as in the regions of the supposed implantation in the proximal and distal necks of the aneurysm with individually variable arteriosclerotic changes of the aorta .    3.024247661539399
we report on a case of paraganglioma of the cauda equina in a 48 - year - old man .    2.4311161142932534
these slow - growing , mostly benign and encapsulated UNK - UNK tumours are clinically characterized by UNK , paraesthesia and motor deficits as well as UNK - UNK by incontinence .    3.0178748953383514
paragangliomas of the cauda equina show UNK ( main ) cells arranged in a typical cell cluster pattern , demonstrating a lobular architecture and a fine net of connective tissue formed by so - called sustentacular cells ; some tumours show focal UNK differentiation .    1.8247032171729591
because of their morphological similarity to the more common UNK , paragangliomas of the cauda equina are sometimes misdiagnosed so that their incidence is likely to be higher than previously estimated .    2.254193942577472
immunohistochemistry findings are positive for neuron - specific enolase , UNK and other neuronal markers as well as neuropeptides ( main cells ) and s - 100 protein ( sustentacular cells ) while widely lacking reactivity for gfap .    2.3323624987533256
paragangliomas of the cauda equina represent a rare entity , of which only 80 cases have been described in the literature .    2.415990706362381
because they only occur sporadically , they are often not included in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions of the region of the cauda equina .    2.9427598228336063
approximately one out of every three patients with carcinoma of the cervix must be expected to experience a recurrence .    2.6182268315185464
the treatment of such relapses is dependent on the site and extension of the recurrence , the type of primary therapy administered and the patient ' s general condition .    2.7748625770660755
the limit conditions for the application of the established forms of therapy available - surgical operation , radiotherapy , chemotherapy - are complex and seldom documented by randomized studies .    2.387451350938882
in general , empiric observations and historical analyses determine the backdrop against which therapy is planned .    1.9873863990295202
the main experiences available are compiled in this paper to give a basis for individual treatment of patients with recurrences .    2.9222983197160564
post - traumatic pyogenic liver abscess is a rare disease .    2.8127846944153876
we present the case of a 38 - year - old man with multilocular liver abscess and pleural empyema following blunt abdominal trauma .    2.283426608444776
the patient had a UNK lasting 3 months before presenting in our department .    2.418219841738414
the therapy included partial hepatectomy and pleural drainage .    2.2577445196242203
clinical signs , diagnosis and possible therapy are discussed in this case report .    3.684741754177668
the dream of every hospital computer scientist is a completely computerized flow of information in his / her facility : admission , diagnosis , treatment , transfer , and discharge of patients .    2.113738767256986
however , in developing such general hospital information systems , one runs into the following problems : ( 1 ) medical and administrative information systems form a very heterogeneous environment ; ( 2 ) the structure of medical information is extremely complex , except for certain limited administrative data ( admission , transfer , and discharge , for example ) needed by the clinic administration .    2.082721132743433
one cannot expect a universal solution to this problem within the next few years .    2.2093104919654456
therefore we present a concept which , based on existing tools , allows communication between medical information systems .    2.361086100527671
shave excision of nevi is a technique still under debate .    2.249897535672307
speed , simplicity , and the fact that it provides excised material for histologic examination are contrasted with the lack of excision margins and a higher rate of nevus recurrences .    2.608855438763241
in this study , the pros and cons of shave excision were evaluated .    2.1241043630170204
the congenital UNK UNK represent a group of rare inborn errors with ineffective erythropoiesis as the predominant mechanism of anemia .    2.2553430279680318
they are primarily classified into three types on the basis of characteristic abnormalities of the erythroblasts as shown by light and electron microscopy .    2.4499761756271674
there are distinct associated features such as pattern of heredity , cell kinetics and abnormalities of the cell membrane .    2.2388118665170444
recently variant genes have been localized to different regions on chromosome 15 or 22 .    2.171192882588462
cases of cda were reported from many UNK , in particular in families of UNK origin .    2.6931446389809373
many patients load iron necessitating iron depletion .    2.3376533907507193
gallstones are a frequent complication and are observed in childhood or adolescence .    2.5241002310642893
therapeutic measures such as splenectomy , treatment by interferon or allogeneic UNK marrow transplantation depend on the type and the severity of clinical expression , which shows large variations both within and between affected UNK .    2.2317135677344786
UNK is a constant in aging .    2.7661927127346484
observed over long periods , it can reach 1 % per year .    2.486542494859447
but it is such a UNK phenomenon that it cannot be observed over short periods at steady state .    2.2394248371612506
the aging phenomenon mainly UNK fibers , type ii but on aged muscle thin , normal , and hypertrophic fibers UNK with sclerosis and fat increases .    1.9476728134205132
chronic venous insufficiency ( cvi ) is characterised by stage - dependent microangiopathy .    2.6550066819927136
with increasing severity there is a decrease in the number of skin capillaries and the oxygen partial pressure .    3.056218916405338
the cutaneous vascular reserve , which is measured by laser - doppler UNK , is reduced .    2.807215810584913
cutaneous microangiopathy is one of the main causes of the trophic disturbances associated with cvi .    2.575646233479885
low frequency pulsed current improves cutaneous microcirculation and thus nutrition as well as UNK the formation of granulation tissue .    2.5906500766406872
in a open prospective pilot study , 15 patients suffering from cvi with persistent leg ulcers were treated with low frequency pulsed current ( UNK ) , which is thought to improve particularly the tissue microcirculation .    2.775505628337595
the average age of the patients was 70 . 3 years and the average duration of ulceration was 79 . 1 months .    2.8862555422204825
the patients were treated over a period of 38 days .    3.0649983923018507
with this UNK , 2 ulcers healed completely and 13 showed a reduction of size of on average 63 % .    2.4618219269770965
capillary density increased by 43 . 5 % , while transcutaneous oxygen partial pressure increased by 82 . 4 % .    2.564095581419009
electrostimulation is a treatment with few or no side effects .    2.656888114342514
from 1986 to 1996 , we implanted a total of 92 hip arthroplasties ( 86 cementless , 4 hybrid and 2 cemented ) in 65 patients with rheumatoid arthritis .    2.149440603462471
of the 89 uncemented cups , 59 were threaded cups ( UNK - UNK n = 45 , zweymüller n = 7 , UNK n = 5 , pm n = 2 ) and 30 were UNK cups of the harris UNK type i and ii .    2.381544718429534
87 stems were implanted without cement ( zweymüller sl n = 58 , uni n = 16 , schenker n = 9 , zweymüller i n = 4 ) and 5 with cement .    2.141013598431411
to date , one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening ( revision rate approx .    2.1134043805398055
6 . 8 % ) ; up to now , three of 87 ( approx .    3.323697381324122
3 . 4 % ) stem revisions ( 1 x zweymüller i , 1 x schenker , 1 x zweymüller sl ) have been undertaken .    2.5847175796528785
ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow - up ; some of them had a poor general health status .    2.539080095864525
the clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a harris hip score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months ( min .    2.85747089759228
ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region .    2.4968596344703533
79 % of the uncemented implants ( 70 out of 89 cups , 69 out of 87 stems ) were assessed radiologically .    2.321114316554484
this subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and UNK of the hip joint .    2.9944271528790694
at final follow - up , approx .    3.183285698341414
75 % of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of UNK ( type i ) , approx .    2.7787640996258083
19 % had near - complete bone ingrowth with minimal radiolucencies in one zone or in a maximum of 50 % of the bone contact area ( type ii ) and approx .    2.4327027188808548
6 % had radiolucencies in more than 50 % of the bone contact area ( type iii ) .    2.777373752025144
the radiographic evaluation of the most frequently used stem ( zweymüller sl ) showed approx .    3.031597613741245

abstract the 5th edition of the tnm classification UNK a number of changes concerning head and neck tumors .    2.5505549146019724
the division of stage iv tumors into three subcategories marks a significant expansion of the stage grouping procedure .    2.067524887980167
methods : in a retrospective study the clinical course of UNK patients with head and neck carcinomas were comparatively evaluated according to the 4th and 5th UNK of the new tnm classification .    3.225701127572922
in particular it was the aim of the study to test the prognostic relevance of the UNK of stage iv especially in mucosal cancer .    3.0904752111561926
results : in classifying the primary tumor the most extensive changes were noted for supraglottic and salivary gland tumors .    2.1750605806671444
on the basis of the 4th edition of the tnm classification the following recurrence - free 5 - year survival rates for UNK cases of mucosal cancer were calculated : stage i 91 , 0 % , stage ii 78 , 6 % , stage iii 61 , 4 % , stage iv 31 , 0 % .    2.3446309434748858
the calculations based on the 5th edition yielded : stage i 91 , 0 % , stage ii 77 , 2 % , stage iii 61 , 2 % , stage iva 32 , 4 % , stage ivb 25 , 3 % , stage ivc 3 , 6 % .    2.784160926385576
conclusions : the adequacy of the revised stage classification in establishing a prognostic hierarchy was confirmed .    2.054517593783256
however , a significant prognostic distinction between n2 - ( stage iva ) and n3 - metastasis ( stage ivb ) could not be found .    2.2169864451763517
the microcirculation is the organ that provides the direct link between blood and tissue , and thereby between the whole organism and the single cell .    2.399243658124709
modern microcirculation research in experimental surgery is characterized by the use of high - resolution video fluorescence microscopy and quantitative computer - assisted image analysis coupled with the techniques of molecular biology and transgenic or knock - out gene technology .    2.2872582506914383
these advances should improve knowledge about surgically relevant physiologic and pathophysiologic phenomena at the interface between blood and tissues and help us to understand the initial molecular mechanisms leading to organ dysfunction following inflammation , ischemia - reperfusion , and transplantation .    1.8697316827926411
legal and moral considerations hinder the introduction of preimplantation genetic diagnosis ( pgd ) in germany .    2.3763816981145838
this article presents and discusses the ethical arguments for and against pgd .    2.2410942138038044
in the UNK ' s view neither the fact that pgd is not a well established technique nor the danger that single - cell - analysis may lead to misdiagnosis convincingly demonstrates that pgd is morally inacceptable .    2.7257744053428867
UNK in ethical positions which defend abortions but do not accept pgd are highlighted .    2.071407218866791
the use of arguments dealing with the prediction of negative social consequences after establishing pgd is UNK .    2.3257349630133666
extensive counselling prior to pgd should be implemented in order to help couples which want to use the new technique to make an autonomous decision .    2.358982377676839
the sofa score , a new system for patients with sepsis - related diseases , was introduced in 1994 by the " working group on sepsis - related problems of the european society of intensive care medicine . "    2.7128968206112254
the purpose of this study was to compare the new sofa score with the apache ii and mod scores .    2.064605312531989
the data on UNK patients from a surgical intensive care unit in an university hospital were analyzed using commercially available software ( spss for windows , version 7 . 5 . 2 and ms excel ' 97 ) .    2.2965483782991605
to compare the different scores , UNK - operating characteristics ( roc ) - analyses were applied .    2.595363406404654
the study demonstrated a clear correlation between an elevated sofa score and the mortality of the patients during their icu stay ( score 0 - > mortality 0 % , 1 - > 3 . 6 % , 2 - > 22 . 5 % , 3 - > 86 , 7 % , respectively r = 0 . 445 ; p = 0 , 01 ) .    2.934191343496876
the roc analyses of the apache ii , the mod and the sofa scores were comparable ( area under the curve : apache ii 0 . 73 , mod 0 . 77 , sofa 0 . 71 ) .    1.9137934460544148
in conclusion , the sofa score is reliable and might be useful in the daily routine of an intensive care unit .    2.3354946925696325
in individual patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas ( hnscc ) , established prognostic factors do not satisfactorily predict clinical outcome .    2.2512581624500125
for the first time we investigated a total of 100 hnscc by comparative genomic hybridization ( cgh ) to define chromosomal alterations that are associated with the patients prognosis .    2.4642996313150762
patients were followed for at latest 4 but at least 2 years after surgery or until death .    2.619834563761059
during this observation period twenty - nine of them died because of cancer disease .    2.6553048963062866
the kaplan - meier method was used UNK survival curves for every single chromosomal alteration as well as every clinico - pathological parameter .    2.313936819060249
the curves were tested for significance by the log rank as well as the breslow test .    2.494555022837061
the overall survival time as well as the recurrence free survival time were significantly lower in patients who ' s tumors showed UNK of the chromosomal region 11q13 ( p = 0 . 0008 for lr and p = 0 . UNK for b ) .    2.635103978435784
the survival time of the patients was also lower if the carcinomas carried UNK of chromosome 3q ( p = 0 . UNK for lr and p = 0 . UNK for b ) .    2.5581311199188708
multivariate analysis ( cox ' s proportional hazards model ) revealed both alterations as most important independent prognostic factors in hnscc .    2.00906965967424
none of the conventional clinico - pathological parameters ( pt - , pn - status , uicc stage , grading ) achieved statistical significance in the multivariate model .    1.975183494339542
we report a coincidence of balloon cell melanoma and balloon cell transformation in a dermal nevus of a 56 years old female patient .    2.249571940558346
the UNK cells in both tumors with different dignity expressed s - 100 and vimentin .    2.318013739715339
hmb45 was expressed in all balloon cells of the melanoma .    2.647798923972016
detection of hmb45 in some of the nevus - associated balloon cells was considered as an expression of cellular activation .    2.471422599058678
we present , to the best of our knowledge , the first case of a malignant , primary plaque - type blue naevus in a 61 - year - old male .    2.622767238711793
locally invasive growth and regional lymph node swelling were present , but these alone could not confirm malignancy before evaluation of all clinical and histopathological features , as they are known to occur with benign cellular blue naevi .    2.2813495282331915
the recent literature and our case indicate that there is a malignant potential in every histological and clinical variant of blue naevus .    2.4365061239265433
it is difficult to provide valid data with regard to changes in incidence and prevalence of acute pancreatitis in germany .    2.5937116468652617
the lack of information is due to strict legal regulations to protect personal data , a certain lack of interest in epidemiological research and the lack of exact statistics of diseases treated in hospitals .    2.34832000809133
the incidence of acute pancreatitis in other industrialized western countries is about 10 new cases per year and 100 , 000 inhabitants .    2.265465294224044
the increase of alcohol consumption over the last 30 years is associated with an increase of ethanol - induced pancreatitis .    2.889653355097442
one may UNK that due to improved diagnostic possibilities , such as ct scan , cases where acute pancreatitis is diagnosed at autopsy are rare .    2.386510462270073
due to the increase in alcohol consumption it can be assume that the incidence and prevalence of chronic pancreatitis have increased in germany similar to well - documented data from denmark .    2.64881813881
since alcohol consumption is slightly decreasing in germany it is likely that the present incidence of about 10 cases of chronic pancreatitis per 100 , 000 inhabitants will also decrease .    2.1993633412568827
process - experiential ( pe ) therapy is a neo - humanistic treatment that strives to maintain a creative tension between a client - centered emphasis on a genuine , UNK , empathic relationship and the active , task - focused process - directive style of gestalt therapie .    1.687606219458844
this form of treatment is scientifically validated ( grawe 1997 ) .    2.5526380885693496
its theory of function and dysfunction has been updated via contributions from contemporary psychological theory .    1.8405753433237964
it incorporates a set of key therapeutic tasks , each of which is characterized by specific client marker and resolution state , series of steps clients pass through on their way to resolution , and therapist interventions used to facilitate client progress through those steps .    1.600029800951323
this second part of the review provides an overview of specific therapeutic tasks .    2.842272242331947
at last suggestions for practical implementation are discussed , and available outcome data is summarized .    2.2782244707372215
the human arterial blood pressure shows not only UNK alterations , but also spontaneous fluctuations .    2.7472412281004703
a well - known phenomenon is the so - called " white coat UNK " which may severely affect diagnosis and therapy of essential hypertension .    2.5429177221818176
furthermore , several studies have provided evidence that the degree of end - organ damage in hypertensive patients is closely related to the UNK blood pressure variability .    3.0602961116678618
therefore , it is tempting to suggest that an optimal antihypertensive treatment should take an improvement of the blood pressure variability into consideration .    2.8337202825158525
the faeces sign is a recently described computed tomography ( ct ) feature of small - bowel obstruction and is seen as a UNK , faeces - like content within the lumen of the dilated loops above the level of the obstacle .    2.3283657429617057
to evaluate its prevalence , significance , and diagnostic value we retrospectively reviewed 94 consecutive cases of small - intestine obstruction studied with ct in the last 6 years .    2.282357885069654
the faeces sign was recognizable in 7 cases ( 7 . 4 % ) and was localized within ileal loops in all these subjects .    2.4669672377359526
in 6 of the 7 cases there was a simple and progressive obstruction , while there was a sudden onset with intestinal strangulation in only 1 .    2.5815161649250213
the faeces sign is due to the intraluminal stagnation of enteric material and is generally recognizable in subjects with subacute obstruction .    2.3066180221295447
in our experience it is relatively uncommon .    2.456037356995355
nevertheless , it seems to be rather specific and may be a valuable accessory feature in the ct study of small - bowel obstruction .    2.796091944605893
a case report is presented to illustrate the cutaneous manifestations in essential thrombocythaemia .    2.5512526820438572
treatment may prevent severe haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications .    2.354513556528485
UNK is causally related to thrombocythaemia ; prompt relief of painful symptoms after treatment with aspirin is typical .    2.145695965383226
surgical treatment of proximal aortic disease traditionally consists of UNK replacement of valve and aorta .    2.4817983996944952
recent reconstructive procedures on the aortic root allow for treatment of aortic dilatation and concomitant aortic valve regurgitation without the associated UNK of mechanical heart valves .    2.1663944416574012
two psychotic patients developed hyperglycaemia several weeks after starting olanzapine .    2.212122503623783
in one case the elevated glucose concentrations returned to normal soon after withdrawal of olanzapine .    2.1071187730608596
in the second case severe ketoacidosis with UNK outcome occured .    2.2345257878225997
UNK is a novel procedure allowing precise analysis of skin surface structure .    2.3914305648836875
during the subsequent analytical procedure the roughness is determined by means of a UNK .    2.8180262665313336
a commercially available statistics software program is used for statistical analysis of the results .    2.927560662458496
this procedure was applied to check for to evaluate positive effects of oestrogen UNK on the structure of the skin surface on the face .    2.9663196378144203
this article describes the historic roots of acetylsalicylic acid ( asa ) from the first experiments at UNK until the introduction into the pharmaceutical market in 1899 .    1.983376445701408
in 1869 , UNK UNK UNK the chemical structure of salicylic acid , which was used at that time as an analgetic and antipyretic drug .    2.6735490821973156
because of the side effects , for example the irritation of the stomach , analytical UNK and UNK searched for chemical modifications .    3.1644954206633495
in august 1897 UNK hoffmann ( UNK - UNK ) was successful in UNK the salicylic acid to UNK acid ( asa ) .    2.925380040456291
between 1897 and 1899 UNK UNK ( UNK - UNK ) collected clinical data and experiences on the efficiency of asa as an analgetic and antipyretic drug .    2.5285044136732
in 1899 asa was introduced into the UNK market as aspirin and became soon one of the most successful drugs of its time .    2.4806565615909286
the indication exceeds analgesia in the mean time and to prophylaxis of myocardial ischaemia or cerebral stroke , among others .    2.2601345898164094
background : the results of the UNK - UNK group showed that cryotherapy significantly reduces the rate of adverse morphological and functional outcome of eyes with threshold retinopathy of prematurity .    2.992789740795294
structural status and visual acuity of 48 eyes which consecutively underwent UNK in our hospital between 1990 and 1994 were examined at 2 years corrected gestational age .    2.213377698429842
despite wide - spread immunisation programs epidemic influenza continues to cause ten UNK of deaths worldwide , every year , especially in the high risk groups of elderly or immunocompromised persons .    2.245154785842288
at present , amantadine and UNK are the only approved agents available for prophylactic and therapeutic use , yet , the deployment of these substances is problematic : neither of the two drugs is effective against influenza b , their use is accompanied by rapid development of viral resistance , and they show many adverse effects .    2.22879005316283
in contrast , zanamivir and gs4071 / gs4104 are rationally developed influenza - specific neuraminidase inhibitors , proving prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against influenza a and b , as well in vitro as in animal models , and in experimental human studies .    2.154195818356892
zanamivir and gs4071 / gs4104 are well tolerated without adverse reactions after topic and oral administration , respectively .    1.9442562937444217
resistant viral strains have been found in cell culture in the presence of both drugs , but the frequency of resistance emergence during clinical use is unclear .    2.8925093688180326
as neuraminidase inhibitors up to now could mainly be assessed by experimental data , specifically performed clinical trials will have to prove the positive influence of these drugs on the morbidity , course of infection , and mortality of high risk persons when administered for prophylaxis as well as for therapy .    2.494392616026544
background and purpose : without recanalisation , acute basilar artery ( ba ) occlusion has a mortality of 90 % , which is reduced to 50 % if recanalisation is achieved .    2.327794193546487
fast diagnosis of ba occlusion is necessary in order to start thrombolytic therapy without delay .    2.6243459094194734
we wanted to assess the role of ct angiography ( UNK ) in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected acute ba occlusion .    3.4222450123879815
25 patients with coronary heart disease ( chd , 62 + / - 9 years ) and 18 subjects free from cardiovascular disease ( 28 + / - 9 years ) were tested on a cycle ergometer using a graded incremental test protocol : a ) in the common upright position , b ) as dynamic stress echocardiography in a semi - supine position .    2.5329219470306286
whereas no relevant differences could be detected between the two conditions for the healthy subjects concerning heart rate , blood pressure , and rate - pressure product ( 2 x 3 anova , t - test with - adjustment ) , the chd patients showed both significantly higher heart rates as well as a significantly higher rate - pressure product ( 50 w : 15 300 + / - UNK mmhg / min vs . 13 UNK + / - UNK mmhg / min ; 75 w : 18 UNK + / - UNK mmhg / min vs 16 UNK + / - UNK mmhg / min ) on equivalent stages during stress echocardiography if compared to the sitting position .    2.439718331910281
there were no differences for systolic blood pressure in this group ; the diastolic values were higher in the sitting position at rest and during 50 w . lactate concentrations ( determined only in the healthy subjects ) were significantly higher on all stages during dynamic stress echocardiography .    2.343528061331074
the workload at the individual anaerobic threshold ( UNK ) was significantly lower .    3.3665655641607777
a new UNK mixture of 27 % UNK - phosphate ( UNK ) and 73 % UNK - calcium - phosphate ( UNK ) can be prepared with water intraoperatively to a UNK that subsequently sets to a structurally UNK implant composed of hydroxyapatite ( ha ) .    2.328050267635809
primary setting time is about 20 min ; ph during setting ranges from 6 . 5 to 8 . 5 .    2.7806521286978314
there is no relevant UNK heat or expansion or contraction .    2.271313428400586
compressive strength is about 50 mpa , tensile strength about 8 mpa .    2.1148330110353264
over a period of about 4 h in physiological milieu , the cement UNK to hydroxyapatite .    2.2263081332436556
this product is no longer UNK in normal body fluid .    2.554231573223402
this cement can be used for non - load - bearing applications especially in craniofacial bone surgery .    2.6684176383830023
cranial defects due to tumour or trauma as well as deficits in the facial skeleton may be reconstructed using this new biomaterial .    2.5599449914349295
fluid control of the operation field and implant site is extremely important and sometimes difficult to achieve .    2.707856932551985
further applications could be all non - load - bearing augmentations such as filling of blocked paranasal sinuses , of UNK cysts and defects following dental UNK or fixation of implanted hearing - aid electrodes .    1.879691704517403
the perspectives for the hydroxyapatite cement include its application as a carrier for osteogenic protein preparations , especially because of its UNK reaction and intrinsic osteoconductive characteristics .    1.9589075795312525
we present a non - invasive epilepsy surgery protocol , which includes eeg - video - monitoring , magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) , interictal positron emission tomography ( pet ) and ictal single photon emission computerized tomography ( spect ) .    2.092379610323158
according to this non - invasive protocol 50 of 173 patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy underwent resective surgery .    2.2012581536414064
46 ( 92 % ) of the patients had temporal and 4 ( 8 % ) had UNK epilepsies .    3.3843876594241653
78 % ( n = 39 ) of all patients operated according to our non - invasive protocol were postoperatively completely or almost seizure free .    2.86842068509214
UNK resections could be carried out without invasive eeg - recording if the epileptogenic zone was not adjacent to the UNK cortex .    2.3818332347812974
we conclude from our results that in a considerable number of patients with medically intractable particularly temporal focal epilepsies , resective epilepsy surgery can be based on non - invasive eeg - evaluations and the risk of invasive recordings can be avoided .    2.6251174097397785
necrolytic migratory erythema ( nme ) is mostly associated with a pancreatic - a - cell - UNK and is considered to be a well - defined cutaneous paraneoplastic syndrome .    3.0127703649303808
we report on a 74 - year old female who atypically developed a nme after surgical treatment of a rectal adenocarcinoma .    2.6208810037453247
continuous staging and laboratory investigation over four years gave no evidence of any metastasis or further neoplasia .    2.230336598532953
hair samples and perspiration collected from long term drug addicts ( n = 18 ) under constant methadone treatment were investigated .    2.3251200137486676
hair segments representing the individual hair growth of 4 weeks were analyzed for methadone , opiates and cocaine by gc / ms .    2.1288470344353576
the results obtained from the transdermal collection devices confirmed the presence of drug substances in variable amounts on the skin surface , methadone being the main UNK .    2.4735741598501657
the perspiration test period lasted for 4 days .    2.4210921657659865
for six persons illicit drugs similar to those in the corresponding hair samples were found .    2.4154347218232735
overall , a poor relationship ( r = 0 , UNK ) was found between the methadone dose under steady state conditions and the methadone level in hair .    2.65773892157272
the results are discussed in the light of pharmacokinetic aspects , drug uptake by perspiration and forensic interpretation .    2.3027330375128954
bilateral carotid artery dissection is a rare and unusual complication of blunt UNK trauma .    2.6551572775003502
the diagnosis of a carotid injury is rarely suspected in trauma patients with neurological deficits .    2.463529050326283
neurological symptoms may develop in a delayed fashion .    2.5113978027998476
angiography should be considered in trauma patients with hemiplegia and a normal mental status and in patients with blunt cervical trauma with an abnormal neurological examination .    2.820218282897849
initial heparinisation can prevent arterial thrombosis and neurological deterioration .    2.3420205610184643
the authors report their findings which are based on 10 years of interdisciplinary cooperation in the treatment of chronic pain patients .    2.8078326317133935
they point out the practical use of their findings in daily practice .    2.4963488022382125
abdominal compartment syndrome is defined by increased intraabdominal pressure above 20 mmhg with increased pulmonary peak pressure and oliguria .    2.3587709897915174
in primary abdominal compartment syndrome the increased intraabdominal pressure is caused directly by peritonitis , ileus or abdominal and pelvic trauma .    2.103212704165683
secondary compartment syndrome is a result of forced closure of the abdominal wall after abdominal surgery .    3.074587708570719
the effects are decreased cardiac output , pulmonary atelectasis , oliguria to anuria and hepatic as well as intestinal reduction of perfusion .    2.2896313863938773
effective monitoring is done by standardised measuring of urinary bladder pressure .    2.376340836557619
normal values are between 0 and 7 cm h2o , after elective laparotomies 5 - 12 cm h20 .    2.340191164803939
above 25 cm h20 they are definitely pathological .    2.3860297534073176
for the prevention and therapy of manifested abdominal compartment syndrome the application of a laparostomy using a resorbable mesh is recommended .    2.7974260847574097
between 1988 and 1999 we applied a laparostomy to lower the intraabdominal pressure in UNK patients .    2.30886404377399
in 16 % of the cases it was indicated by primary abdominal compartment syndrome with a bladder pressure of 31 + / - 4 cm h20 preoperatively , which could be lowered to 17 + / - 4 cm h20 by laparostomy .    2.681384563204568
an early reconstruction of the abdominal wall could be performed in 18 % of the cases .    3.746427425023323
conclusions : the abdominal compartment syndrome is an often underestimated problem in abdominal surgery involving multiple organ systems .    2.299616324422009
the temporary laparostomy lowering intraabdominal pressure rather than a forced closure of the abdominal wall should be used in all circumstances .    2.6210453868471375
in general , assessment of the correct placement of a central venous catheter is performed by fluoroscopy or by UNK chest x - ray .    2.476164220455658
we report a case of intraaortic malposition of a central venous catheter in a 59 - year - old male patient that was not detectable in chest films .    2.279130928230848
further exploration of this patient revealed a left - sided superior vena cava .    2.441016058870969
definition of the problem : in 1997 , percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ( ptca ) was performed in 138 . 001 cases in germany .    2.407244246135798
the standard indications , single vessel disease and UNK controlled angina , are more and more extended to UNK disease with and without severe angina , unstable or UNK angina , and acute myocardial infarction ( ami ) itself .    2.269781040104479
UNK asymptomatic stenoses of more than 70 - 80 % is a widely used indication , intending prophylaxis of complete occlusion and ami .    2.3837660088973878
actually there is no generally accepted guideline for the different new indications , conservative versus invasive treatment schedule .    2.3672165580993116
it is difficult for the patient to get appropriate information before his decision between mechanical procedures and conservative methods ; authentic informed consent actually seems to be in a very bad position .    2.360085789929392
in 1992 the working group called " arbeitsgemeinschaft UNK UNK UNK ( UNK ) " decided to start a registry of all ptca procedures , in order to gain knowledge about the present status of ptca in germany .    2.516594319746931
up to march 1999 , UNK . 608 ptca are UNK .    2.450932079921063
two children developed multiple melanocytic naevi after polychemotherapy administered for acute lymphoblastic UNK in one and for non - hodgkin lymphoma in the other .    2.3692853925635173
many small randomized studies with < beta > - blockers in patients with chronic heart failure have been published in recent years .    2.702913360852586
a large meta - analysis by UNK combining 18 studies with UNK patients showed a 32 % reduction in mortality in patients treated with < beta > - blockers .    2.435850562367028
mortality and hospitalization together were reduced by 37 % .    2.503334155273148
in 1998 two large randomized trials investigating UNK ( UNK ii ) and metoprolol ( UNK - UNK ) were finished .    3.048669819119391
both studies show a significant reduction in mortality in patients treated with < beta > - blockers .    2.7075179390443047
the ongoing UNK study compares < beta > 1 - selective blockers like metoprolol with UNK < beta > - blockers like carvedilol in patients with chronic heart failure .    2.258143401109318
large clinical registries demonstrate clinical practicability of < beta > - blocker treatment of patients with chronic heart failure .    2.4641747519863872
all patients with UNK chronic heart failure ought to be treated with < beta > - blockers additional to a basic therapy with ace inhibitors , diuretics , and digitalis .    2.428323303439901
the < beta > - blocker therapy regimen is to start with low doses and to increase the dose carefully : " start low and go slow " .    2.0305347054792824
purpose : cardiac imaging includes determination of the size and structure of the cardiac chambers , valves , great vessels and the coronary arteries , chamber and valvular function , myocardial perfusion , viability and metabolism .    2.4417825719969897
a 52 - year - old patient presenting with severe thoracic pain of more than 30 minutes duration and st - segment elevation > 1 mv in leads v1 - 3 was given 100 mg rt - pa . with persisting thoracic pain and st - segment elevation , coronary angiography was performed 90 minutes after administration of thrombolytic therapy .    2.091114513332104
surprisingly , angiography revealed normal coronary arteries in presence of marked hypertrophic cardiomyopathy .    2.191830690001053
new onset of thoracic pain after four hours led to chest UNK demonstrating increased mediastinal widening and new pleural effusion as compared to a baseline chest film prior to rt - pa . spiral computed tomography revealed overt type b aortic dissection with an intimal flap and communication distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery with signs of a mediastinal hematoma .    2.210711839959048
immediate cardiac surgery with replacement of the dissected aortic segment was successfully performed .    2.4952087166665238
a literature review revealed 4 % of aortic dissection to present with electrocardiographic signs of acute myocardial infarction and 13 % to have concomitant coronary artery disease ; moreover 34 cases of aortic dissection were misdiagnosed as infarction and subjected to thrombolytic agents with a mortality of 64 % UNK the importance of exclusion of dissection prior to UNK therapy .    2.2973593290446996
between 1984 and 1996 we performed a mason gastroplasty for the treatment of morbid obesity : 14 patients ( average age 40 ( 26 - 48 ) years , body mass index ( bmi ) 48 ( 37 - 71 ) kg / m2 , excessive body weight 67 ( 41 - 116 ) kg ) .    2.1159459844354425
since the end of 1996 we now apply adjustable laparoscopic gastric banding ( lab band ) : 73 patients ( average age 39 ( 22 - 64 ) years , bmi 45 ( 32 - 69 ) kg / m2 , excessive body weight 66 ( 41 - 116 ) kg ) .    1.92219470068972
we compared the early and late results of both methods .    2.9453587712712404
early results : no relevant morbidity or mortality for neither method .    2.2322528530441033
late / intermediate results : reoperation rate for both methods 15 % .    2.300012307525299
after an average of 3 . 7 years the excessive body weight loss ( ewl ) for gastroplasty was 54 ( 22 - 96 ) % .    2.3187279826993903
the ewl after lab band for 24 patients after 12 months was 47 ( 11 - 127 ) % and for 8 patients after 18 months 51 ( 28 - 139 ) % .    1.9909823116050365
since the introduction of the UNK band the number of bariatric operations has greatly increased .    3.319019599725051
nevertheless , the perioperative complication rate has remained low , and the long - term outcome is similar for both methods .    2.8975710630057114
we investigated the relationships between prolactin ( prl ) levels and antibody occurrence in systemic lupus erythematosus ( sle ) .    1.9206568110423552
no significant association between prl levels and the majority of the autoantibodies studied ( anti - u1 UNK , anti - UNK , anti - UNK , anti - UNK , anti - UNK , auto - UNK , anti - UNK ) could be confirmed ( p > 0 . 05 ) , anti - ro / ssa antibodies being an exception .    2.7664334837812725
our results showed significantly increased frequencies of these antibodies in the group of female sle patients with normal prl levels ( < 20 µg / l ) : anti ro / ssa in 53 % ( p < 0 . UNK , 2 = 5 . 80 , rr = 4 . 0 ) and anti - ro / ssa + anti - ro / la in 60 % ( p < 0 . 05 , 2 = 4 . 05 ) compared with female sle patients with UNK .    2.4751095310271833
an UNK cyst of the heart is a rare cause of acute cardiac tamponade .    3.1543356135560576
we report on a 24 year old male from the UNK who was brought in an emergency state from a UNK hospital complaining of severe dyspnea , thoracic pain , dizziness , and a short period of unconsciousness .    2.3778110174966867
we report on the case of a 51 - year - old female patient who had been suffering from multiple itching nodules for 3 years .    2.566075692049551
some of these lesions were classified clinically and histologically as keratoacanthomas ( ka ) , whereas the multiple smaller nodules were found on histological examination to be either early stage ka or lesions of prurigo simplex UNK .    2.1842580178132707
in two ka , hpv subtype 2 was identified by in situ hybridization .    2.245362917582042
treatment with etretinate resulted in remission of the fully developed ka and reduced the occurrence of new ones .    2.401607731394442
the outbreak of multiple ka in our patient resembled a rare subtype described by UNK and UNK .    2.4624865321373295
UNK follow - up for 28 months to date has revealed that the ka arise from the subacute prurigo lesions .    2.517354847189679
this mode of prurigo - dependent ka development has not previously been reported .    2.147878214514298
we describe a rare case of a papillary fibroelastoma of the aortic valve occurring simultaneously with a cystic tumor ( a so - called mesothelioma ) of the atrioventricular nodal region .    2.73834509131677
at autopsy the tumor was found to prolapse into and UNK the right coronary UNK , leading to an acute , recurring myocardial infarction .    3.0493142051348214
histological examination of the grossly unremarkable conduction system of the heart revealed a cystic tumor in the region of the atrioventricular node .    3.0092906492715055
to our knowledge , this is the first report of coexistence of these two rare cardiac tumors .    2.2581523383989457
although still rare , pregnancy and delivery in women with spinal cord injuries is becoming more frequent ( table 2 ) .    2.312397073810882
in 85 % - 90 % of patients with lesions above UNK symptoms of autonomic hyperreflexia ( table 1 ) , especially paroxysmal and excessive increases in arterial blood pressure , may occur .    2.7870231893871757
in UNK a 31 - year - old UNK UNK with a complete transverse spinal lesion at t4 for an elective caesarean section , no indication of hypertonic cardiovascular dysregulation either intra - or postoperatively was observed after repeated epidural administration of bupivacaine .    2.2244315734192415
distinct intraoperative UNK of the abdominal wall muscles was , however , not influenced by the dosages selected .    3.6178013883710496
repetitive magnetic stimulation ( rtms ) is a non - invasive , painless method to induce transient activation in UNK regions of the human cortex .    2.666158877681277
in contrast to tms with single pulses rtms allows a more effective stimulation of association cortex and temporary interference with the proper functioning of stimulated areas .    1.9188495307829674
possible applications for examination of the functional anatomy of language lateralisation , memory functions and visual perception are discussed .    2.3642815001197497
possible therapeutic for movement disorders and depression are discussed .    2.3187814360161703
on the basis of theoretical considerations and current experience rtms induced epileptogenic effects are discussed and safety recommendations are given .    2.0852685684383667
an unusual shaped piece of skin was found in the oral cavity of a woman who had been UNK to death .    2.9845094859581396
physical examination of the victim ' s numerous male UNK revealed one to have an injury of the same shape on the ventral surface of the left ring finger .    2.8343260906272763
molecular biological investigations showed that this suspect and the piece of skin exhibited corresponding dna patterns ( frequency 1 : 700 000 ) .    1.974286345379549
this case underlines the importance of physical examination as a preliminary to further detailed investigation .    2.4191383803246373
nineteen men with post - prostatectomy urinary incontinence grade ii and iii ( mean follow - up 12 . 7 months ) underwent periurethral injections of collagen .    2.464123800377139
in all , 37 procedures were performed ; 58 % of the patients underwent the procedure at least twice .    2.715400329243815
a mean of 16 ml collagen was injected .    2.5989682634794424
the results were successful directly after injections , leaving all patients continent ; however , after 3 months the treatment failed and all patients returned to their incontinence status as seen preoperatively .    2.291040110770136
no perioperative complications were noted .    2.871508820003455
despite the simple and safe nature of this procedure , men with severe postoperative stress incontinence do not benefit from periurethral collagen injections .    2.2993619486963763
after a short review of the literature , some aspects of the psychodynamics and therapy of trichotillomania with an adolescent patient are presented that up to now have not been described in great detail .    2.9292096233624436
against the backdrop of previous fears of being abandoned , the patient UNK threatened that while coping with the developmental tasks of sexuality and aggressiveness she will be dropped once again .    2.0609634865596322
this psychodynamically oriented therapy makes it possible for the patient to accept and UNK the corresponding feelings in a relationship that gives a feeling of security .    2.429159632229463
therefore , the symptoms that previously served the purpose of regulating diffuse inner tensions and fears may be abandoned .    2.194797010423244
according to sonographic criteria , 55 patients underwent surgical treatment with mobilisation in a lower leg plaster or conservative treatment with early mobilisation in heel UNK ( 3 cm ) shoes when an acute achilles tendon rupture ( atr ) was diagnosed .    1.9875571960653684
the follow - up period in 51 patients was 2 . 4 years ( operated group = 28 patients , conservative group = 23 patients ) with clinical examination and testing of isokinetic muscle strength in knee joint flexion .    2.396506101208393
after surgical treatment , minor wound infections occurred in 10 . 6 % .    2.849651067446891
UNK occurred in 13 % of the conservative group .    3.548461032202464
following conservative treatment , the rate of stress - related UNK was significantly higher ( p = 0 . UNK ) .    3.1405565155337634
in the operated group mean isokinetic muscle strength was 13 . 7 % lower than in the UNK leg and decreased significantly with non - operative treatment to 75 . 3 % ( p = 0 . 012 ) .    3.1717993238706064
we recommend surgical treatment of acute atr .    3.421431051307396
the indications for conservative treatment depend on the extent of the rupture ( measured by ultrasound in the equinus position ) , the desired level of daily activity and the patient ' s degree of compliance .    2.791874271025305
" UNK " promises to become a reliable method for UNK the sex of our children .    3.021515603968212
as so many innovations in the field of assisted reproductive technology , however , sex selection raises difficult moral and legal issues .    2.4661167711069236
in this paper , we focus on the question whether or not sex selection calls for a legal ban .    2.4739147946529862
since it does not seem to imply any serious harm to others , we argue in favour of the UNK of sex selection .    2.6909288631766515
acute limb ischemia is an emergency which regularly requires operative treatment in departments of general surgery .    2.2715059477943527
in about 70 % of cases there is an embolic reason for acute ischemia .    3.1000570664860856
in the majority of cases urgent operative desobliteration is required to guarantee limb salvage .    2.3701977216669605
the introduction of balloon catheters reduced the surgical trauma significantly in cases of long secondary thromboses .    2.5924089369165584
more complex procedures are required in patients with preexisting chronic arterial occlusive disease .    2.8276967697265367
the mortality of these emergency operations is still 10 - 20 % with a limb salvage rate of 80 - 90 % .    2.4197492209272835
infectious complications related to acquired neutropenia have become a major medical issue , often requiring intensive care management .    2.2015412298958954
these infections may be lethal if empirical broad - spectrum treatment is not rapidly started at the first sign of infection ( i . e . , fever ) , and this concept is now widely recognized a standard practice .    2.3680524064428816
however , the choice of antibiotics has generated considerable controversy for nearly 25 years .    2.2715534250843157
after reviewing some particularities of infection in UNK patients , this paper will discuss the options and present comprehensive algorithm for non - infectious diseases specialist , including recent advances about early iv - oral switch and the selection of low risk patients for outpatient management .    2.1946497998852976
background : it has been suggested that inflammatory processes play a role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes ( acs ) .    2.569223075843646
c - reactive protein ( crp ) is a classic acute phase protein .    2.4944087438365425
it is yet unclear whether , in addition to established markers as troponin t ( tnt ) , determination of crp in patients admitted for acs contributes significantly to the diagnosis and prognosis of acs . patients and methods : we investigated 50 patients with acs ( 59 . 4 sd 13 . 9 years ) in the first hour after admission and 4 - 24h later with respect to tnt ( UNK , UNK diagnostics ) and crp ( UNK , modified UNK crp plus , analytical sensitivity 0 . UNK / dl ) .    2.5998330385261723
fifty percent of the patients were classified as having unstable angina retrospectively .    3.384529940868283
all patients were followed in the 6 weeks post discharge regarding death and recurrent acs . results : the cumulative event rate at 6 weeks after discharge was 62 . 5 % for patients being crp and tnt positive compared to 35 . 3 % in tnt positive and crp negative patients .    2.3341830293254127
in tnt negative patients a positive crp test predicted 33 . 3 % of events and 28 . 8 % of patients negative for crp and tnt had events at 42 days post discharge .    2.451330413680644
logistic regression analysis regarding the primary endpoint including tnt and crp ( 4 - 24h values ) , age , gender and diagnosis resulted in independent prediction of acs or death by tnt ( cutoff 0 . UNK / l , p = 0 . UNK , odds ratio = 7 . 5 ) and crp ( cutoff 0 . UNK / dl , p = 0 . UNK , odds ratio = 5 . 3 ) .    2.445039193936379
sensitivity / specificity for ami diagnosis were 69 . 6 % / 75 % for tnt and 12 % / 72 % for crp in the first hour and 91 . 3 % / 68 . 2 % for tnt and 68 % / 72 % for crp 4 - 24h later . conclusions : besides tnt , high sensitivity crp determination has no additional value for early ami diagnosis .    2.169214449901149
the prognosis of these patients during the first 24 hours is significantly and independently predicted by crp measurements in addition to troponin t .    2.906524160551031
purpose : evaluation of clinical and morphological results in 44 consecutive patients with 45 aneurysms of the posterior circulation .    2.737354033678508
following coronary artery bypass grafting repeat ischemia mandatory for reintervention occurs in 2 to 30 % of cases , depending mainly on graft age .    2.5293580678254544
selection of a suitable strategy for revascularisation - transcatheter angioplasty or reoperation - depends on various parameters including coronary morphology , left ventricular performance , comorbidity and availability of graft material .    1.9881447044319391
UNK interventions on saphenous vein bypass grafts are feasible , but lower primary success rates and a higher incidence of restenosis - compared with native coronary arteries - have to be expected .    2.2287452251221964
repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations are associated with a significantly higher perioperative morbidity and mortality , patency rates are lower and late clinical outcome is worse than in primary surgery .    2.5346736809358457
we report on a patient who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting 4 years ago revealing a high grade ostial stenosis in a UNK - graft supplying UNK , lad and UNK sequentially , making reintervention necessary .    2.171009545831177
intravascular - ultrasound guided directional coronary atherectomy was performed with good primary and long - term result .    2.6203395578181934
our case demonstrates that , if all relevant clinical parameters and different therapeutic options are taken into account , complex transcatheter angioplasty procedures are feasible and associated with a reasonable amount of risk , thus avoiding repeat coronary artery bypass graft operations .    2.2561716946591495
in recent years the indication for a mastectomy for breast cancer has been increasingly restricted .    2.6489037044013215
the use of plastic reconstructive techniques enhances the rate of breast - conserving therapy even for large breast tumors with excellent cosmetic results and oncological safety .    2.310413653901351
the breast - to - tumor ratio and locally complete resection with free tumor margins of 1 - 2 cm are the most important factors in breast - conserving surgery .    2.680231542070261
different techniques of reduction mammoplasty within the concept of oncological breast surgery not only allow large tumors in large breasts to be resected , but also relatively large tumors in normal sized or even smaller breasts to be resected .    2.1951121353715726
other advantages are the reduction of breast size and therefore target volume before postoperative radiation procedures as well as in cancer prophylaxis and risk reduction by reducing ipsi - and contralateral breast tissue .    2.2788652022403095
reduction mammoplasty techniques with different resection areas have to be selected for individual tumor locations .    2.5784107035011683
the best symmetry is achieved by bilateral mammoplasty in a one step procedure with lumpectomy and axillary dissection .    2.0895237303447063
oncoplastic or reconstructive surgery in the target breast is often followed by procedures to improve symmetry by contralateral reduction .    2.31053318889683
whenever possible , mammoplasty techniques with minimal scarring should be chosen out of a variety of reduction procedures .    2.447357643838636
epidermoid cysts are rare , benign tumors of the testis or , less frequently , the inguinal cord .    2.8651859782618962
generally , they affect males between 10 and 39 years .    2.296352206460469
we report on a newborn with an epidermoid cyst of the right testis that had been diagnosed in utero and was removed with preservation of the testicle .    2.3946366498562495
although there are various published descriptions of the dura mater spinalis [ 4 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 16 ] , some points relating to the texture of the collagen fibres in the dura have still not been adequately explained .    2.071246282088265
in this study the orientation of the collagen UNK bundles was revealed with the aid of scanning electron microscopy , and our observations have yielded new insights into the three - dimensional structure of the human dura mater spinalis .    2.435333356884345
reconstructive plastic surgery is not always possible or advisable for nasal defects following tumor resections .    2.3752291561095285
facial prostheses offer an alternative therapy .    2.697530354754814
since 1991 , 37 patients with nasal defects after tumor surgery were treated in the berlin center of facial prostheses : 28 received " soft " silicone facial prostheses and 9 " solid " UNK facial prostheses .    2.0657680696134846
in 35 patients protheses were bone - anchored : brånemark implants were used in 12 patients and an epitec frame construction in 23 patients .    2.240855388296775
glue - on prostheses were applied to only two patients .    2.535585987034423
no intraoperative complications occurred at implant insertion .    2.484905106869933
the implant success rate was 78 % for the brånemark implants ( 89 . 7 % in non - radiated areas and 50 % in radiated areas ) and 100 % in radiated and non - radiated areas for the epitec system .    2.607053820094638
our investigation shows that given the right indication , the bone - anchored facial prosthesis is safe , cosmetically acceptable , uncomplicated and not stressful for the patient .    2.0955560104726603
we report a patient who developed malignant transformation of a cellular blue nevus .    2.320693422981746
at the age of 19 years the congenital , pigmented tumor on the left buttock was histopathologically diagnosed as cellular blue nevus .    2.2605459098561806
thirty years later the tumor dramatically increased in size , involving the entire left buttock within several months .    2.194083329074529
multiple biopsies revealed the presence of a cellular blue nevus within the papillary dermis and an invasive , pleomorphic pigmented sarcoma in the depth of the tissue spreading into subcutis and skeletal muscle .    2.2240040287171836
both benign and malignant cells were UNK + , vimentin + and hmb - 45 + , but only the malignant tumor cells stained positive for the proliferating cell nuclear antigen .    2.234017526344675
general examination disclosed multiple metastases in the paraaortal lymph nodes and the retroperitoneum as well as a single brain metastasis .    2.5914567670601603
despite palliative therapy with ionizing radiation and chemotherapy , the patient developed generalized metastases and died within weeks .    2.550730766251401
this case clearly confirms that cellular blue nevi have the potential for malignant transformation and that the malignant variant may UNK UNK just as a malignant melanoma .    2.30941993466068
( UNK alert ) hypnosis and sports in the psychotherapy of out - patients with anxiety disorders .    2.083958822222623
a process - oriented approach combining UNK with cognitive - behavioral concepts within a systemic model of psychotherapy for the outpatient treatment of anxiety disorders is outlined .    2.0788454895323993
the use of active alert hypnosis ( hypnosis by bicycle ergometry ) combining elements of hypnotherapy and sports therapy is adapted to patients characteristics and the process of therapy .    2.076365203666881
relaxation and active alert hypnosis and different sports are used as methods of UNK exposure respectively training of competence .    2.2523842284943303
the treatment is sequentially structured ( motivation , symptom - control , conflict , integration ) .    2.0314858866409478
active alert hypnosis UNK the therapeutic process within the stage of symptom - control ( reduction of anxiety and depression ) and of conflict ( UNK of intrapsychic UNK or traumata within UNK induced by physical exercises ) .    2.3175643905123353
therapeutic goals and techniques for each stage are specified by case examples .    2.1540575732256104
endoscopic techniques in the spine have become possible with improvements in instrumentation .    2.5700601554913405
other minimally invasive techniques are limited to intradiscal surgery , not at the site of the pathology .    2.635596621385958
with the transforaminal approach , treatment in the epidural space has become possible .    2.636720778406043
in a pilot study we investigated the pitfalls , risks , and complications of transforaminal surgery .    2.7093383309563004
patient satisfaction and acceptance of the method were documented .    3.130100559073767
some 27 patients with disk pathologies at the level of the disk space , excluding extremely medially situated herniations , were treated .    2.2600320002060243
we used a standard posterolateral approach under local anesthesia combined with spinal morphine anesthesia .    2.151038969965596
the treated levels were l5 / s1 ( 11 ) , l4 / 5 ( 12 ) , l3 / 4 ( 3 ) , and l2 / 3 ( 1 ) .    2.5465230963393357
all areas could be reached by this approach .    2.5422890179824438
one procedure had to be abandoned because of instrumentation problems .    2.674437188214212
one patient had recurrent disk herniation and had an open procedure .    2.298407291918938
two patients were reoperated because of persistent pain .    2.6717224663835215
no signs of UNK could be found in these cases , but there was swelling of the nerve root and minimal scarring .    3.426057751431365
minor complications were UNK root paresthesia and headache postoperatively .    2.2890981145454394
this impression was supported in the open revisions we performed .    2.3879975594426797
clinical acceptance of the procedure was excellent and the patients recovered very quickly .    2.9289585258969453
endoscopic transforaminal surgery has a considerable learning curve , even when surgeons are UNK with the posterolateral approach and UNK surgery .    2.578524131755283
however , it offers a good alternative to other minimally invasive procedures and has to be seen as a good alternative to open disk surgery , too .    2.680812728660411
for that purpose it is necessary to request feedback informations about kind and severity of the emergency situation from the emergency medical team working at the scene .    2.4437836477886306
the case of a fatal catheter - induced cardiac tamponade in a 81 - year - old woman is reported .    2.3210538301548356
death occurred after a delay of 18 h following placement of a central venous catheter for parenteral feeding .    2.29681629600033
according to the clinical and histological findings , placement of the catheter caused a primary perforation .    2.962043606015196
confirmation of proper placement of the catheter tip was not performed .    2.522014973183982
despite clinical indications on the forthcoming complication , sufficient emergency treatment was not carried out .    2.120466417698338
background : the rapid integration of new technology into ophthalmologic practice , e . g . lasik ( laser in situ keratomileusis ) , is associated with new complications .    2.2689946311296216
the limitations of the new technology cannot be precisely determined .    2.678254657380702
during lamellar cuts with UNK intraocular pressure ( iop ) elevations occur .    2.074448464519977
the iop elevation during the lamellar cut cannot be determined by conventional tonometry .    2.261256211971828
due to its superior soft tissue contrast conventional mri is the imaging method of choice in the evaluation of ankle joint disorders .    2.45320672715632
conventional mr imaging can accurately demonstrate normal or acutely injured ligaments ; however , in subacute and chronic injury joint fluid necessary for delineation of injured ligaments is absent and mr arthrography should be performed .    2.0528018253794005
mr arthrography uses the intraarticular injection of contrast material to UNK the joint , yielding improved discrimination of intraarticular structures .    2.6409845047014295
this joint distension with mr arthrography is also helpful in the staging of osteochondritis dissecans , since in cases of unstable lesions tracking of contrast material into the interface can be more easily demonstrated .    2.2923178929964783
finally , high contrast and joint distension by mr arthrography improves the detection of intraarticular loose bodies , which often require surgery .    2.3044165131578933
mr arthrography , although invasive , may provide additional information in various ankle joint disorders .    2.3142435705895155
several studies have demonstrated an association chlamydia pneumoniae with coronary artery disease , suggesting that infection with c . pneumoniae increases the risk for coronary artery disease by factor 2 or more .    2.484479974964287
since atherosclerosis is considered to be a chronic inflammatory process , these data would fit into the response - to - injury hypothesis of atherosclerosis rather than representing a completely novel concept .    2.419163461540986
several pathomechanisms as increased cytokine synthesis , proliferative and UNK effects could transmit the effects of chronic c . pneumoniae infection .    2.335375000263724
animal models and first clinical trials using antibiotic therapy seem to support an etiological role of c . pneumoniae in coronary artery disease .    2.162080960644268
in this paper the current knowledge of the role of c - pneumoniae in coronary artery disease is reviewed and possible pathomechanisms are discussed .    2.7540881843065423
preeclampsia is a disorder specific to pregnancy which can affect all maternal organs .    2.252478795481594
cerebral involvement with the occurence of convulsions is the defining factor for eclampsia .    2.171437461922759
the most prominent signs of cerebral dysfunction include headache , hyperreflexia , visual disturbances , confusion and / or altered state of consciousness .    2.1971226843458065
intracerebral and subarachnoidal hemorrhage are severe however rare complications of eclampsia .    2.2297677869959345
tcd investigations regularly find vasospasm in all great cerebral arteries .    2.19265115622971
reversible hypodense lesions in the white matter on early ct - scans and increased signal intensities on t2 - weighted mrt images indicate local edema .    2.078916980461221
the etiology of preeclampsia and eclampsia remains unknown and its current pathophysiology is still hypothetical .    2.1669166389118244
the clinical picture may best be explained by an endothelial dysfunction with increased vascular UNK to circulating pressure agents as well as by a structural endothelial lesion with fluid loss from the intravascular compartment .    2.155700721460662
this article reviews the surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability .    2.704716546571658
the treatment rationale includes exact definition of the instability pattern ( " envelope - of - motion " of the tibia ) by clinical examination , UNK and stress radiography .    2.828140493920292
exact evaluation of the osseous anatomy is mandatory to identify an UNK varus UNK .    2.6667975545546017
this osseous variant in combination with posterior / posterolateral instability should be treated by an osteotomy in every case .    2.70738210320006
the technique of additive osteotomy to correct varus and increase the sagittal tilt of the proximal tibia is described .    2.265989312980124
ligament reconstruction in chronic posterior knee instability must address the posterior cruciate ligament and the lateral / posterolateral structures in many cases .    2.423100676172413
patellar tendon grafts , quadriceps tendon grafts or hamstrings can be used for posterior cruciate ligament replacement .    2.72666982583527
arthroscopic or mini - open techniques may be used for graft placement , direct posterior fixation of the graft via a posterior incision is an option for patellar tendon grafts .    2.4278467258100975
UNK ' s biceps plasty or UNK ' s biceps tenodesis may be used for posterolateral stabilization ; a biceps tendon UNK can also be used for lateral collateral ligament reconstruction .    2.6352114778825872
results of surgery are still moderate .    2.6677365804067446
in the author ' s series of chronic posterior / posterolateral instability , 26 cases were treated with posterior cruciate ligament reconstruction and biceps tenodesis .    2.564977894788612
follow - up at 18 months demonstrated increased stability ( mean residual posterior drawer 8 mm at 70 ° and 20 UNK force ) and improved knee function ( 33 % ikdc b , 67 % ikdc c ) .    1.9015491646276315
presently , surgical treatment of chronic posterior knee instability should be restricted to centers UNK to this problem .    2.817762299643548
this article reviews the current state of consensus reached for the diagnosis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy on the basis of conventional histopathological and immunohistochemical methods for inflammatory infiltrates in addition to molecular biological methods for persistence of viral genome in UNK biopsies .    2.3068336291984903
health policy in germany has in recent years given priority to the self - administration of physicians , sickness funds , and hospital associations .    2.2995910266593684
hence , legal regulations on quality assurance have focused on defining responsibilities and areas of primary importance , while precise processes are being defined by the self - administration .    2.033984703167782
to support the implementation of quality assurance in the health care system , the german federal ministry of health has funded model - projects , e . g . , to support the adaptation of successful strategies of total quality management for health care .    2.5715865701581593
the research field of tissue engineering combines cells biology , biomaterial science , and surgery .    2.2045346220672797
major long - term goals are tissue and organ replacement therapies using the patients ' own cells .    2.7423880184998013
our work is focused on the treatment of severe joint defects and on plastic surgery using in vitro engineered cartilage tissues .    2.4811423819895215
the practical approaches in cartilage engineering face problems with three - dimensional cell distribution or cell immobilization raising biocompatibility problems .    2.0958076499912788
the tissue engineering of cartilage is based on combining biocompatible cell embedding substances such as fibrin , UNK , UNK , hyaluronic acid and fiber fleece scaffolds of poly - hydroxy acids ( UNK / UNK ) .    2.2854194607197225
different technical approaches were established : a ) three - dimensional in vitro cultures of chondrocytes for the development of vital tissue transplants and b ) interacting three - dimensional cultures consisting of different cell populations , such as bmp - transfected mesenchymal cells .    2.4201290788173444
the UNK artificial tissue constructs were cultured in perfusion chambers to maintain a stable diffusion of nutrients during the in vitro pre - formation step .    2.0106322377464965
transplants were found to produce cartilage UNK morphological patterns and matrix .    2.551835669227567
80 % of the transplants remained stable in vivo .    2.8288327677077314
however , 20 % of the tissues are resorbed or replaced by a fibrous tissue .    2.7478029499940173
these results demonstrate that current artificial cartilage transplants are already feasible for plastic reconstruction .    2.1461833472134284
the treatment of severe joint defects , however , faces additional problems which are addressed in ongoing studies : ( a ) the fixation of engineered cartilage in joints , ( b ) the protection against chronic inflammatory degradation , and ( c ) the required enormous mechanical stability .    2.418234628452343
we report on a rare complication , fracture and cardiac embolization of a silicone - rubber catheter and its interventional retrieval .    1.9947555610858805
the aro multicenter study intended to show clinical and radiological differences with regard to different systems of fixation and designs of the prothesis in total hip replacement in patients with hip dysplasia , osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis .    2.525587189014343
in 1987 and 1988 UNK total hip prothesis were implanted by the 24 hospitals which took part in the study .    2.2051882721781406
UNK prothesis ( 95 , 6 % ) were clinically and radiologically examined .    3.041723775154187
the follow - up period averaged 6 . 9 years .    2.955340571120762
the results of the aro multicenter - study showed that despite difficult preoperative conditions especially in cases of rheumatoid arthritis the satisfaction rate improved remarkably .    2.2756302142624123
regarding the rate of infection after operation there were no differences between the 3 groups .    3.3547364028480637
only the rate of postoperative luxation concerning rheumatoid patients turned out to be twice the number of the others .    2.7053405909891746
in our opinion this is due to the fact that these rheumatics were operated by posterior approach .    2.596655869880553
patients with rheumatoid arthritis were satisfied most with their surgeries .    2.3696583273630214
results of rheumatic patients according to harris hip score were slightly worse than the results of the two other groups .    2.725947431625392
this was due to systemic involvement and bad preoperative function of the hip .    2.937516673002514
as a result of the study there were no differences in using cemented or cementless techniques for rheumatic hip replacement .    2.5069645233745153
the decision for the method of fixation should depend on the patient ' s ability to relief the prothesis after operation .    2.685872887361663
the study has shown that cementless implantation can also be used for young rheumatics provided that a suitable design of prothesis will be selected .    2.281788133420143
sepsis developing on the basis of a postoperative infection is a rare , but life - threatening event .    3.032219294482765
early diagnosis of postoperative complications usually facilitates decisive intervention and a favorable prognosis .    2.31186885411842
if the right moment is missed , endothelial damage leads to the release of inflammatory mediators and generalized systemic infection ( sirs ) .    2.1737633400098586
the collapse of the immune system results in immune paralysis and explains the inability of the organism to defend itself against systemic infections .    2.089102163956097
for early recognition of the developing septic complication and its effective treatment , pathophysiological and clinical issues are discussed .    2.199400475312238
the comparison of prediction of mortality and sepsis by different score systems was the objective of this retrospective study in 51 patients .    2.4182497012866637
on days 1 and 3 the true - positive ratio ( sensitivity ) was UNK against false - positive ratio ( 1 - specifity ) for each score .    2.3793602810121834
the area under the curve ( max .    2.446564932192106
0 . 5 ) correlates with the quality of the score system .    3.7739719481403387
we also tested the discrimination of septic and UNK patients by using the different scores .    2.606258026861732
bilateral symmetric changes in the cerebral hemispheric white matter are found with increasing frequency using ct and mri techniques .    2.635187512665742
these unspecific UNK of the white matter signal are often called leukoaraiosis .    2.996757885354758
they differ from the normal white matter signal .    2.457247307231737
these changes are found with increasing frequency in persons older than 60 years and also patients with dementia and cerebrovascular diseases .    2.2512778914252913
the pathogenesis , clinical significance and morphological substrate are unclear .    2.3645924862501992
the aim of this review is to summarise the actual knowledge about the etiology and clinical signs and symptoms found in patients with leukoaraiosis .    2.981212802714602
this term should not be used when white matter changes are found in patients younger than 35 years , with an unilateral onset , asymmetric distribution , and extensive changes all over the infra - and supratentorial white matter area .    2.2176961845149306
neuroradiological and clinical criteria are given to differentiate between leukoaraiosis and diseases of the white matter , especially enlarged virchow - robin spaces , UNK infarction , subcortical arteriosclerotic angiopathy ( UNK ' s disease ) , UNK of different origin , and demyelinating diseases .    2.5304031817710424
a case with various skeletal abnormalities , soft tissue masses and skin lesions diagnosed as proteus syndrome is reported .    2.149655486975724
proteus syndrome is included in the differential diagnosis of many disorders , because of the UNK nature of its clinical manifestations .    3.2198742789366546
it is a rare disorder and leads to functional disabilities as well as cosmetic and psychological problems .    3.1623486981288504
early diagnosis and careful follow - up with appropriate surgical interventions is important in preventing long - term complications .    2.9775087720668494
the value of elective pta in stenoses of the supraaortic vessels and especially of the carotid artery is still under discussion .    2.545301764518377
profiles of fundamental frequency sound pressure levels and voice duration are measured separately in clinical practice .    2.3064615756232545
it was the aim of the present study to combine the two examinations , in order to estimate the relationship between UNK , sound pressure level and voice duration and to develop a new computer - assisted UNK .    2.704091661242855
a three - dimensional ( 3d ) UNK phonogram was constructed based on spl profiles to obtain a general view of the parameters recorded .    2.3651988630205922
we have termed this " UNK " .    2.655736019029772
variable further projections were selected for the analysis of different aspects of UNK relationships .    2.57532403684386
the results in 21 healthy volunteers and 4 patients with UNK UNK demonstrated that there were three typical figures of the 3d UNK produced , depending on the relationship between voice duration when soft ( " piano " ) compared to loud ( " forte " ) .    2.348437933861026
in one - third of the healthy volunteers , the values of the piano voice duration were greater than those of forte for almost all UNK examined .    2.411470787930391
in two - thirds of the healthy subjects the values of forte voice duration were partly greater , as were those of piano voice duration .    2.152978798942803
all of the patients showed voice duration values greater for forte than for piano .    2.572064060024859
the results of the study demonstrate that the 3d phonogram is a useful tool for obtaining new insights into various relationships of voice parameters .    2.3860415394525902
sinus histiocytosis is as a rule a benign disease of lymph nodes , infiltrated by large histiocytes .    2.5022857531031146
these cells show typical UNK , particularly UNK .    2.7548563971086213
other organs may be also involved by this disease , often including the skin .    2.275004029624608
exclusive cutaneous sinus histiocytosis without infiltration of lymph nodes seems to be very rare .    2.9440259334758947
to exclude other non - x histiocytoses or histiocytosis - x , it is advisable to use immunohistochemistry .    2.5240645011015084
we report on a patient with sinus histiocytosis and discuss the problems of differential diagnosis .    2.4767649232923166
the case of a five - year - old girl with intractable UNK UNK and recurrent perianal fistulas is reported .    2.7524454729550647
extensive radiological investigation revealed the cyst and the associated fistulas extending into the perianal region and the vagina .    2.235666118894408
after verification of the anatomical situation , an uneventful surgical procedure was carried out .    2.7745074683815445
positron emission tomography ( pet ) is a noninvasive functional method for the study of solid tumor perfusion , metabolism and interaction with different therapeutic agents .    2.580325409335154
the aim of the study was the investigation of the metabolism of hepatocellular carcinomas ( hcc ) and the kinetics during a treatment with intratumoral ethanol by pet .    2.3692294686396838
the ongoing study includes seven patients with child a cirrhosis and hcc ( uicc stage iii - iva ; tumor size 3 - 6 cm ) .    2.2135269387611527
dynamic pet studies ( 60 min ) with 18f - fluordeoxyglucose ( fdg ) were performed prior to therapy to assess tumor viability .    2.1019701262372927
the evaluation of the fdg data demonstrated a liver - equivalent uptake in six of the tumors ( well and moderately differentiated hcc ) , which were poorly delineated against the normal liver parenchyma .    2.3805778806656783
one moderately differentiated hcc showed an increased fdg metabolism , indicating no correlation between histology and metabolism .    2.288206478982303
a dose of 37 - 80 UNK 11c - ethanol was applied together with a UNK therapeutic dose of the drug via a puncture needle positioned under sonography .    2.465079590318263
five out of seven tumors demonstrated a high 11c uptake shortly after the end of the ethanol injection followed by constant 11c - ethanol concentration during the whole study period of 45 min .    2.1396913093234717
the pet data demonstrated no significant elimination of the 11c - ethanol from the tumor and no accumulation in the surrounding liver tissue .    2.361528469164638
one case showed a decrease of the intratumoral 11c - ethanol concentration due to a UNK of a tumor vein , and in another case the surrounding liver parenchyma demonstrated significant 11c uptake in the early phase following UNK injection of the drug .    2.89401130658487
in conclusion , pet is a useful tool for the study of the mechanism and the kinetics of percutaneous intratumoral ethanol injection of hcc .    2.423203214705755
however , the increasing knowledge , instead of clarification , leads us to realize that these terms may assemble a wide variety of lung pathologies .    1.9483575550043748
indeed , many circumstances can result in these syndromes and no particular factor has been defined to distinguish ards of one etiology from another .    2.1222371652949534
we are still UNK about which factors lead to the extended inflammation from pneumonia to ards , while it is not clear whether the timing of events are determined by some mediators .    2.277942371207918
furthermore , in the clinical arena , there is no clear distinction between pneumonia , severe pneumonia which may lead to ali and then ards .    2.8526693919964248
finally , the results of all these studies should have allowed us to investigate new therapeutical approaches while none seems to emerge .    2.40867188311483
this review is an analysis by an icu clinician of the different points of view of these syndromes and intends to give a global vision of the numerous factors UNK , emphasizing the complex interactions between them .    2.1420181274656356
the present state about new potential treatments directed on mediators is summarized .    2.1020303254995976
the aim of the study was to evaluate if a combined physiologic - therapeutic scoring system ( maris = UNK intensive score ) offers better outcome prediction compared to scoring systems , which are based either only physiologically ( apache ii = acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii ) or only therapeutically ( tiss = therapeutic intervention scoring system ) in medical intensive care medicine .    1.9050922695112877
main outcome parameters employed were hospital mortality , severity of disease classification and length of hospital stay .    2.3238154902924646
during a 12 - months period ( 1993 / 94 ) , 531 consecutive patients ( icu stay > 4 hours ) being admitted to a medical icu of a tertiary care university hospital were prospectively investigated .    2.0759525542739303
the day - 1 - scores of maris , apache ii , and tiss were determined and the patients were followed until hospital discharge or death .    2.577087960564625
there was no advantage in using the combined scoring system ( maris ) neither in discrimination between survival and non - survival ( hospital mortality ; areas under the roc - curve : maris = 0 . 84 , apache ii = 0 . 86 , tiss = 0 . 78 ) nor in severity classification ( relationship between day - 1 - scores and hospital mortality : p < 0 . 001 ( chi2 - test ) in all three systems ) .    2.2288488123182395
in contrast only for the combined system ( maris ) , a dependence of length of hospital stay from day - 1 - scores in the analysis of survivors only and in the analysis of all patients ( survivors and non - survivors ) ( p < 0 . 001 ; anova ) could be demonstrated .    2.7830807947005805
in conclusion the combined physiologic - therapeutic scoring system ( maris ) did not offer a better outcome prediction concerning hospital mortality and severity classification compared to the established systems in critically ill patients .    2.1062682284309124
its use may be advantageous in evaluating the relationship between day - 1 - scores and length of hospital stay , which for economical reasons has become a parameter of growing interest in intensive care medicine .    2.317623698700977
a 23 month old boy was admitted to hospital because of anemia , mainly UNK rash and unclear pain .    2.2060015081937445
previously he had shown fever , conjunctivitis and UNK of hands and feet .    2.5978202174435627
laboratory findings were moderate leucocytosis , thrombocytosis , anemia , and an elevation of esr and gamma - globulins .    2.2866629431126597
no bacterial infection was found .    2.74273669277572
the ecg showed signs of a myocardial ischemia .    3.059912907960222
the sonography of the heart detected an aneurysm of the left coronary artery .    3.3805535930078863
the boy died of a sudden cardiac arrest .    2.658180223718887
the autopsy verified the diagnosis of UNK - syndrome and revealed two coronary aneurysms blocked by thrombosis and a necrotic panarteriitis .    2.7208428728481184
the etiology of the painful hip in children is widespread .    2.48734780076665
in this paper , UNK cases without previous trauma are discussed in detail .    2.4509167455568015
depending on age , history , clinical picture and laboratory results , an imaging diagnostic algorithm is presented , which should avoid unnecessary tests and lead to the necessary therapeutic measure .    2.3700263470085803
several common as well as uncommon clinical entities are illustrated by representative examples .    2.7430800027331625
the present study UNK the method of quantitative reverse UNK - polymerase chain reaction ( crt - pcr ) by quantifying , in bovine tissues , the specific mrnas for the two key proteins which regulate cellular cholesterol metabolism , the low density lipoprotein ( ldl ) - receptor and the 3 - hydroxy - 3 - UNK - UNK a ( hmg - coa ) reductase .    2.1911648123700616
our data reveal a broad range of expression for both mrnas .    2.2918099570848645
the ldl - receptor mrna expression was highest in the adrenal gland ( 6 . 7 x 104 molecules / ug cellular rna ) followed by the corpus UNK of the ovary , intermediate in the liver ( 8 . 6 x 102 molecules / ug cellular rna ) and not detectable in the large intestine .    2.2643757431556004
expression of the hmg - coa reductase almost paralleled ldl - receptor values .    2.300109408969522
it was found to be highest in the ovary ( 6 . 1 x 106 molecules / ug cellular rna ) followed by the adrenal gland , intermediate in the liver ( 3 . 1 x 105 molecules / ug cellular rna ) and lowest in the large intestine ( 9 . 9 x 104 molecules / ug cellular rna ) .    2.1802113028386496
these data are consistent with other reports concerning the quantitative analysis of the expression of both proteins as determined by other experimental approaches .    2.453722222386043
spinal opioids are effective analgesics for surgical and non - surgical pain .    2.601334929781087
central and systemic side effects are less frequent than with epidural local anaesthetics or parenteral opioids .    2.5683020745534244
this review focuses on the analgesic efficacy of spinal opioids and their combination with local anaesthetics for postoperative analgesia , including patient - controlled epidural analgesia .    2.3096001476159493
intrathecal administration of opioids has some advantages over their administration by the epidural route .    2.3061125988378195
several factors may influence selection of the opioid ; however , in most situations morphine is the drug of choice .    2.7260607303350888
thoracic epidural administration of opioids seems to have no clinically important advantages over the lumbar route in terms of quality of analgesia , adverse effects , doses required or pulmonary function .    2.5237021455001587
however , evidence suggesting that effective postoperative analgesia can significantly improve postoperative morbidity in patients at risk is UNK .    2.2983660674005866
in such patients , combined use of epidural local anaesthetics and opioids may become the technique of choice for postoperative analgesia .    2.6242775204684876
however , there is no evidence that this would have any clinically relevant benefit in low - risk patients .    2.4880906116616845
this contribution summarizes a discussion of several experts on the field of clinical nutrition , which was held in UNK UNK UNK , germany , may 20 - 21 , 1998 .    2.88118586631403
nutrition can be considered a medical treatment , which justifies assessment of benefits according to outcome parameters .    2.565305762238876
with regard to nutritional support of the cancer patient , evaluation of quality of life ( ql ) is more appropriate than morbidity and survival related parameters .    2.440641914255082
quality of life is a multidimensional construct which can be measured by standardized questionnaires .    2.747497120708943
the ql questionnaire ( qlq - c30 ) of the european organization for research and treatment of cancer ( eortc ) , is an established and validated instrument which provides reliable information with regard to disease - related limitations of ql .    2.589905486145112
the measurement of ql can be extended by appropriate modules for specific problems according to the underlying cancer disease and special therapies ( e . g . , percutaneous endoscopic UNK ) .    2.2354348704451636
in the individual case , the interpretation of the role of nutritional parameters for ql may be UNK by other parameters , such as disease or personal changes .    3.003627824024063
however , the information supports decision making about the indication , the route of nutritional therapy , as well as individual follow - up .    2.5726457083506853
using ql as an outcome parameter , carefully designed prospective trials might be feasible in order to investigate the outcome of nutritional therapy in patients with advanced cancer .    2.886608689564248
the inclusion of a control group is questionable from the ethical viewpoint .    2.6321114411935542
the treatment of distal fractures of the lower arm can be conservative or operative .    3.1484149326535227
the immediate aims of any treatment are anatomical realignment and the avoidance of trophic impairments , with the ultimate objective of unrestricted function of the hand and wrist .    2.3505048440591696
a graduated treatment scheme based on the asif classification is necessary to do justice to the different forms of fracture that can occur .    2.8604443430956805
the majority of injuries can still be successfully treated by conservative means ; operative treatment becomes more important when there are signs of unusually high levels of instability or joint involvement .    2.2348651708465592
the authors ' own patient population is presented in this paper : in these patients fixation with kirschner wires has proved to be the most successful of the operative procedures used , followed by palmar plate fixation with or without cancellous bone plasty , and for c - type fractures according to the asif classification or when there is severe soft - tissue damage , application of a fixateur UNK UNK the joint has proved best .    2.709124007627263
treatment strategy , risks , complications and results are presented .    2.880015626614326
in the heidelberg project of involuntary childlessness in men , andrological patients were surveyed from the time before diagnosis till the end of 1 year ' s andrological treatment .    2.15055228766554
cardiac complications remain an important cause of perioperative morbidity and mortality with noncardiac surgery , despite improvement in surgical techniques and anaesthetic management .    2.401358444228752
therefore preoperative cardiovascular risk assessment plays a pivotal role in management of patients prior to noncardiac surgery .    2.18534206053231
thorough history - taking and careful examination are essential to consider further diagnostic steps in order to predict the patient ' s individual perioperative cardiac risk as accurately as possible .    2.545980490353911
besides UNK of medical therapy , cardiac UNK and even balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery must be considered if indicated by preoperative cardiac testing .    2.3307871343287703
the etiology of the instability are ligamentous damage and functional neuromuscular disorder of the peroneal muscles .    2.413328241322907
the standards of diagnostics are the history with the frequency of inversion trauma per period and the interval from the primary trauma , the clinical examination and radiological stress tests .    2.678001856670534
newer diagnostic methods , up to now not well established in clinical routine , include UNK , UNK - measurements of the pronator muscles , the evaluation of peroneal reaction time on a tilting platform and dynamic UNK .    2.7790742979401055
conservative management of chronic ankle instability consists of wearing ankle UNK and rehabilitation programs concerned with peroneal muscle strengthening and coordination training .    1.9928111669887485
the indication for surgical reconstruction of the ankle ligaments are a well - documented mechanical instability with the neuromuscular reflexes intact and a failed physiotherapeutic training program .    2.451280655889288
the surgical procedure should be selected according to a priority list : 1 . anatomical repair , eventually augmented with periosteum from the fibula , 2 .    2.3606412209210563
UNK - jones tenodesis , and 3 .    2.9850434638702894
UNK - UNK tenodesis to treat a concomittant subtalar instability .    2.588743898629502
no other disease has exhibited such a significant influence on the behaviour of health care workers ( hcw ) as the aids pandemic .    2.3501108207225223
numerous epidemiological data , however , have proven that the overall risk of transmission of the human deficiency virus ( hiv ) during surgical interventions is low ; it is 0 . 3 % for all types of percutaneous exposures .    2.7840643494603956
nevertheless , there still is a need for wider adoption of safer surgical techniques to reduce the chances of hiv transmission in the operation theatre , which additionally minimize the risk of transmission of other blood - borne pathogens .    2.3233827671143086
in the case of occupational exposure to hiv - contaminated blood or body secretions post - exposure prophylaxis should be recommended stratified by the type of exposure and source material .    2.115463957119422
abstract pachyonychia congenita ( pc ) comprises a heterogeneous group of autosomal dominantly inherited conditions showing characteristic nail thickening and associated signs such as palmoplantar keratoderma , follicular keratoses , and mucosal leukokeratoses .    1.8019650295764846
less frequently epidermal cysts , UNK abnormalities , natal teeth and laryngeal involvement may be seen .    2.297979712969064
phenotypically and genetically two major forms of pc are recognized , pachyonychia congenita UNK - UNK / pc type i ( UNK inheritance in man - mim - UNK ) and pachyonychia congenita jackson - lawler / pc type ii ( mim UNK ) .    2.343965248491516
both conditions show nail deformities , focal palmoplantar keratoderma , and follicular UNK .    2.219110697537764
diagnostically relevant are leukokeratoses of the oral mucosa in patients with pc type i .    3.026897345669216
in contrast individuals affected with pc type ii show premature dentition and multiple UNK cysts predominantely affecting the upper trunk .    2.0604963422015325
the latter closely resemble UNK UNK hair cysts and UNK multiplex .    2.211828600632111
by UNK analysis keratin UNK and UNK gene mutations have been detected in patients with pc type i , and keratin UNK and UNK gene mutations have been shown to be the underlying genetic defect in patients with pc type ii .    3.163277642674691
we investigated the incidence of postoperative chest tube bleeding , administration of blood products , and changes in coagulation tests in patients with diltiazem ( dil ) administration for reduction of myocardial ischemic episodes during elective cabg .    2.507017304064845
we retrospectively analyzed the surgical and icu records of cabg patients who had recieved dil ( 27 pats . )    2.1877967283719153
or UNK ( ntg ; 26 pats . )    2.6657739030987986
or a combination thereof ( UNK ; 25 pats . ) .    2.455048225424423
data investigated included the amount of postoperative chest tube bleeding ( ctb ) , frequency of administration of packed red blood cells ( rbc ) and fresh frozen plasma ( ffp ) , and changes in hemoglobin ( hb ) , thrombocyte ( th ) levels as well as changes in prothrombin - ( pt ) and partial UNK time ( ptt ) .    2.145600748502166
there were no significant differences among the three groups with regard to UNK or operative data .    2.7714372950263493
the amount of ctb as well as the use of rbc and ffp were not significantly different between the groups .    3.002944387160798
also , there were no significant differences with regard to hb or th and pt or ptt , both in the early phase after the operation in icu as well as after 24 hours in the icu .    2.872839768582876
the perioperative administration of the calcium UNK blocker dil reduces the incidence of myocardial ischemia during cabg surgery .    2.6179257405368084
this administration during cabg surgery does not increase the risk of postoperative bleeding .    2.746729494208866
as compared to ntg , dil does not have negative effects on hb and th levels or the commonly used coagulation parameters in the first 24 hours in the icu after cabg surgery .    2.3183960945746804
depression and fibromyalgia ( fm ) share common symptoms , indicating a close relationship between both disorders .    2.0887281555350756
fm patients frequently present symptoms of major depression .    2.417301607393676
genetic epidemiological studies show that genetic transmission is one important component .    2.462525535093026
molecular genetic studies are on the way ; the serotonin UNK promoter gene seems to be associated with neurotic anxiety and fm .    2.3706692106361853
biochemical studies related to the serotonin and norepinephrine neurotransmission are disturbed in both disorders .    2.403674843671942
this view is supported by the response to treatment with antidepressants .    2.9001487462837616
at our hospital , closed dislocations of the elbow without neurovascular or osseous lesion are treated conservatively after successful reduction in the absence of a tendency to redislocation .    2.611993843058948
indications for surgery are irreducible dislocations and those with a tendency to redislocation as well as open soft tissue injuries , neurovascular and osseous concomitant injuries .    2.5574898660368652
during a period of 10 years 113 patients were treated according to this strategy .    3.0356925834340798
of these patients , 46 had simple dislocations of the elbow and 67 suffered from dislocations with osseous lesions .    2.3101570059351615
in 95 patients follow - ups could be performed after a mean period of 55 months .    2.6600702571129284
in more than 75 % of cases good or excellent functional results were documented ; unfavourable results were seen only in patients with osseous lesions .    2.9032335807506757
nearly all of the patients had a stable elbow joint at the end of therapy .    3.457785708951577
the present study investigated the frequency and influencing factors of petechial bleeding ( pet ) in the UNK and eyelids in different causes of death except strangulation .    2.8779169798047497
the highest frequencies were found in fire victims ( 31 % ) , persons who had died after intensive care ( 24 % ) , cardiac death ( 22 % ) , drowning and intoxication ( 16 % each ) .    2.6978580749037486
the frequency of pet decreased with increasing age and increased with the body mass .    2.5977393920663077
at first sight cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) seemed to influence the occurrence of pet , because the rate was 11 % without and 19 % with cpr ( UNK : p < 0 . 05 ) ; an aspect which has been mentioned in the literature .    2.288448321173461
however , further analysis showed that a higher rate of pet could only be observed in causes of death where pet are often UNK irrespective of cpr , whereas in the other groups pet ( with or without cpr ) are uncommon .    2.656367517138737
furthermore , a case - by - case analysis showed that in several cases with pet after cpr the causes could clearly be attributed to conditions other than cpr .    2.2579406466562073
in a second series of autopsy cases with only cardiac deaths ( 181 cases ) , the influence of age and body mass on the rate of pet was statistically significant and there was a tendency for more frequent pet with increasing heart weight .    2.601848964786702
on the other hand , no statistically significant influence of cpr on the rate of pet could be found in this relatively homogeneous group .    2.5374891586505073
media reports convey the impression that the incidence of fatal accidents in the european UNK has been increasing yearly at an alarming rate .    2.3731900487103035
although objective data is lacking , the annual reports of the mountain rescue services in germany , austria , the southern UNK , switzerland and the UNK region in france were analysed with respect to the fatal and non - fatal accidents which occurred between 1987 and 1997 .    2.4823170106702057
because of varying definitions of " mountain accident " used in these countries , available data about the number of fatalities are not comparable .    2.3061035500498246
a 75 - year - old man had painless , slowly enlarging tumors in the right and left UNK regions .    2.7477772678156698
clinically , the tumors were UNK and UNK .    3.0006131732134715
mr imaging and the operative exploration revealed tumors infiltrating the lateral thoracic muscles and periost of the scapula and underlying ribs .    2.0051218763599437
at surgery , the tumors were thought to be malignant , most likely liposarcomas .    2.8434890642311137
the histological examination showed the characteristic appearance of elastofibromas with spindle - shaped fibroblasts , which were separated by thick eosinophilic collagenous and elastic fibers .    2.0617450847157475
elastofibromas are benign mesenchymal soft - tissue lesions that mainly affect elderly women .    2.293341172684355
in 10 % of the patients bilateral , often asynchronous tumors are seen .    2.8884297420330296
ninety - nine percent of the lesions are located in the subscapular region .    2.749586111634078
occasional elastofibromas have been described in the extremities , head , and in the abdominal and thoracic cavities .    3.289399509249153
the relative success of thrombolytic versus surgical therapy of thrombus in transit has not yet been evaluated in clinical studies .    2.4380189034749447
only case reports of one or more patients exist .    3.076534679173443
optimal therapy , therefore , remains controversial , and conclusive recommendations in favor of one choice of therapy over the other cannot be given .    2.315954682871459
nevertheless , in current practice thrombolysis as a noninvasive and quickly available form of therapy is preferred , if no contraindications exist .    2.217386650299973
two cases are presented together with a literature review .    2.896492445059781
the UNK - UNK syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive hereditary disease .    3.4443991393014812
a 23 - year old female presented with the classical triad of ichthyosis UNK circumflexa , UNK UNK with UNK hairs of up to 12 cm length and atopic diathesis .    2.545095702654903
nevertheless , more than 20 years passed before the final diagnosis was established .    2.57038313268203
in addition , the patient was slightly mentally retarded and suffered from a genital papillomatosis , minimal UNK and a marked bilateral eyelid ectropion , more severe than previously reported .    2.4253362987341855
oral therapy with acitretin was quite successful .    2.5501562031766567
background : recent studies have shown the usefulness of pars plana vitrectomy with the use of growth factors in the treatment of macular holes .    3.198040013489854
autologous platelet concentrates contain many growth factors to stimulate glial wound healing .    2.117430673983062
in vitro fertilisation ivf and UNK sperm injection icsi are the most commonly used methods of assisted reproduction .    2.3367129135146785
whereas classic indications for both treatment options are widely accepted , for example severe UNK damage which cannot be UNK repaired , UNK , severe UNK syndrome and repeated failure of fertilisation in normal ivf , icsi might be indicated in a wider range of indications as well .    2.2166261642197407
in this paper a number of additional icsi indications are defined , for example minor forms of andrological UNK , UNK of UNK oocytes on the day after conventional ivf , reduced motility of UNK UNK , reduced quality of oocytes or icsi after one cycle of unexplained fertilisation failure in ivf .    2.435507461403226
load on the human body can be influenced by shoes and surfaces which is important both in sports and rehabilitation .    2.469416143386666
the loading which can primarily be influenced are impact situations and friction as well as the stability of the foot .    2.4818273908130024
this stability is of main interest in the prevention of pain and injury .    2.829960031884156
with optimal clinical management of patients with marfan syndrome , life expectancy may be improved substantially from 32 years to a nearly normal life span .    2.4519883387650374
cornerstones of clinical management comprise genetic counseling , life - style management , and cardiovascular surveillance , which includes regular aortic imaging and endocarditis prophylaxis .    2.0641311306936494
prophylactic use of beta - blocking agents as well as timing of elective surgery and the choice of the optimal surgical technique are difficult issues that obviously need to be individualized .    2.6616297295455067
juvenile or postoperative patients as well as pregnant patients with marfan syndrome pose particular problems .    2.6440852721860053
this review intends both to facilitate differential decision making based on UNK evidence and to provide guidelines for therapeutic strategies .    2.234226689162276
in different animal investigations pyrost demonstrated osteoconductive and UNK effects .    2.306281313659752
in ectopic tissues and especially in conditions of low UNK potency , the combination of pyrost and autogenic bone marrow effects bone formation .    2.2335185180771346
in germany , good clinical multicenter studies that are not supported by pharmaceutical companies are rarely performed .    2.275128097657714
good UNK industry - sponsored studies are usually aimed at the registration of new ( expensive ) drugs .    2.078071642739472
the preconditions for co - operation in conducting industry - independent studies which are of interest for the scientific community have been improved substantially in germany by instituting the working group of co - operating arthritis centers , the so - called core documentation where UNK patients with rheumatic conditions were documented in 1997 and the institution of a sophisticated information system ( " rheumanet " ) .    2.0808147912839563
the executive board of the german rheumatology association has set up an " ad hoc commission " that agreed to institute a " committee for the coordination of clinical studies in rheumatic diseases " .    1.9936507431026733
in this committee rheumatologists UNK from medicine , orthopedic , pediatrics working in universities , hospitals and private practice as well as specialists in statistics and epidemiology shall be represented .    2.1037306051218723
all members of the german rheumatology association are invited to cooperate with this committee by contributing to the clinically important questions and participating in clinical studies .    2.24767002929949
the committee has to define key questions in rheumatology and shall plan and UNK multicenter studies to answer these questions .    1.9823371277024453
in addition , study protocols of pharmaceutical companies may be examined as to their importance , quality , and feasibility .    2.0516648943382516
abnormal uterine bleeding is a gynecological problem frequently seen in women from adolescence to the postmenopausal period .    2.1925590666437107
nearly 70 % of patients ' visits to the gynecologist in the peri - and postmenopausal period are due to abnormal uterine bleeding .    2.639514330534481
according to the " speed " - hypothesis of cognitive development , the slowing of information processing in old age is at the core of negative age differences in psychometric intelligence .    2.154011726659413
the present study investigates the " speed " - hypothesis for fluid intelligence at the individual level using latent growth curve methodology .    2.0723555771114808
date on 4 measurement points come from the bonn longitudinal study of aging ( n = 128 , mean age 67 . 2 , 53 % women ) .    2.3556336767343753
based on principal factor analysis , markers of mental speed were the wais digit symbol test and simple psychomotor task .    1.9495000595917553
as indicators of fluid intelligence the wais object assembly and block design were used .    2.0923937094610943
after separately fitting latent growth curve models for the UNK of mental speed and fluid intelligence , a combined model showed no statistically significant improvement of fit for UNK the UNK between the two slope - factors .    2.7741344278617732
UNK this result , contrary to the " speed " - hypothesis the intraindividual change of fluid intelligence does not relate to the according change of mental speed .    2.041906902300243
for patients with dilative cardiomyopathy ( dcm ) , the prognosis is highly unfavorable , even under conditions of optimal medication .    2.8431573166506285
at present , there is no option for causal therapy .    2.9667345886982908
since there is increasing evidence that modifications of the immune system accompanied by the production of autoantibodies , e . g . , against 1 ad - UNK or UNK receptors , are involved in the pathogenesis of dcm , the elucidation of the possible functional significance of these autoantibodies has attracted increasing interest .    2.5015711250920343
in addition to the role of autoantibodies as markers for an autoimmune process , discussion of the possible pathogenetic mechanisms has centered on direct toxicity as well as on negative influencing of myocardial contractility and energy metabolism .    2.3447937755084762
the effects gained through removal of autoantibodies by immunoadsorption therapy for dcm patients UNK light on the functional importance of autoantibodies in this syndrome .    2.0933098271350574
the principle of this form of therapy is based on the binding of circulating antibodies to sepharose columns , to which polyclonal antibodies against human immunoglobulin are linked .    2.4195167257082977
a pilot study conducted among dcm patients disclosed that immunadsorption took place in simultaneous conjunction with a reduction in the immunoglobulin level and with significant hemodynamic and clinical improvement .    2.1956974446996917
these results may be interpreted as indicating that autoantibodies play an active role in dcm and that their removal by immunadsorption possibly represents a highly promising future therapeutic concept .    1.9023411674990258
active unspecific immunotherapy in an adjuvant or palliative setting has been shown to enhance survival in melanoma patients , and gene therapy now offers new perspectives for active specific immunotherapy .    2.1904735493892433
for melanoma the following approaches are suggested : vaccination with tumour - specific , hla - associated antigens using peptides or ` naked dna ' , vaccination with melanoma cells transfected with cytokine genes or UNK , UNK immunotherapy with specific t - lymphocytes or transfected tumour - infiltrating lymphocytes , or UNK of tumour cells with a tumour suppressor gene whose dysfunction plays a crucial role in melanoma .    2.003583826495538
since 1995 , a total of 115 patients with pseudarthrosis or delayed bone fracture healing have each undergone a single session of shock wave treatment .    2.231730274891517
after the treatment the fractures were correctly set according to the rules of conservative bone fracture treatment .    2.8803419423531356
the mean follow - up period for all patients was 31 months ( range 3 - 50 months .    2.707220634259284
in 87 cases ( 75 . 7 % ) bony consolidation was achieved with simultaneous reduction in the symptoms .    2.7021419701190497
apart from low - grade local reactions ( swelling , haematoma , UNK ) no complications were observed .    2.7905267342637314
the treatment is noninvasive and requires little investment in terms of personnel or technology .    2.3454332527193547
extracorporeal shock wave therapy should therefore be considered before an elaborate operative procedure is initiated in the treatment of pseudarthrosis and of delayed fracture healing .    2.581054725977289
the sound transmission properties of three different commercially available middle ear implants and the prototype of a complete middle ear prosthesis ( comep ) were evaluated with a special measurement system that permits standardized conditions .    2.1723892699349667
this system uses a mechanical middle ear model ( mmm ) which approximates the impedances of the tympanic membrane and inner ear .    1.9919103657553066
the implants were fitted under defined conditions into the mmm .    2.3936790058602386
displacement of the artificial stapes footplate of the mmm was measured with an optical probe .    2.573188754035514
the measurements of different middle ear prostheses showed that the mass of the implant was the most important factor for optimum high frequency transmission .    2.8676786591682597
the UNK implant ( 4 mg , titanium ) showed the best results .    2.5432138951161054
the comep revealed the highest sensitivity because of a slight enlargement of the diameter of the artificial tympanic membrane .    2.6608703255431507
these findings show that the comep is able to restore sound transmission to a normal range .    2.578443648466034
in a second experiment one of the implants was fitted into the mmm with different forces .    2.667745391681411
the increase of stiffness produced a slightly better high frequency transmission at the expense of low frequency sensitivity .    2.2096222382267077
hence , the fitting of the implant may not be too stiff because of its loss of mobility within a significant frequency range .    2.4576798855843025
UNK are UNK that may be found sporadically or associated with tuberous sclerosis ( m . UNK - pringle ) .    2.5528308543958844
clinically , this long - term asymptomatic tumor becomes evident as an acute retroperitoneal hemorrhage or by symptoms of a flank mass .    2.446346291510881
due to the high percentage of fat components in this tumor type , computed tomography is far superior to other radiological procedures .    2.5199898026834258
in view of two of our own case reports , the therapeutic strategies are discussed , paying regard to the actual literature in this field .    3.0573113172028865
the UNK pathogenesis of UNK ' s disease ( pd ) is still unknown .    2.9081184157053923
histopathological investigations suggest , that the metabolism of the UNK tissue plays an important role .    3.5203531033740005
therefore , we started a prospective study in order to evaluate the metabolic situation of 11 patients with pd and 11 healthy controls .    2.915082967886128
we UNK biochemical parameters of penile and venous blood , UNK correspond to the collagen metabolism ( UNK iii [ p iii p ] , pmn - UNK [ pmn - e ] , fibronectin [ fn ] , UNK [ fn - r ] und - 1 - proteinase - inhibitor [ - 1 - pi ] ) .    1.9617859217592513
there was no difference in pmn - e , p iii p , fn and fn - r in all samples .    1.986570176876119
there was no difference in penile and venous blood as well .    2.3044799185537204
but we found out a highly significant lower concentration of - 1 - pi in patients with pd ( 158 , 55 mg / dl ) than in controls ( UNK , 82 mg / dl ) .    2.9371818985195084
closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon is rare .    3.2082436906016616
fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature , perhaps because the symptoms are often neglected by the patient as well as by the doctor .    2.9502033622593036
most often the rupture occurs as a consequence of a sudden plantar flexion of the ankle and pre - existing degenerative changes of the tendon tissue due to systemic disease or iatrogenic local corticoid injections .    2.557778872284103
clinically , the tendon rupture presents as acute weakness of the ankle extensors without UNK , swelling or neurological signs .    2.2943482441573164
differential diagnoses such as anterior tibial syndrome and peroneal nerve palsy can thus be excluded .    2.2794073416901064
during the clinical examination the distal stump and the UNK of the anterior tibial tendon are often palpable .    3.2430388296073223
the clinical diagnosis can be confirmed by an ultrasound examination .    2.721456454319599
an operation may be undertaken up to 3 months after the injury .    2.729640923417742
preferred procedures are end - to - end anastomosis and transosseous refixation of the tendon , followed by a plaster cast for 6 weeks postoperatively .    2.6862582386184295
high - risk patients can be treated conservatively , but the functional results are less satisfactory .    3.333423085572807
we describe a case of an acute closed rupture of the anterior tibial tendon .    3.3119294138727695
a yet UNK method of osseous reinsertion of the tendon is presented .    2.528734072744931
in this four - part review article , an update of psychological UNK since 1988 in german speaking countries is given .    2.0088004072105683
part ii of this review focuses an personality development in old age .    2.636377611521494
in accordance with their current relevance within research on personality development , concepts and empirical studies concerned with coping , psychological UNK and development regulation in old age are addressed in the first part of this review ( contributions to basic research ) .    2.183714433335943
first , research based on the two - process - model of coping , the personality theory of UNK and the life - span theory of control is summarized .    2.8359913875769402
next , work on subjective well - being , self and self - regulation are highlighted .    2.451893807482177
in the second part of the review ( contribution to applied research ) , an overview of the scope of potential of psychotherapeutic intervention in old age is given .    2.481867020675545
background : according to literature , 30 - 60 % of pacemaker patients suffer from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ( paf ) .    2.5519614810068365
as rapid tracking of paf may cause severe symptoms in patients with dual chamber pacemakers , refined algorithms providing av synchronous pacing during periods of sinus rhythm and preventing high ventricular rates during paf are highly desirable .    2.10018702697133
if the ms criterion is fulfilled , a switch from av synchronous pacing to nontracking mode is automatically performed .    1.9845352146343287
the algorithm is described together with a discussion on optimization of the programming of parameters which may indirectly influence the ms sensitivity and specificity .    2.2488771315068936
results : this ms concept maintains the high sensitivity and fast reactivity towards paf of the " mode conversion " in UNK and UNK pacemaker systems , preventing a long time delay between onset of paf , detection of the arrhythmia , and switch to nontracking mode .    2.363873574627682
in addition , UNK sensing and short UNK periods in the new ms concept enable reliable ms .    1.9836367452201558
the occurrence of atrial UNK should be tested , as it may lead to inappropriate ms . UNK of the ms algorithm may be advantageous for individual programming with respect to the patients ' arrhythmia rate and atrial sensing performance , but the use of very restrictive or very liberal criteria should be avoided as both may lead to mode oscillations .    2.7988044657998294
finally , examples of stored diagnostic data are presented to assess ms reliability , identify possible problems , and optimize ms function during follow - up .    2.131859162546349
a number of infectious agents has been newly detected in the last 10 years .    2.862215222893947
UNK UNK and migration have been the most important factors in the emergence of new and old infections .    2.9034292957688446
additionally , new methods for the detection of dna and rna have played an important role in the detection of agents difficult to culture .    2.733724100994788
so far medical requirements for UNK have been defined by national licensing authorities .    2.441870032629969
for a long while ophthalmological problems , insufficiencies in vision , refraction or color vision , have been responsible for approximately 50 % of rejection of applicants for medical reasons .    2.190059940910649
introduction : coronary UNK disease still remains the primary cause of death in the western industrialized world .    2.4869251553774627
although the clinical value of selective coronary angiography ( UNK ) is beyond UNK , the associated risk of an invasive approach , the inherent costs and the necessary hospitalization have lead to the development and investigation of novel non - invasive techniques for coronary imaging .    2.742689463873146
intravenous coronary angiography ( ica ) has been shown to permit non - invasive imaging of the coronary arteries .    3.0925091399244073
we report nine case histories of patients admitted to a psychiatric hospital for severe somatic disorders .    2.2081281165246383
the somatic disease was either the cause of the psychiatric symptomatology , or it occurred in addition to a well - known psychiatric disorder .    2.7368720990772606
for general practitioners and psychiatrists it can be difficult to differentiate between symptoms due to psychiatric disorders and symptoms that indicate somatic disorders .    2.4862129659122076
if patients refuse the necessary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures and show behaviour that is not related to good health , there is increased risk for complications and increased morbidity .    2.581904458049974
penetrating neck injuries are potentially life - threatening injuries .    2.609830334418987
management is controversial despite decades of discussion in the literature .    2.3230357535947643
an algorithm for diagnosis and therapy is needed because of the potential risk of mortality .    3.2665006862705814
in the department of trauma surgery of vienna medical school , mandatory surgical exploration after noninvasive investigations is practiced .    2.1514924730795224
thirty - one patients with this kind of injury were treated between august 1992 and september 1999 .    2.3247588477574412
injuries were caused in seven cases by gunshots , in eight cases by broken glass , in one case by an iron rod , in one case by a UNK , in one case by a branch and in 13 cases the penetrating injuries were stab wounds caused by UNK .    2.410862702734586
complications like pseudoaneurysms and fistulas were not seen .    2.397001406378109
no patient came to death .    2.7377954885950864
during a 18 - year - period 93 patients ( f = 76 , m = 17 ) with a factitious disorder were identified in the psychiatric consultation service of a university hospital ( incidence : 0 . 62 % ) .    2.3474067280997466
50 % of women were working in medical professions whereas only 6 % of men .    2.6349567486774643
chronic courses of illness were prevailing , but at least one quarter of female patients showed an intermittent type .    2.6147700699439143
there was a classical UNK syndrome in 11 % of patients .    2.797007913610551
depressive and anxiety disorders ( 10 % , 4 % ) were to be respected as psychiatric comorbidity .    3.2174228052144027
ca 25 % of the patients suffered from a somatic illness in addition to the factitious disorder , and one third of the women had symptoms of psychosomatic , especially of eating disorders .    3.130353520285463
previous UNK disorders , deliberate self harm and attempts of suicide were to be noted in the psychiatric history of many patients .    2.2717121924134434
there were frequent traumatizing events ( UNK home , disturbing family UNK , physical and sexual abuse , early losses , serious illnesses ) in the early biography .    2.223222666957091
various psychosocial stressors could be identified in the actual eliciting situation .    2.733386897870011
the results are discussed in respect of epidemiology , development and clinical phenomenology of factitious disorders , psychodynamics and psychopathology of UNK and self harm , and therapeutic options in the psychiatric consultation service .    2.2833146639482287
in a long - term follow - up we evaluated 40 patients out of 55 ( 73 % ) with a subtalar fusion .    2.7062864629062493
the operations took place from 5 / 84 to 5 / 91 .    2.208158584290513
in all cases the indication for the fusion was a post - traumatic arthritis after an intra - articular os calcis fracture .    2.6725766052821385
the evaluation of the overall results was carried out with three different scoring systems : a .    3.057717549032007
c . the clinical rating system ( UNK ) described by kitaoka et al .    2.784230095916952
the statistical evaluation was performed by analysis of variance ( anova ) .    2.450311619039146
level of significance was based on p = 0 . 05 and calculation of UNK ' s correlation coefficient .    3.1428836320510465
the os calcis fracture was the cause for the subtalar arthritis in all 40 patients ( 33 males and 7 females ) .    2.3142154040849348
using a plaster in 23 patients ( 57 . 5 % ) , while 17 patients ( 42 . 5 % ) underwent open reduction and plate fixation ( op . ) .    3.0167169807958154
the interval between trauma and subtalar fusion averaged 3 . 5 years ( 3 months to 20 years ) .    2.5977732659221746
the interval between subtalar fusion and follow - up averaged 5 . 2 years ( 4 - 14 years ) .    2.840040894660194
the mean age at the time of UNK was 47 years ( 26 - 61 years ) .    2.4337463537247697
in the present study , complete pain relief could be achieved in 21 ( 52 . 5 % ; 58 % op . , 50 % cons . )    2.4602693276524823
a relevant restriction in the range of motion in the ankle joint was found in 26 ( 65 % ; 76 % op . , 58 % cons . ) .    2.574445820187424
in 23 patients ( 62 % ; 65 % op . , 59 % cons . )    2.4334295821191825
) , and in the UNK - cuboid joint in 14 patients ( 35 % ; 47 % . , 27 % cons . ) .    3.3057441294145904
the statistical analysis revealed a better outcome in the operative group compared with the conservative group , although the operated os calcis fractures in the majority were the more severe fracture types .    2.8831447893263924
in all evaluation systems a score between 61 and 69 points could be achieved with no significant difference between the operatively and conservatively treated groups and between the newly developed questionaire and the clinical - radiological scoring systems .    2.237586543303004
for the questionaire this fulfills the requirements for a reliable outcome evaluation .    2.286416042361816
objectives correction of an UNK fifth toe .    2.868926791815806
non - palpable breast - lesions like microcalcifications often fail an exact diagnosis .    2.2480758317971663
accurate treatment is difficult by conventional marking and operating procedures since UNK UNK of al localization wire is often UNK .    2.297893717564011
the consequences are larger tissue - defects leading to an insufficient cosmetic result .    2.2562737028194664
nevertheless , resection of microcalcifications by conventional surgery remains sometimes incomplete .    2.3809365026326135
the advantages and disadvantages of the advanced breast biopsy UNK ( abbi ) procedure versus vacuum biopsy systems are summarized and compared .    1.9394163175883217
either of those systems is highly accepted by the patients due to the outpatient manner of its application and the convincing results regarding sensitivity , specificity and accuracy of the methods .    2.7629373084634556
the histogenesis of this tumour is still disputed , in particular with respect to its stromal component .    2.856521335486578
the distribution of cytokeratins ( cks ) , cea , ema , vimentin , s - 100 protein , desmin and actin [ - smooth muscle actin ( - sma ) ] was investigated by immunohistological examination of paraffin sections from a chondroid syringoma of the apocrine type .    1.8091106020099468
the neoplastic formations have been classified into tubuloalveolar structures , solid nests / aggregations and stromal cells of varying morphology .    1.9523259531915615
the UNK cells of tubuloalveolar structures were characterized by marked expression of cks ( kl1 and mnf116 ) , cea and ema , while in the outer ones there was moderate expression of vimentin , s - 100 was expressed to a lesser extent and kl1 , weakly but there was marked and consistent expression of mnf116 .    1.9162208131551233
whereas the solid nests expressed vimentin , s - 100 protein , mnf116 markedly and kl1 weakly , the stromal cells were consistently positive for vimentin , s - 100 protein and , focally , cks and - sma .    1.8928965544339935
anti - sma specifically detects myoepithelial cells .    2.3895840399040322
in addition , the partly overlapping immunoreactivity of the intermediate filaments , membrane proteins and proteins in the different structures may indicate a common clonal origin of all neoplastic cells in chondroid syringoma .    1.815229034389382
leg ulcers may be caused by many different diseases .    2.747376465770343
most frequently , they are due to UNK , to a lesser extent to metabolic , neuropathic or hematologic diseases .    2.874131839258543
neoplasms , connective tissue diseases , infections , trauma , and UNK should also be included in the differential diagnosis .    2.9282123725511795
a 38 - year - old caucasian female patient with hereditary prolidase deficiency developed progressive and very painful leg ulcers .    2.3140551458812517
the ulcers first appeared in childhood and did not respond to various treatments .    2.707014555106072
additional features of prolidase deficiency included mental retardation , short stature , extensive dental caries , and multiple UNK UNK .    2.209016072756853
hereditary prolidase deficiency is a very rare autosomal recessive disease .    2.8435509931548064
it is caused by heterogeneous mutations of the prolidase gene and affects many aspects of protein metabolism .    2.1406845926893583
ion exchange chromatography and high voltage electrophoresis of urine can prove the suspected diagnosis .    2.026509229317397
so far , there is no efficient therapy for hereditary prolidase deficiency .    2.777317603175729
all reported treatment attempts have ended in failure .    2.24878742748711
in this paper the basic features of acute , subacute and chronic types of osteomyelitis , skeletal tuberculosis and some special forms of osteomyelitis are described .    2.0605687076895944
the diagnosis of osteomyelitis is established using clinical signs and symptoms , culture studies , laboratory studies and radiological signs .    2.3431512423373047
the common conservative and surgical treatments are discussed .    2.5162385536216085
in the treatment of post - traumatic / postoperative osteitis severe problems are encountered as a result of an increasing number of orthopaedic traumatologic surgical techniques using a variety of implants and because of a generally increasing occurrence of UNK strains .    2.75053093852783
thanks to modern treatment and the increased use of antibiotics , a considerable decrease in morbidity and mortality is observed .    2.5628704719805557
despite this improved prognosis , an established infection remains one of the most challenging problems for the orthopaedic surgeon .    2.429180672269239
besides an exponential growth in possibilities for diagnosis , treatment , and prevention in reproductive medicine and genetics , the synergistic effects of modern health technologies have led to the necessity of fast transfer of knowledge into the public domain in order to develop a common social consensus .    2.352324200431272
thus , physicians and scientists have enormous obligations not only for the development of medical technology but also of medical and societal ethics .    2.4272519949491107
very early , i . e . in 1984 , the german medical association developed professional laws for reproductive medicine .    2.4305737764880506
in addition , the german government saw the need in 1990 for an " embryo protection law " ( UNK ) .    2.138259110480244
today , in the light of european integration , the medical profession ' s and state ' s obligations are challenged in different ways .    2.376524805638586
whereas the german medical association continuously works on professional guidelines for reproductive medicine and genetics - currently the case with preimplantation genetic diagnosis - the government must develop the UNK framework for ethically sound reproductive medicine , i . e . , in the areas of inheritance law , adoption law , family law , and law of succession , the latter especially in the case of discrepancies between genetic vs . social UNK in heterologous insemination .    2.008362561157891
in crohn ' s disease , some concomitant neurological illnesses such as cerebral ischemia following arterial or venous thrombosis , subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord following UNK of vitamin b12 or folic acid , UNK neuropathy , and polyneuropathy have been described .    2.082167843339511
cerebral vasculitis secondary to crohn ' s disease seems to be a very rare phenomenon .    3.278216122899229
we report on three such cases in three female patients ( aged 26 , 29 , and 61 years ) .    2.031294883595096
all patients became symptomatic with a hemiparesis ; one complained additionally of a speech disorder , headache , and intermittent loss of orientation .    1.8780779498458404
in ct and mri scans , multiple lesions were detected ; cerebral angiography showed multiple stenoses of middle - and large - sized vessels that were compatible with cerebral vasculitis .    2.0914108559161098
serologic tests concerning vasculitis were inconspicuous at that time .    2.316498588402042
under anticoagulation ( in two cases ) and immunosuppressive therapy , neurologic symptoms disappeared .    2.6477071942970816
in the following 6 to 12 months , no new neurological symptoms appeared .    2.7925531212562062
in two cases , doppler sonographic controls showed stationary and , in one case , progressive intracranial stenoses .    2.501483318183178
the UNK protease tryptase ( UNK .    2.547370654298637
3 . 4 . 21 . 59 ) , which is almost exclusively expressed in mast cells , is released by mast cell degranulation in an UNK active form together with other mediators , e . g .    2.2867001261307722
histamine , into the extracellular space and the circulation .    2.53802341223094
the capability of the enzyme to directly stimulate several cell types as well as to UNK polypeptide hormones and to activate pro - enzymes suggests a role for tryptase in inflammatory and tissue - remodeling processes .    2.120895040900775
therefore , in the skin , a role of tryptase is suggested not only in mastocytosis and immediate type hypersensitivity reactions , but also in other inflammatory diseases , degenerative or neoplastic conditions as well as in wound healing , where an accumulation and / or activation of mast cells is found .    2.615721293952381
extracellular tryptase may be superior to histamine as a parameter for the onset and course of immediate type reactions and as an indicator for the activation of mast cells in other conditions .    2.4061386825729794
its absence during histamine - UNK reactions may suggest UNK activation .    2.1544365078314627
in addition , tryptase has been shown to be a sensitive and specific marker for the localization of mast cells in tissues .    2.793852838066419
background : since the development of lacrimal UNK with which the mucosa and disorders of the lacrimal drainage system can be examined directly , the choice of surgical technique has changed decisively .    2.631880383940171
flexible UNK can be combined with a laser for the first time , allowing for exact localization of the stenosis and subsequent therapy .    2.8321369062053074
surgery of tibial plateau fractures with joint involvement ( ao classification 41 a1 , b1 - b3 and c1 - c3 ) makes high demands on traumatological management .    1.9501672573354032
by using modern , minimally invasive operative techniques for juxta - articular fractures , it is possible to prevent soft tissue injuries that might affect the functional result .    2.5624608340457753
the aim of this technique is to achieve the exercise stability obtained with standard procedures .    2.451042156710542
arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis not only minimizes the surgical soft tissue trauma , but also enables a precise assessment of the articular surfaces under the operation , as well as the simultaneous treatment of concomitant intra - articular injuries , a particular advantage as compared to conventional operative methods .    2.613759168800714
from a total of 54 patients with tibial plateau fractures , arthroscopically assisted osteosynthesis was performed in 34 patients at our clinic from september 1994 to january 1998 .    2.6512399098527317
the follow - up of a total of 17 patients revealed good UNK when assayed by means of the lysholm and UNK score .    2.8507216329275873
we suggest that arthroscopically assisted , minimally invasive osteosynthesis can also be used in selected patients for the treatment of ao classification 41 c1 - c3 fractures .    2.633723403243181
dorsal tension band fixation is a wide - spread technique of finger arthrodesis .    2.5034588590504145
when using a resorbable pds - suture as tension band fixation a costly implant removal is not needed .    2.0578245806909767
aim of this study is the investigation of the primary stability of this technique in combination with the cup - in - cone - procedure .    3.0525561536877692
freeze - preserved fingers with thread tension band fixation using the pds - material ( series 1 ) , the same fixating method on formaldehyde preserved fingers ( series 3 ) , freeze - preserved fingers with a standard tension band fixating ( wire loop , series 2 ) are load in a four - point - bending in the direction of UNK .    2.0469504087427537
from 6 degrees onwards the wire - tension - system requires a higher torque for bending , but in case of higher torque frequently leads to fracture .    2.1915322721947064
the examination shows that the thread - tension - band method by pds - loop for the stabilisation of finger joint arthrodesis has a sufficient initial stability against bending forces .    1.9339326501860208
modern medicine has succeeded in achieving enormous technical developments .    2.265645337507646
one recent highlight has been the introduction of postmortem organ transplantation .    2.6748580630429206
at the same time , serious objections have been raised concerning the radical changes in the cultural conception of the UNK body .    2.721752673570657
one major objection arises from the conflict of considering a brain - dead person as dead .    2.1452121664981654
the presence of brain death is a prerequisite for post - mortem organ donation , because only during this phase of dying does the individual quality as dead while the organs , other than the brain , remain viable .    2.2003960015074986
the objection implies scepticism as to the physician ' s ability to distinguish a dead from a living person .    2.3085697614005856
on the other hand , even the critics must rely on the physician ' s ability to discriminate , e . g . , when to discontinue resuscitation .    2.207600278668844
the medical community has not found reasons to restrict the definition of irreversible coma 25 years after its first formulation .    2.2311564575677343
it must be clearly recognised that reasons other than medical ones can be decisive for UNK organ donation .    1.9559261459797586
one ethical problem is the therapeutic benefit of organ transplantation .    2.572630269240095
the UNK of the treatment is not the donor , but another person , the recipient .    3.2945855284931183
the concept of human dignity does not allow the use of a person UNK purposes other than the ones he / she UNK to , as UNK UNK stated .    2.5203722118018925
although the human corpse is not a person in the full sense , even if it is protected by the thought of respect for the former person , the life - interest of the organ recipient had to be considered legitimate .    2.46350223561356
the resulting conflict between the respect for the donor and the life - interest of the recipient should be balanced by seeking the donor ' s consent as far as possible .    1.9942452215327056
the proposed information model seems adequate at the moment .    2.4392705169242226
a common report of both UNK in germany in 1990 supported postmortem organ transplantation .    2.420693439460486
the report dealt with the medical problems and UNK them with the christian value of solidarity .    2.480021940844739
the ethical alternatives to organ transplantation , however , are not mentioned .    2.892324801790365
within this limitation , the report seems to adequately express the aim to strengthen individual competence and UNK for fair perception of the UNK ' s life - interest .    2.621862598458853
starting point for this analysis are the mobility needs and requirements of elderly , as well as problems concerning access and use of public transport .    2.448113686575327
elderly people as car drivers suffer from several performance deficits which are currently compensated by mobility restrictions and changed driving behaviour .    1.9405582703534079
driver assistance systems , just available or soon on the market , are demonstrated and analysed with respect to their impact on elderly drivers .    2.277812112367857
an expert evaluation comes to the conclusion that the most important systems for elderly are : emergency systems , enhanced vision systems and parking aids .    2.297781981893866
emergency systems can call rescue teams automatically or at driver ' s request , and direct them to the emergency location .    2.153080875231567
self imposed restrictions of elderly concerning night driving can partly be compensated by means of curve UNK and automatic dipping .    2.194502931406007
parking aids , using cameras or infrared technique are especially helpful for persons with UNK problems .    2.0580559097142515
the group of helpful , but not highly important driver assistance systems covers several means for longitudinal and lateral control of the car , comprising autonomous UNK control , UNK systems and electronic stability programmes .    2.201935269443152
the value and impact of these systems are analysed in the light of risk homeostasis theory .    2.43769485210386
reduced work load and ease of mobility will at last result from user centered navigation systems , helping the elder driver also to move to new areas without UNK problems .    1.7975962570936161
the article demonstrates the particular importance of specific UNK of the man - machine - interface for elderly , to guarantee high acceptance and minimal distraction from traffic .    2.2992897276860207
causal treatment regimens of proven effectiveness in controlled studies are only available for cases of male infertility resulting from UNK hypogonadism .    2.210875185543092
drug treatment of retrograde ejaculation is also effective but has so far not been tested in double - blind , placebo - controlled randomized studies .    2.288332802352776
the results of immunosuppressive therapy in cases of immunological male infertility are still controversial .    2.6149254182588715
in addition , antiphlogistic and antibiotic treatment of chronic male genital tract infections has not been shown to improve male fertility .    2.524292510241861
inconsistent results have been obtained with empirical therapy - e . g . , with UNK , tamoxifen , UNK , UNK , mast cell blockers , UNK , vitamin e , UNK , alpha receptor blockers , glutathione , UNK , interferon alpha , growth hormone , zinc salts , ketoprofen , UNK or testosterone undecanoate - or the studies performed are not sufficient to allow a final judgement .    2.751349784862615
recent studies have indicated a possible impairment of sperm function by pure fsh , while gnrh and fsh have no influence on UNK in UNK men .    2.2328053255488376
in 40 patients with alzheimer ' s disease ( ad ) , in 5 patients with non - ad dementia and in 36 cognitively normal controls the concentration of protein tau was determined in the cerebrospinal fluid ( csf ) .    2.5253766445380594
of the ad patients , 19 were very mildly demented ( UNK score from 25 to 28 ) .    2.2354035295432215
even in these patients , csf tau was significantly more elevated than in controls .    2.6066746600508197
in the non - ad patients protein tau was less increased .    2.6781521857684565
among the ad patients there was no association between csf tau and severity of cognitive impairment or deficit in cerebral blood flow , determined by spect .    2.4358919421238765
our findings suggest that csf tau may be elevated even at the UNK stage of ad and be useful as a biological marker for the early recognition of the disease .    2.4842256697485143
the aim of our review is to summarize relevant data on the perioperative use of anti - ischaemic drugs in patients at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease .    2.3246186885322864
the accessible medical literature according to current electronic information sources was explored .    2.132190484614554
one in every eight general anaesthetics is administered to a patient at risk for or with proven coronary heart disease .    2.119213238491703
of these patients , it is estimated that 20 % - 40 % have perioperative myocardial ischaemia ( pmi ) , the majority being UNK .    3.041319437131189
the anaesthetist therefore has an important role to play in reducing the rate of perioperative cardiac sequelae .    2.7001395465716618
this can be achieved with good control of haemodynamic stability and the timely and appropriate use of UNK drugs .    2.515887276366024
UNK ( nitrates , UNK ) serve as the gold standard in current angina pectoris treatment .    2.7131089159511825
acting as coronary and systemic vasodilators , they effect an immediate reduction in preload and have been shown to be the drugs of first choice for intraoperative myocardial ischaemia .    2.4068016866152986
beta - blockers reduce the rate of pmi to a greater extent than nitrates .    2.6024650312533852
they are also effective in myocardial ischaemia not accompanied by an increased heart rate .    2.5625765007823067
single pre - operative administration of beta - blockers has also been shown to be beneficial in reducing UNK of perioperative tachycardia , hypertension , and pmi .    2.4330405865021407
consequently , such one - time medication can be considered for previously untreated high - risk patients presenting for surgery .    2.5727355506173346
the continuation of oral calcium channel blockers to the morning of surgery also reduces the rate of pmi and myocardial infarction in coronary - bypass patients , and combination with beta - blockers enhances this effect .    2.319837337452068
intra - operative diltiazem infusions are similarly advantageous in this patient group .    2.3103498813589165
in addition to nitrates , calcium antagonists are the drug of choice for coronary vasospasm .    2.401299250807785
drugs inhibiting platelet aggregation have a particular role in patients with coronary heart disease , however , they also cause increased perioperative bleeding .    2.951772836021371
consequently , it is recommended that these medications be discontinued 5 - 10 days prior to major surgery , with the exception of high - risk patients .    2.783780534663079
pilot studies using alpha2 - agonists have shown reduced anaesthetic requirements and a reduction in pmi .    2.2974924097124276
the perioperative relevance of these drugs is currently being investigated .    2.745869429306733
beta - blockers , calcium channel blockers , nitrates , and possibly alpha2 - agonists lead to reduced rates of pmi and other cardiac complications in risk patients .    2.1435380666349753
current anti - UNK medications , with the exception of anti - platelet agents , should be maintained to the day of surgery and continued as soon as possible thereafter .    2.7151335162409014
inflammatory bowel diseases ( crohn ' s disease , ulcerative colitis ) were thought to be psychosomatic disorders .    2.515412026477579
however , this argument has recently been questioned by many researchers .    2.3278447451874547
at the same time , biomedical factors have been described that were claimed to play a role in the aetiology and modulation of the course of inflammatory bowel diseases ( ibd ) .    2.691081425583879
in the present paper , the state of research regarding both biomedical and psychosomatic factors of the aetiology and course of ibd is reviewed and critically evaluated from a methodological perspective .    2.239122369619692
results covering the following topics are presented : epidemiology ; sociodemographic variables ; genetic factors ; dietary factors and cigarette smoking ; drugs ; permeability of bowel epithelia ; immunological factors ; microbiological factors ; psychiatric disorders , affective symptoms , personality factors ; life events and psychosocial stress ; quality of life ; and coping with the illness .    1.9268921260699887
the question of which agents trigger the pathological immune cascade is still under investigation .    2.250802484407471
interesting findings can possibly be expected of the psycho - neuro - immunological research in this area .    2.159046421419666
results of research on psychological pathology ( psychiatric disorders , personality factors ) are inconclusive .    2.3160482904058304
in particular , some modern , well - controlled studies have not been able to confirm the findings of the older literature .    2.6985513672648436
part of the high rate of psychiatric morbidity might be due to effects of selective sampling of more disturbed subjects .    3.04445705099886
research pertaining to the influence of distressing life events has also yielded inconsistent results .    2.492573590881031
prospective studies about the association of psychosocial stress and somatic symptomatology mostly demonstrated cross - sectional correlations which did not allow for causal interpretations .    2.2338994989214034
however , coping research has shown interesting results that point to the mediating influence of coping strategies on the course of the disease .    2.095635315870054
finally , perspectives for future research are suggested .    2.515848028883244
detection of disturbances of vaginal milieu at an early stage and the use of suitable UNK such as intervention with antimicrobial substances can reduce the preterm birth rate .    2.431488482621764
a pregnancy with a partial or complete hydatidiform mole and a coexistent living fetus is a rare condition .    2.654672115570269
we report a case with a single placenta with cystic structures resembling histologically a complete hydatidiform mole .    2.226536053456704
the pregnancy resulted in a diploid female fetus in the UNK week of gestation with marked UNK .    2.7635668748584457
the non - molar part of the placenta showed a complex alteration of UNK UNK resulting in intrauterine growth retardation but a living fetus .    2.6778322971109834
no malignancy occured post partum .    2.5366106231360006
so far , necrosis of the lunate bone has been interpreted in the literature as a phenomenon with a traumatic , primarily vascular - arterial or mechanical causation .    2.253016990291559
these models seem problematic , since neither the patients ' histories nor the macroscopic - radiographical or histological appearances can be UNK with them .    2.290086142332861
in contrast , the model of a primarily venous aetiopathogenesis accepted for idiopathic necrosis of the femoral head is now examined .    2.2280349752051007
evaluation of 125 cases of lunate bone necrosis treated in the department of orthopaedics at the university hospital in heidelberg between 1958 and 1993 made it possible to reconstruct the spontaneous course of the condition .    2.574519837386164
x - ray material , core spin tomographic images and material from a prospective study carried out in 49 patients with unexplained painful conditions of the wrist were available .    2.62909182235025
a stage - by - stage progression emerged , which initially caused alterations only in the mr image , while the x - ray picture remained unremarkable .    2.4763298489252255
it was recognized from the spontaneous course that subsequent changes in the shape of the diseased lunate bones were always the result of the necrotic transformation process and never the cause of it .    2.5192017399758764
this meant that fractures were excluded as a possible cause of necrosis of the lunate bone .    2.637541497169945
the spontaneous course was used as the basis of a stage - related classification for lunate bone necrosis .    2.7527089568504657
in a pressure measurement test , the behaviour of the intraosseous pressure in 16 necrotic lunate bones , 16 healthy lunate bones and 16 healthy capitate bones was tested under various functional conditions .    2.00092789822323
the pressure fluctuations in the capitate bones were very slight , while in the healthy lunate bones pressure increased significantly during extension of the wrist .    2.2457010859755964
the position - dependent pressure increases in the lunate bones indicated that the venous drainage was constantly in UNK .    2.432449153660886
the pressure increases in necrotic lunate bones were significantly in excess of those in healthy ones ; in some cases they were far in excess of the systolic blood pressure .    2.372654626470278
it was also concluded that necrotic lunate bones were mechanically UNK on movement .    2.218652794378747
the anatomical causes of the pronounced pressure increases were examined experimentally .    2.4189068754344656
after staining of both the arteries and the veins , UNK sheet UNK was used to fix six fresh cadaver arms in the UNK position and six in extension .    2.4559371154473073
visualization of the vessels showed that capsular - ligamentous structures that were UNK on the palmar side and UNK turned back on themselves on the dorsal side still allowed the blood supply from the arteries , but substantially hindered venous drainage .    2.1315772501953925
the anatomical preparations made it possible to see that venous drainage from the lunate bone was being prevented ; this explained the pronounced pressure increases .    2.1233024022021447
the unphysiological position of the base of the radius UNK in the palmar direction relative to the hand axis when it was extended dorsally was the crucial factor in the development of necrosis .    2.727034007973937
evaluation of the histories of the patients with necrosis of the lunate bone made it clear that trauma was not significantly involved in the causation , while manual work had an important role .    2.7618197680518204
most manual UNK are performed with the wrist in extension .    2.7211890187373924
any extension UNK triggering of bone necrosis through congestion in the venous trunk .    2.1291483957610406
thus , our investigations have shown that the beginning of this illness starts with congestion such as occurs with every extension of the wrist , which is initially physiological , before further factors favouring the process cause it to take a pathologic course .    2.2588168228291448
the results of the german national health interview and examination survey 1998 confirm allergies as widespread diseases in germany .    2.260266303108599
in total 40 to 43 % of the adult population have or have had an allergic disease .    2.494298029742265
the morbidity was assessed using a self - administered questionnaire and a personal interview performed by a physician .    2.55257508927007
the agreement between questionnaire and interview data is greater than 90 % for allergic rhinitis , food allergy and urticaria and about 80 % for contact dermatitis and asthma .    2.2253701476883054
the results of both assessment methods showed remarkable differences between east and west germany .    2.1565839131757953
using the interview data 17 % of the west but only 11 % of the east german adults have / had e . g .    2.713175198220609
comparable differences exist for contact dermatitis .    2.6550921585907328
frequent patterns of combination are food allergy / allergic rhinitis and asthma / allergic rhinitis .    2.0918275357648257
in comparison with former studies we observed an increase of 70 % in the prevalence of allergic rhinitis between 1990 / 92 and 1998 .    2.707200400973288
the relative increase is higher in east than in west .    2.2926578796366277
the results show a remarkable increase here , too .    2.346433698861925
case report on a 72 year old female patient presenting with collapse and progressive dyspnea .    2.9142667922862473
x - ray of the chest showed a marked enlargement of the heart extending to the right .    3.282286281572237
echocardiography revealed an impressive displacement of the heart chambers to the left caused by a large aneurysm ( UNK cm ) located anteriorly and medially from the right heart communicating with the right atrium .    2.5115021462860234
pronounced compression of the basal part of the right ventricle was present .    3.85960015607057
within the aneurysmatic cavity several highly mobile thrombi and extensive spontaneous echo contrast were demonstrated .    1.9561288076076515
on magnetic resonance imaging and right heart UNK the aneurysm was visualized as well .    2.612729364810121
coronary angiography revealed a marked curved displacement of the right coronary artery to the left side .    3.2022315449134133
perfusion lung scanning suggested bilateral segmental pulmonary embolism proven by digital UNK angiography .    2.057858497788944
with long - term oral anticoagulation the patient remained symptomfree during follow - up of now more than four years .    2.5854010992883336
icd - 10 was implemented for morbidity coding in germany in january 2000 .    2.3975133062116707
the electronic versions of icd - 10 are introduced .    2.6412733253571252
for everyday work with the classification and for epidemiological research further tools are provided by dimdi : icd - 10 meta files , icd conversion tables , icd - 10 thesaurus of diagnostic terms .    1.690150182009667
all files are available free of charge via the internet .    2.015289513538005
hair is regarded as a product of the skin and cutaneous UNK .    3.1841326279815
possible influences of skin functions such as resorption , excretion and as a temporary reservoir for drug substances on hair analysis is discussed .    1.9962584256206108
the relevance of skin secretions and their interactions with UNK hair fibers is outlined .    2.254968257213636
for the emergency treatment of sustained , hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia , antiarrhythmic drugs are the therapy of choice .    2.4058985425171917
mostly class i antiarrhythmic drugs , such as UNK or UNK , are preferred .    3.660961087565832
in hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia , electrical cardioversion should be applied , in case of recurrences , followed by UNK treatment with class i antiarrhythmic drugs or amiodarone .    2.6393005915456755
for the primary prevention of sudden cardiac death , - blockers and / or amiodarone are the only effective drugs .    2.762577691456252
in the secondary prevention , only the implantable cardioverter / defibrillator has proved to improve the prognosis of the patients .    3.0085807061494227
insular carcinoma of the thyroid is a low differentiated type UNK about 5 % of all thyroid cancers .    3.163343609403801
higher aggressiveness has been suggested as an important clinical feature .    2.8596804046461073
the value of preoperative fine - needle aspiration biopsy is not clearly proven for insular carcinoma .    2.180665289518493
the criteria for histological diagnosis have been outlined by UNK et al .    2.2704984632187113
because of its aggressiveness , radical treatment at primary surgery appears advisable .    2.2232255850182248
its clear distinction from undifferentiated ( anaplastic ) and medullary ( c cell ) cancers is important , as UNK is regularly synthesized by cancer cells .    1.9213631939923481
UNK of radioactive iodine makes such treatment feasible postoperatively and at relapse .    2.0807899208802687
follow - up should be performed as in highly differentiated papillary and follicular thyroid cancer .    2.630531375143588
a patient series of eight cases is presented .    2.4521482125205187
while all cancers were advanced at the initial diagnosis , the observed disease courses were in agreement with the assumption that insular carcinoma is a more aggressive form of differentiated thyroid cancer .    2.1117747068353805
the result of an investigation of 128 from UNK ( 45 , 2 % ) medical and psychological psychotherapists established in the city of hannover is presented .    2.767067575378076
the aim of the study is to characterize the situation of psychotherapeutical care not only by the number of psychotherapists in relation to inhabitants but also by the working time spent for psychotherapy .    2.3752089607723605
besides we found gender , school of psychotherapy and professional experience as factor influencing the patients waiting time for beginning a psychotherapy .    2.004232375076486
in contrast to other studies , the number of medical and psychological psychotherapists is not different , nevertheless the psychotherapeutical care in hannover is not ensured .    2.5161593259610386
objectives reconstruction of the anterior cruciate ligament in children without creating permanent damage to the tibial or femoral UNK .    2.7010420304878915
the semitendinosus tendon , left attached distally , is passed through a tunnel in the tibial epiphysis , led through the joint , passed behind the lateral femoral condyle and fixed to the outer aspect of the femur with a UNK .    2.1650898091702024
the anomalous origin of the right coronary artery from the pulmonary artery is one of the UNK coronary anomalies which often remains asymptomatic until the patients achieve advanced age but may also be clinically manifest already in infants and lead to sudden death .    2.6788109280565386
we report the diagnostics and surgical treatment in a 15 - month - old asymptomatic child and the necessity of surgical repair .    2.5890538658581224
the diagnosis was incidentally made during an echocardiographic procedure and confirmed by coronary angiography .    2.20649043929716
a reimplantation of the UNK origin of the coronary artery was carried out UNK using extra - UNK circulation .    3.271403789481
there were no postoperative complications .    2.500739089932145
due to the coronary steal phenomenon and the related coronary risk , surgical repair is recommended also for asymptomatic cases .    2.2610417181772884
the surgical management of UNK fistulae ( vvf ) is a matter of controversy .    2.6337035532487194
this study deals with our experience with transvaginally treated patients suffering from vvf .    2.8089008877677597
between 1966 and 1996 , 64 patients with vvf were treated surgically .    2.569264405844836
the vvf occurred in the course of hysterectomy in 54 patients , was due to radiotherapy in 7 , was a result of obstetric complications in 2 patients , and occurred after UNK in 1 patient .    2.8699372084038086
in 60 of these 64 patients closure of the fistula was carried out transvaginally .    2.81799282154756
fourteen of these 60 patients ( 23 % ) had undergone prior surgical attempts to close the vvf ( 1 to 3 procedures ) .    2.40306907884353
transvaginal surgery was successful at first attempt in 55 of these 60 patients ( 92 % ) .    2.122615092554823
the other 5 patients were successfully treated by a second procedure ( again transvaginal : n = 3 ; transabdominal : n = 2 ) .    2.4591246661285178
in conclusion , the transvaginal approach to close vvf is of advantage , avoiding an abdominal incision and reducing postoperative morbidity .    1.9246079320895808
in the vast majority of the cases isolated vvf can be treated successfully by transvaginal repair .    2.9318883540671727
myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant multisystem disorder involving muscle , brain , heart , eyes , and endocrine organs .    2.1396945762054576
the underlying mutation is an expanding trinucleotide ctg repeat in the 3 ' prime UNK region of a UNK - UNK kinase gene on chromosome UNK .    2.431595671351935
a statistical correlation exists between the ctg copy number and the severity of the disease .    2.4017589950706197
infants with severe congenital myotonic dystrophy have been shown to have on average a greater amplification of the ctg repeat than is seen in the non - congenital myotonic dystrophy population .    2.456975440256477
however , not all patients with many ctg UNK develop congenital myotonic dystrophy .    2.488000216609027
we present 13 patients with more than 1500 ctg trinucleotide repeats and show their variable clinical course .    2.1901102218757162
whilst the incidence of psychiatric disorders decreases during pregnancy , the risk during the postpartum period increases significantly , often leading to the necessity of psychopharmacological intervention during the puerperium , and subsequently during UNK and breast - feeding .    2.3460557928676686
the necessity for lithium prophylaxis in UNK - depressive women after UNK has been identified , and it is recommended that weaning rather than omission of psychopharmacological treatment is preferable during the puerperium .    2.4236884222124315
objectives arthrodesis of the chopart joint .    2.7266151666088834
should a malalignment exist , it must be corrected prior to fusion .    2.381980815460244
elimination of painful functional disturbances and reduced need for custom - made shoes .    2.2892478752899645
in 300 patients with 339 coronary lesions the percent diameter stenosis ( % - ds ) was assessed both by visual estimation and by digital quantitative coronary angiography ( dqca ) by use of an on - line computer workstation .    2.0052006477746676
dqca measurements of the 339 stenoses revealed a normal distribution of lesion severity with a mean of 58 . 4 + / - 11 . 3 % .    2.8129666558232365
in contrast to dqca visual estimation led to a bimodal distribution with a nadir at ~ 55 % between two peaks at ~ 45 % and ~ 75 % and a mean of 70 . 5 + / - 19 . 6 % .    2.3093851204873572
visual estimation underestimated lesions in the range of 30 - 55 % and overestimated the % - ds between 55 - 99 % .    2.329532273068271
visual estimation revealed a % - ds > = 60 % in UNK stenoses ( 74 . 0 % ) of the 339 lesions , an estimate that led to subsequent " prima vista " - ptca .    2.3185410355527964
conversely , dqca revealed only 184 stenoses ( 54 . 3 % ) with a % - ds > = 60 % ; thus , 86 stenoses ( 25 . 3 % ) did not meet the morphologic indication criteria for ptca .    2.38747873323132
the bimodal distribution of stenosis severity according to visual analysis with an UNK of borderline stenosis severity reflects a tendency for " self - referral " of patients for ptca .    2.2641075411458615
dqca serves as an objective tool in the decision - making process for ptca and may reduce " cosmetic " interventions or justify to UNK ptca .    2.2915674425705714
especially in the selection process for " prima vista " - ptca dqca - quantification of stenosis severity is recommended .    2.2015570566895004
s - 100 protein and neuron - specific enolase ( nse ) serum concentrations serve as markers of cerebral damage in cardiac surgery , neurology , or after head injury .    2.128232112508814
in these circumstances , s - 100 and nse levels correspond with the results of neuropsychological tests .    2.6919637947914574
the present study investigated the diagnostic value in orthopaedic patients after joint replacement .    2.449804396162689
since its introduction in clinical use more than ten years ago , propofol is well appreciated for sedation and supplemental hypnosis in anaesthesia .    2.095479383306297
however the substance is approved only for anaesthesia in children elder than three years .    2.1516225729708083
as can be substantiated by many data reported in literature , there are no pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons UNK to withhold propofol from the younger children ; this applies both to the use as a narcotic supplement and as a short term hypnotic for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions .    2.1977933044402183
orthostatic circulatory disorders are frequently the cause of orthostatic intolerance , syncope or dangerous falls .    2.3096718491101322
three typical pathological reactions of blood pressure and heart rate can be differentiated .    2.627759185652908
the hypoadrenergic orthostatic hypotension is characterised by an immediate drop in blood pressure ( systolic drop > 20 mmhg below base line within 3 min ) with or without compensatory tachycardia .    2.2439844876094255
it is caused by peripheral or central sympathetic dysfunction .    2.446963133524369
tachycardia ( > 30 beats per minute above base line within 10 min ) without significant blood pressure drop but with a fall of cerebral blood flow indicates a postural tachycardia syndrome .    2.070756440309777
in general , there is no further somatic dysfunction .    3.021895327350351
increased venous UNK is thought to be the assumed pathomechanism .    3.070773418905942
a reflex mechanism evokes the neurocardiogenic syncope after a certain time of standing : sympathetic inhibition yields a strong blood pressure drop and UNK activation bradycardia .    1.8404591301603082
there are numerous diseases which can irreversibly UNK the whole spine or parts of the axial skeleton .    2.235397974931132
due to UNK reasons one can distinguish 3 UNK of such disorders : - paradigmatic diseases of the spine with an inherent UNK to stiffness .    2.412652956349468
- rare diseases which involve a certain danger of stiffening the spine .    2.1814808471414677
- rigidity of the spine due to scientifically unrecognised morphologic phenomena .    2.6008752889550486
modern approaches in knee UNK using computer - assisted navigation systems are based on matching procedures which refer to osseous anatomical landmarks .    2.2488946608338267
however , surface replacement techniques require a correct position of the implants in relation to the bone , as well as an optimal postoperative interaction of the ligaments and the surface design of the endoprosthesis .    2.657677266798721
functional aspects are of UNK importance .    2.7022331865223004
a 79 - year - old man died of fatal haemorrhage into the soft tissue of the true pelvis 2 days after transrectal ultrasound - guided prostatic biopsy .    2.3333730610041505
autopsy revealed a perforation of the left prostatic lobe with ruptures of the UNK vessels .    3.4124985773439938
a similar case of transrectal prostatic biopsy - associated complication has not been described previously .    2.3852184597865884
the UNK UNK were discontinued .    3.365758581548731
several different theories exist about the UNK of kinetosis and the space adaption syndrome , with individual sensitivities differing significantly .    2.364106513235995
one explanation involves the hypothesis of a different otolith mass between the right and left statolith organ and especially a difference in the UNK .    2.4734968766618013
a difference in mass results in a different sensitivity to acceleration .    2.769377585181524
for this reason we measured interindividual UNK in UNK and UNK otolith mass .    3.004240390970344
the maximum difference in mass in the UNK was 17 % and was generally smaller in the UNK , although in individual cases was much higher .    3.1346303087119063
we assume that a UNK sensitivity of the statolith organs occurs but is totally compensated for by the vestibular system as long as physiological motion patterns take place .    2.1448611183957986
UNK leads to kinetosis under non - physiological motion patterns .    2.3818008508960093
the clinical features , diagnosis and treatment of haematogenous multifocal osteomyelitis , a rare illness , are described .    2.602509806396811
of clinical note are the pain , UNK and restriction of movement .    3.2116766666644407
staphylococcus aureus was the pathogen in both of the cases we described .    2.734263705164555
sonography is a useful diagnostic tool for the localization of subperiosteal abscesses ; scintigraphy is a supplementary examination for cases where it is difficult to establish a diagnosis .    2.5006918869129113
mr - tomography is the most reliable method for examination of proximal infected foci ( spondylitis , pelvis osteomyelitis ) .    2.486220905421258
in our view , the earliest possible removal of all infected foci by means of operation and parenteral antibiotics UNK the most important treatment .    2.495093884987974
interactions between the endocrine and immune systems are well known with special regard to the hypothalamic - pituitary - adrenal axis .    2.323909152590508
little of the literature focuses on the complex effects of cytokines on tissue responsiveness to glucocorticoids ( gc ) .    2.3762694417080126
in bone tissue , osteoblasts represent a valuable model for studying gc - cytokine interactions .    2.1485634915934173
hence , we have studied two human osteosarcoma cell lines ( saos - 2 and mg - 63 ) with different degrees of differentiation and different constitutive il - 6 production ( 3 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 ( mean + / - se ) and UNK + / - UNK pg / 106 cells ) .    2.9074801729816215
we measured glucocorticoid receptor ( gr ) number and affinity as a function of the exposure of cells to different amounts of il - 6 .    2.3519921539860764
incubation for 20 h with il - 6 at increasing concentrations up to 2000 pg / ml yielded a significant increase of gr binding sites in both cell lines .    2.2531311982577567
il - 6 was also able to reverse the inhibitory effect of dexamethasone ( 1 µmol / l ) on gr in both cell lines .    2.2442724223506074
in mg - 63 cells , expressing higher concentrations of gr , il - 6 deprivation via a specific anti - il - 6 antibody ( 100 ng / ml ) significantly decreased gr .    2.2767654742122554
in saos - 2 cells , expressing lower concentrations of gr , a 40 h treatment with human il - 1 ( 10 ng / ml ) significantly increased both il - 6 production and gr .    2.296950833814638
this latter effect was completely abolished by co - treating the cells with the anti - il - 6 antibody .    2.2174788455652914
our results provide evidence that il - 6 is an autocrine positive modulator of gr number in human osteoblasts .    2.157998422252821
tumor debulking of gastrointestinal tumors for the reduction of tumor mass is intended to improve subsequent treatment efficacy .    2.3441009422696837
however , in advanced malignant disease , this therapy is often associated with increased morbidity and lethality .    2.375678314083673
adjuvant therapies cannot be initiated when needed .    2.4443341336013913
therefore , long - term survival remains unaffected .    3.0085021857796277
modern therapeutic concepts like neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced tumors are based on these findings .    2.6573836814498986
the probability of complete r0 resections , necessary to improve long - term survival , can be enhanced by these therapies .    2.6695279881573577
the ongoing prospective neoadjuvant studies for gastrointestinal tumors are already very encouraging .    2.1371012660317596
the simulation of unilateral deafness is very rare .    2.5900556104342316
objective findings are of special interest if it happens .    2.6975816219279043
a patient with UNK deafness on the left - hand side due to UNK UNK was treated in our hospital .    3.3585638026099307
pure tone audiometry showed deafness on the left - hand side and normal hearing on the right - hand side .    2.38044344585681
however , stapedius reflexes were found UNK left as well as UNK right , at 0 . 5 to 2 khz with a stimulation of UNK 90 db spl .    2.463519329214278
transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions ( teoae ) and distortion - product otoacoustic emissions ( dpoae ) were measured .    2.089180420456654
the teoae had the same reproducibility but a very low response on both sides , such that inner ear function could not be evaluated .    2.3559360524788406
in comparison , the dp gram showed clear dp amplitudes over the whole frequency range on both sides .    2.1003372421660322
UNK UNK could be excluded by assessing the dp growth rate at three different frequencies .    2.6093062379707765
by means of brainstem electric response audiometry ( bera ) , with which the iv / v complex was detectable up to stimulation with 20 db spl UNK , and the UNK test , a neural or central hearing loss could be excluded .    2.383634526566042
normal hearing on the left - hand side was thus confirmed .    2.5324336296148102
in cases of simulated deafness it is possible to prove a normal inner ear function by dpoae .    2.4781020023260516
dpoae therefore UNK the list of potential audiological simulation tests .    2.4877126064349078
however , recent prospective studies of serum cortisol and UNK sulfate ( dheas ) levels before ( x = 12 yrs ) the onset of the disease ( pre - ra ) offer an alternative perspective .    2.1353025230741816
significant dissociation of serum cortisol and dheas levels was found only in the subgroup of premenopausal women who developed ra before age 50 .    2.123705114219703
this subgroup alone had significant deficiency in serum dheas levels .    2.181176099301625
a growing number of UNK and the increasing restrictions of UNK will lead as a consequence to changes within the field of trauma surgery .    3.2379551357459144
despite these developments trauma surgery must maintain its major responsibility towards the victims of accidents .    2.032077577640995
therefore the german society for trauma surgery ( UNK ) has to face the future economic and social challenges to influence the coming changes .    2.5547021569423367
this role compromises the engagement in a continuous UNK for the high and global standard of injury care in germany , for quality assessment , education and training , research and adequate public relations .    2.3993384214617373
this paper outlines the aspects and UNK of future trauma surgery and the means which may continue to UNK international acknowledged standard of trauma care in germany .    2.283258906900178
radiofrequency catheter ablation is the treatment of choice in atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia .    2.994757237632247
electrophysiologic investigations in UNK patients revealed eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation : ablation of fast ( i ) or slow ( ii ) , modification of fast ( iii ) or slow av nodal pathways ( iv ) , modification of both pathways ( v ) , ablation of fast and modification of slow ( vi ) , ablation of slow and modification of fast pathways ( vii ) and ablation of both pathways ( viii ) .    2.2052668991435485
the criteria of diagnosis of these eight mechanisms of tachycardia ablation are described .    2.481177678046752
follow - up showed fewer relapses in patients with ablation ( 0 - 2 % ) in comparison to patients with modification of a single av nodal pathway ( 8 - 12 % ) .    3.1372173160555246
alteration of both pathways includes an increasing risk of total av nodal block , which occured in 7 patients ( 1 . 1 % ) .    2.5378098215536613
detailed analysis of the mechanism of catheter ablation is recommended in all patients after radiofrequency current delivery for av nodal reentrant tachycardia to estimate the risk of relapsing during follow - up or development of total av block in the particular patient in case of a further ablation procedure .    3.0148957267156002
an increasing life expectancy leads to a higher number of persons aged 70 - 84 years and persons aged 85 years and older .    2.4631069867413764
information concerning changes in the spectrum of psychiatric morbidity is rare .    3.3711276452686176
the berlin aging study was based on a representative age - and gender - stratified sample ( n = 516 ) of berlin UNK aged 70 - 100 years and older .    2.4572899824636734
in this interdisciplinary study , an intensive investigation was carried out by psychologists , UNK , internists and psychiatrists .    2.647477851465975
this report focuses on subjectively reported complaints ( UNK , bl ) , observed psychopathological symptomatology ( brief psychiatric rating scale , bprs ) and psychiatric diagnoses following the criteria of dsm - iii - r ( based on the geriatric mental state examination , UNK - a ) .    2.1975434560320983
on the self - rating scale ( bl ) 10 % of all persons reported severe subjective complaints , 32 % moderate complaints .    2.3942226741082693
on the bprs , 17 % showed severe psychopathological symptomatology , 75 % at least mild symptoms .    2.044939088361321
following the criteria of dsm - iii - r , 23 . 5 % of all persons had a psychiatric disease , 4 . 2 % a disease of severe intensity .    2.818352095203396
when the dsm - iii - r diagnoses " not otherwise specified " ( nos ) were included 40 . 4 % of all subjects were diagnosed by the clinical judgement of the psychiatrists to have a psychiatric disease .    2.3931077429686294
the most frequent psychiatric diseases were UNK ( 18 . 8 % ) , depression nos ( 17 . 8 % ) and dementia ( 13 . 8 % ) .    3.0586228763614516
dementia showed the well - known age - related increase , whereas no other incidences of psychiatric morbidity were age - related .    2.5927685267347664
a first overview concerning UNK risk factors and protective factors for later psychic and psychosomatic disease is presented .    2.1694265126681502
problems within the context of the collection of data and evaluation are discussed .    2.6682169967399005
we analyzed how psoriasis patients sought professional help and correlated it to their illness attitudes and feelings of stigmatization .    1.882616373223558
four groups ( " isolated " , " stigmatized " , " socially supported " and " non - stigmatized " patients ) were found and cross - UNK with five resulting groups of a second cluster - analysis concerning the " style " of the seeking behaviour of professional and UNK help and medical measures against the psoriasis ( " multi - users " , " arranged mini - users " , " waiting - room patients " , " UNK " and " self - therapists " ) .    2.221067323096012
we were able to describe typical courses of illness behaviour depending on the initial reaction .    2.5974517304851816
the results are discussed with regard to the desirable identification of problematic patients within professional care units .    2.3029816467772135
the sonographic diagnosis of malignant lymphoma in childhood is described .    2.895905041974957
malignant lymphomas are sonographically relatively uniform : initial enlargement of the lymph nodes and organs involved and disturbance of normal echo texture by mainly UNK lesions can be found .    2.2833663652507137
generally , four sonographic patterns of infiltration are described : diffuse , small nodular , large nodular and bulky type .    1.9366096990204118
secondary , tumor - related or inflammatory complications ( e . g . dislocation or compression of vessels , thoracic inlet syndrome , venous thrombosis , ileus , urinary retention , abscess and effusion ) can be sonographically evaluated .    2.291555621267198
response to therapy correlates with normalization of size and echo texture and recovery from tumor - related complications .    2.3489831189866344
differential diagnosis with ultrasound is based on the topographic distribution and echo pattern of infiltration and , with certain restrictions , on the UNK of lesions and perfusion feasible with doppler sonography .    2.767277359205365
the primary diagnosis has to be established histologically .    3.3002950017025596
the treatment of acute posterior instabilities can involve a reconstructive procedure as well as an UNK augmentation .    2.8037766310190713
tibial bony avulsion ruptures must be reconstructed .    2.422341415496013
for the treatment of chronic posterior instabilities we used the patella tendon graft , which can be implanted by an anterior or posterior approach .    2.8598436812985097
in cases of posterolateral instabilities , additional procedures are necessary .    2.358429593559537
ultrasound of the achilles tendon is a suitable means of differentiating various diseases of the tendon and the surrounding tissue .    2.64308328783546
different forms of degenerative disease ( tendinitis , UNK or bursitis , UNK , and UNK ' s disease ) can be UNK from rheumatic and metabolic diseases .    3.4908533139034503
congenital and developmental abnormalities can also be detected .    2.8418823486972675
tendon degeneration mainly occurs in the ventral part of the medial third of the tendon ( " critical zone " ) .    2.995703714150578
immature tissue in this area leads to UNK instability of the tendon with a high risk of rupture ( " vulnerable phase " ) .    2.8666756694115088
with sonography , lesions of the achilles tendon are visible early in the course of the disease .    2.7904795445821113
the german social security legislation has recognized only recently the concern of quality assessment in the field of social and medical services .    2.240928796516741
the legal frame for quality assessment in the field of medical treatment was UNK in the sickness insurance provision ( social code - book v ) only in 1989 .    2.4481409967830023
quality assessment is considered to be a part of the production of medical services and , therefore , is regulated in the context of providing medical services .    2.988843850760604
the legal provisions do not establish standards for quality and quality assessment .    2.2903139088304454
due to the variety of medical services , quality assessment is not regulated in an exhaustive or systematic manner .    2.456402320577319
according to the law , providers of medical services ( doctors , hospitals ) are bound to participate in quality assessment .    2.283388344067033
as internal quality assessment prevails in the definition of the various measures of quality assessment and the control of quality in all fields of medical treatment , external quality assessment is also prescribed for hospitals .    2.78062017007756
because the establishment of quality assessment is considered to be a part of the service production organization , consumers ( patients ) or their representatives are not involved in the definition , establishment , and control of quality assessment .    2.6444521022370715
the participation of patients should be provided by law .    2.9993506074874365
introduction : because of an increasing number of endoscopic hernia procedures , it is important to look into the possibility of UNK these techniques helping surgeons to acquire the operative skills necessary .    2.5392018931392015
material and methods : to discuss these aspects , the documented data on tapp operations that have been carried out in this department since 1993 were analyzed .    2.372175371567813
the results of teaching procedures were compared with those of experts after they had UNK past the learning and development curve .    2.345567765342834
results : a total of 778 teaching procedures were performed by 10 surgeons with an individual experience of 30 . 5 operations ( median ) .    2.292996939344118
before starting the first procedure , 89 were done by assistants operating the UNK .    2.2999629094988365
the morbidity of teaching operations was 1 . 9 % compared to 1 . 4 % for those performed by experts .    3.335418139903392
after a median follow - up of 23 months there were two recurrences ( 0 . 23 % ) in the expert group and none in the teaching group ( follow - up 16 months ) .    2.902584726144084
therefore , tapp is suitable for application in a routine setting .    2.6136797618861993
in spite of the high and lasting efficiency of transurethral prostatectomy , intraoperative blood loss results in increased morbidity in this procedure .    2.3088531428783807
this led to the development of many alternative treatment modalities in the last years .    3.3455050126931685
to minimize the risk of bleeding , we improved the high - frequency technology in several steps .    2.8083680865722367
to achieve this , the output signals of commercially available high - frequency generators were modulated to the effect that each cut results in an efficient coagulation zone in the tissue at excellent cutting quality .    2.200566589520028
laboratory and in vitro studies using porcine kidneys as well as clinical trials showed good cutting characteristics accompanied by a significant reduction of bleeding .    2.809254052386067
as a result , blood transfusions were less necessary , the transurethral catheter could be removed earlier in the postoperative period , and hospitalization time was significantly reduced .    2.2872212823406053
in conclusion , the improved high - frequency technology in form of the " UNK intermittent cutting " results in a blood - sparing tissue resection with a consecutive reduction of morbidity .    2.4410809095508754
clinical publications have UNK dealt with this problem .    2.405183141618025
we therefore examined 20 legal autopsies performed at the institutes of forensic medicine of the universities of würzburg and leipzig as well as the respective records of the police and UNK UNK ' s offices in an effort to clarify this question .    2.3544179665146907
as a rule the victims retained the ability to act for 10 - 15 min .    2.475127065630361
however , the material we examined and the literature also contain cases in which the ability to act lasted considerably longer .    2.662744571281682
the present study is intended to provide expert witnesses with guidelines for clarification of cases of fatal intoxication .    2.295152481301446
androgenablation is the therapy of choice for the treatment of advanced and metastatic prostate cancer .    3.1128575426685603
however , in more than half of the patients the disease will ultimately progress within 2 years .    2.8083636102395118
intermittent androgenablation through medical UNK maintains the apoptotic potential .    2.271141569241113
by periodically changing phases on and off treatment the quality of life of the patients is improved .    2.988122403383048
in how far survival is influenced is presently not clear and remains to be evaluated in further clinical trials .    2.345633280950742
during pressure support ventilation ( psv ) , the timing of the breathing cycle is mainly controlled by the patient .    2.5710924054087028
therefore , the delivered flow pattern during psv might be better UNK with the patient ' s demands than during volume - assisted ventilation .    2.4501013063993984
in several modern ventilators , inspiration is terminated when the inspiratory flow decreases to 25 % of the initial peak value .    2.50483125069412
however , this timing algorithm might cause premature inspiration termination if the initial peak flow is high .    2.0875756710141684
this could result not only in an increased risk of UNK between the patient and the ventilator , but also in reduced ventilatory support .    3.2648380002617383
on the other hand , a decreased peak flow might inappropriately increase the patient ' s inspiratory effort .    2.239123851636828
the aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of the variation of the initial peak - flow rate during psv on respiratory pattern and mechanical work of breathing .    2.349412169572757
to date , positron emission tomography ( pet ) is the most powerful tool for the non - invasive study of biochemical processes .    2.790762993689863
besides its usefulness for basic research pet has been proven to be superior to conventional diagnostic methods in several clinical indications .    2.4478872498338666
however , the introduction of pet into clinical practice has been hindered considerably by its costs .    2.4314864505862546
several american studies lend support to the hypothesis that pet may be more cost - effective than the conventional diagnostic work - up - at least for some of its clinical indications .    2.4010299634635492
in germany , however , this hypothesis has still not been verified .    3.29424887988777
the rapid growth , development and organ differentiation during early human development depend on an adequate and balanced substrate availability .    2.062444174259497
on growth ) , and that marked metabolic imbalances in infancy ( e . g .    2.5891249766807314
hypoglycaemia , phenylketonuria ) have long term effects on child development .    2.335580394384991
more recent studies indicate that also variations of metabolic conditions within the normal range , which occur during sensitive periods of early human development , may have marked long term effects on later prognosis and disease risks in adulthood .    2.0267962885664974
this metabolic programming was demonstrated in epidemiologic studies indicating close relationships between indicators of early growth and the disease incidence and the mortality of coronary heart disease in late adulthood .    2.276217697304248
long term effects of infant feeding on immunological functions are indicated by the effects of infant UNK on later prevalence of allergic disease and by the difference in morbidity for diabetes mellitus , crohn ' s disease and malignant lymphoma between previously breast fed and formula fed infants .    2.2656089462994133
an improved understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that modulate these observed long term effects is required to enable effective preventive interventions .    2.4543524364282883
already the available information indicates a great potential for actively improving long term child health and development by an improved substrate supply during pregnancy and infancy .    1.9825120059441685
persons who cross international boundaries are at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases .    2.468711730477992
an analysis of the reported UNK diseases in germany shows : a large number of cases of UNK fever , UNK fever , UNK infections , UNK and UNK UNK during the last years in germany originated from foreign countries .    3.179946354289724
intervention measures are necessary , above all , with regard to gastrointestinal infections and vaccine - preventable diseases .    2.3672554233134075
bilateral testicular tumors account for approximately 3 , 5 % of all testicular malignancies and to our UNK about 800 cases are reported in the literature .    2.5899819402577156
an even more seldom event is the appearance of a testicular germ cell tumor with a contralateral benign non - germ cell tumor .    2.2319358158102443
we report the 6th case of such a coincidence .    2.6301387117803516
the dignity of a contralateral tumor should be assured by frozen section and in case of benign histology organ preserving therapy is indicated .    2.149294160703166
even in cases of bilateral testis cancer tumor enucleation may be considered , if the strict conditions for resection and follow - up are respected .    2.8404449960334297
most sudden cardiac deaths are arrhythmic .    2.5364891454706555
besides the known effects of beta - blockers , among true antiarrhythmic drugs only amiodarone seemed to reduce total cardiac mortality in patients at risk .    2.1723146593179723
reevaluation of amiodarone with or without a beta - blocker in primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death after review of recent publications .    2.219025658492801
only augmentation of case numbers by meta - analyses of controlled trials could demonstrate that amiodarone not only reduces sudden cardiac death but also diminishes total cardiac mortality .    2.0089319518161557
however , the number of avoided sudden deaths is small in comparison to the number of treated cases .    2.966416256440569
this and specific side effects of amiodarone UNK a general primary prophylaxis with this drug .    2.56753455771076
an additional benefit by combining amiodarone with beta - blockers seems to exist but has to be proven by further studies .    2.475637181242781
at present , primary prophylaxis of sudden cardiac death with amiodarone with or without a beta - blocker is an individual decision in all cases with special risk considerations .    2.216572587436886
as a result of a critical review of the literature and a survey at german epilepsy centers of usual pre - and postoperative drug treatment , the following strategy is recommended :    2.5963552590473022
an ecological theory of UNK is formulated which is based on the patterns of meaningfulness in the social and spatial environment .    2.798759895470574
the specific ecological relationship to the environment is UNK , and also opens access to the UNK of the past .    3.5957199624722667
in the present study , conditions for this access ( in particular with older people ) were investigated .    2.4125866588202594
it is assumed that older people , especially , when they lose UNK with whom they had a fixed relationship seek counselling and that abrupt changes in the spatial environment , such as moving to a home , are rejected by older people .    2.094642562426274
these hypotheses were checked on the basis of material ( n = 120 ) gathered in a counselling service for the aged and they were essentially confirmed .    2.3029249014093294
to make matters clear , " typical " and thus every - day experiences of maintenance and loss of competence are cited from the material .    1.9866837991157802
finally , practical conclusions are drawn with regard to work with the aged .    2.697182440329484
following shouldice repair of a primary inguinal hernia 50 patients were given subcutaneous redon drains , while another 50 patients underwent operations without drains in a prospective randomized trial .    2.122060165823144
the amount of postoperative wound secretion in the drainage bottle was added to fluid retention established by sonographic volumetric analysis .    2.0437817837645635
the degree of personal impairment was estimated by a visual analogue score .    2.7219996629253758
inflammation parameters were recorded as well as the rate of complications .    3.783905869475654
the drain group showed significantly increased fluid production in comparison to the group without drains on the 1st postoperative day ( 36 . 0 vs . 2 . 5 ml ) .    2.681566925479031
wound sepsis was found in two patients in the drain group .    3.7085760766694156
seven patients with drains and eight patients without underwent percutaneous seroma puncture .    2.1759652536913854
the drain only slightly affected personal impairment ( 25 . 6 % vs 21 . 4 % , visual analogue score ) .    2.602618417342062
body temperature was elevated in the drain group on the 3rd day after operation ( 37 . 2 vs 36 . 7 °c ) .    2.4078791693640653
instead , percutaneous puncture of subcutaneous fluid UNK should be performed .    2.431064624973064
we report on three arterial thromboses of the external iliac artery following total hip replacement .    2.1278888761328356
as a result of implanted cement / spongiosa or protrusion of the acetabular component , the iliac vessels were compressed .    2.0616922101379713
furthermore , we report about one intraoperative arterial vessel lesion in a 65 - year - old patient during a revision operation .    2.498443546377708
we recommend that in case of acute ischemic syndromes of lower limbs following total hip replacement , an angiography should be performed in order to exclude an extravascular cause of thrombosis .    2.7932249819507713
for therapy in those cases extra - anatomic bypasses should be preferred to UNK .    2.4840563837932677
one of the most important UNK of manual therapists is the treatment of hypomobilities of intervertebral joints .    2.7704598734448904
such hypomobilities of the spine are treated with different kind of manipulations or UNK .    2.5673804957967015
the pathophysiological basis of hypomobilities is subject of discussion .    2.463213013618279
objective criteria for the diagnosis of disturbed spinal mobility are missing .    2.9838819747444125
they are not detectable in x - ray , UNK or nmr .    3.2357901512702756
in this article , we report on a family in which five examined members showed clinical signs of UNK syndrome , a condition which consists of hearing loss ( 49 % ) , UNK ( 100 % ) , leukocyte inclusion bodies ( 100 % ) , eye anomalies ( 54 . 3 % ) , and nephritis ( 38 . 7 % ) .    3.075511287016143
this article describes how tissue culture has developed from an observing method to a powerful analytical technique for oncology and for pathological cell changes such as metabolic disorders and degenerative diseas es .    1.835889291653963
standard terms are defined and basic methods are explained .    2.3412247972739393
different models of in vitro culture - UNK , three - dimensional tumor cultures , and organ cultures - are critically reviewed in respect of their significance for the interpret UNK of in vivo tissue .    2.578822808399508
two important recent extensions of tissue culture , serum - free cell culture and the introduction of genetic material into cells , are described .    2.1851360434276974
the objective of this prospective , randomised study was to investigate the incidence of postoperative nausea and / or vomiting ( ponv ) during the first 24 h postoperatively .    3.141045457598297
for a quality assurance study on ponv , we compared two established general anaesthetic procedures in UNK patients undergoing four different types of surgery ( subtotal thyroidectomy , laparotomy for gynaecological procedures , laparoscopy , and surgery for extra - abdominal procedures ) .    2.1087544348030587
the historical opinion that the intima layer of a ruptured artery of muscular type could stop bleeding by " rolling in " should be controlled experimentally .    2.013693264672201
furthermore a longitudinally split and a partially oblique UNK segment were ruptured .    2.0878293669852237
as morphological findings a UNK deformity was observed in the region of rupture .    2.8629049600968677
this phenomenon was induced by adventitia layer , which closed the ends of ruptured media layer like a chinese finger trap .    2.025137688637891
in the longitudinally split segment a transverse rupture of the media layer could be observed , while the fibers of adventitia layer were pulled out when the traction was continued .    2.2380094194726707
neither UNK nor microscopical signs could be found for " rolling in " of intima or media layer .    2.0413775253801605
the reason for spontaneous hemostasis after arterial rupture is more likely the activation of platelets by collagenous fibers of adventitia layer than " rolling in " of intima or media layer .    1.8790444074588815
if there is no finger trap mechanism of adventitia layer like in shot - or UNK a massive blood loss must be expected .    2.2920800661796057
time and again a lack of staff in the field of people ' s nursing is discussed ( chronic lack of nursing staff ) ; this means that there are not enough people to do the available work ) ( 1 ) .    2.317585097601843
however , the time factor is also an important sociological dimension in old people ' s stationary care .    2.309598220123234
first of all , this article points out the time dimension throughout life .    2.3532664793025604
this is followed by people ' s varying perceptions of the present and the related UNK and misunderstandings .    2.6370916626940324
hereby the contradictory abundance and limitation in time as felt by the elderly also becomes apparent .    2.0806397006542543
the old people ' s awareness of the dwindling remainder of their own UNK conflicts with the seemingly UNK time of each day that UNK .    1.985397904444831
intravascular ultrasound ( ivus ) has evolved to a research tool to an intrinsic part of modern invasive cardiology .    2.0907500146157947
the main reason is the capability to obtain " in - vivo " micro anatomy by means of miniaturized echo - transducers with an outer diameter of 2 . 9 - 3 . 5 french .    2.504645680850217
for the first time it is possible to base decisions not only on UNK but also on vessel wall assessment .    2.626143650527245
the capabilities of ivus can be divided in its diagnostic and intervention associated potentials .    2.4241885670329912
the diagnostic strength of ivus is the ability to monitor compensatory coronary artery enlargement as a response to arteriosclerosis , to assess intermediate lesions , to reveal occult left main stem disease , and angiographically " silent " arteriosclerosis .    2.0160355947270756
in conjunction with the estimation of intracoronary flow reserve , patients with the diagnosis of coronary " syndrome x " can be better classified into those with or without early signs of arteriosclerosis .    2.841934153913262
additionally , ivus is at present the only method allowing the classification of coronary artery lesions according to the aha / acc UNK classification .    2.661058716347654
introduction : the chronic UNK compartment syndrome of the UNK tibialis anterior is thought to be responsible for a major part of complaints of the lower leg among active UNK .    2.717849807013275
there is an important role of tissue pressure measurement in diagnosing chronic anterior compartment syndrome during muscular activity .    2.5686622214776063
however , there is a controversial debate about the relevant parameters .    2.5513721630276422
the development of frontal sinuses following bilateral fronto - orbital advancement is a topic of controversial discussion in the literature .    2.153678309697568
in a retrospective study on 33 patients ( 15 girls and 18 boys ) the development of the frontal sinus was examined radiologically .    2.6825835385616643
only patients with a minimum age of 6 years and with at least 1 year of postoperative follow - up were included .    3.04569602230069
the radiological reference for the frontal sinus development consisted of UNK at or above the level of the UNK rims , as projected in postero - anterior UNK .    2.5305523037957958
according to these criteria a frontal sinus development was seen in 72 . 7 % of our patients .    2.8372282043968755
there was no statistically proven correlation between sinus development and the sex of the patient , age at surgery or the amount of advancement .    2.6686949945308043
favourable results can be obtained with the standard four - screw technique , preservation of the ankle and the biomechanical axes seeing only one non - union in 44 own cases with this technique .    2.444686135101265
a vital x - ray imaging technique in oral and craniomaxillofacial surgery is the panoramic x - ray .    2.582070580612503
due to its variety of special projections , including imaging of the transversal level and low exposure to radiation , it is suitable for answering many clinical questions and for diagnostics of various findings .    2.3403607397526742
it has become possible to minimize the necessary doses by further development of technology and devices , as well as of x - ray films and by new detection systems , such as sensors or screens .    2.6893974525347475
in some clinical cases , the diagnostic deficiencies of conventional imaging techniques make computed tomography ( ct ) and magnetic resonance ( mr ) imaging indispensable .    2.3624864507633165
although mr is particularly suitable for soft tissue imaging , it has also become helpful in finding cortical changes by shorter measuring times .    2.095717999459499
in certain cases , e . g . , changes to bone metabolism , differentiated methods of nuclear medicine make image - aided analysis of function possible .    2.253614618667424
secondary haematogenous joint involvement is seen in less than 1 % of patients with salmonella infections .    2.9448893025310072
these atypical infections are frequently encouraged by pre - existing local or systemic disease .    2.459660853635517
we present a case of a patient with known alcohol abuse who developed a septic infection of her right hip requiring resection of the femoral head .    2.6612666595869237
histologic analysis showed signs of pre - existing osteonecrosis probably induced by alcohol intake .    2.54362304860481
initially , a biopsy evaluated without knowledge of the positive bacteriological result had been interpreted as indicative of a tumour .    2.2920347995695893
the onset , clinical course , diagnosis and therapy of joint involvement by salmonella are discussed with regard to our case and the relevant literature .    2.699939125152245
this case illustrates the necessity for clinicians to share all their information about the patient with the pathologist .    2.690864007867358
there are two types of diabetes mellitus .    2.7783869937685632
type i , insulin - dependent diabetes ( iddm ) , which becomes manifest before the age of 40 , is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin .    2.7172871741488067
type ii , the non - insulin - dependent diabetes ( UNK ) , develops in the elderly and is caused by a relative insulin deficiency .    3.2776482053464084
patients with type - i diabetes are prone to the development of ketoacidosis , while type ii causes UNK , hyperosmolar , nonketotic coma .    2.3764690654015155
apart from these acute metabolic alterations , the long - term complications of diabetes are of concern to the anaesthesiologist .    2.324796705821296
hypertension , coronary artery disease , renal insufficiency and autonomic neuropathy are common and can result in myocardial ischaemia , cardiovascular instability and UNK , with an increased risk of aspiration .    3.1310155450232573
limited movement of the atlanto - occipital joint can cause difficult intubation .    2.3832463460157274
to avoid perioperative metabolic UNK , blood glucose concentration should be kept between 6 . 7 and 10 mmol - l - 1 ( 120 - 180 mg - dl - 1 ) .    2.335692574343952
hypoglycaemia can result in neurological damage , whereas hyperglycaemia causes impaired wound healing and susceptibility to infections and worsens ischaemic damage to the myocardium and brain .    2.352749079063723
perioperative diabetes management depends on the severity of the surgical procedure and the type of diabetes .    3.353259171537749
all type - i diabetics , UNK operation being performed , need insulin .    2.263971315655171
the intravenous route is recommended as it allows better adjustment .    2.666836970183299
after determination of the fasting blood glucose level , insulin is given at a dosage of 0 . 5 - 1 u - h - 1 ( at gluc < 11 . 1 mmol - l - 1 ) , 1 . 5 - 2 u - h - 1 ( at gluc 11 . 1 - 16 . 7 mmol - l - 1 ) or 3 u - h - 1 ( at gluc > 16 . 7 mmol - l - 1 ) .    2.4607550802957006
in addition , 5 - 10 g glucose - h - 1 is given .    2.668967407603386
in type - ii diabetes the oral UNK drug is UNK .    2.4704139268691425
during minor surgery the blood glucose concentration is monitored frequently , and if necessary insulin ( with gluc > 13 . 9 mmol - l - 1 ) or glucose is given .    2.1932490849623427
in most cases of major surgery insulin therapy will be necessary .    2.395268431764479
administration should follow the guidelines listed for type - i diabetes .    2.3275931299612553
whether the intravenous or the subcutaneous route is used for insulin , repeated glucose determinations are mandatory .    2.1938956403853633
if ketoacidosis develops the volume depletion is treated with normal saline .    2.337144971052473
for hyperglycaemia and acidosis insulin ( 3 - 6 u - h - 1 ) with 10 - 20 mmol - h - 1 potassium phosphate is given .    2.5259339812239086
bicarbonate is only indicated when the serum ph is lower than 7 . 1 .    2.7894757808355424
it must be borne in mind that perioperative management of diabetes does not end with UNK care .    2.1590741681600374
at the beginning of the 19 th century , institutional care for the UNK was established by the various german states .    2.696778373637264
at first , the separation of curable and incurable patients influenced psychiatric care and the construction of hospitals .    2.3225049051208955
the combination of care and cure in one hospital in UNK was a turning point in institutional care .    2.4178536697497086
contradictory tendencies characterized the second half of the 19 th century : the integration with general medicine in the cities , on the one hand , the social separation and cure in the UNK of the countryside , on the other .    2.582855696141082
the characteristic psychiatric construction in different countries was influenced by individual UNK .    2.2228971991667477
the following building styles were dominant : in UNK , UNK architecture ; in the united states , linear staggered structures ; in france , the " UNK UNK " ; and in germany , the structure of blocks with cross - axes .    2.6563756416826436
from the first world war until the end of the UNK s , a standstill in psychiatric buildings was noted in germany , and institutional care came under increasing criticism .    2.562269955178424
there was a reorientation from the middle of the 1970 s as a result of more effective therapeutic possibilities .    2.4916937372611647
a variety of complementary institutions , outpatient and partly inpatient therapies , which were recommended by the " psychiatrie - enquête " , started to be realized .    2.341311231307092
smaller units and different models of integration of psychiatric care , such as building the hospital next to a general hospital or psychiatric wards within a general hospital , became relevant criteria for planning the construction of psychiatric hospitals , as did the integration into the community and the city .    2.18511382780318
principles of organization like the construction of a communicative UNK inner room , or grading the rooms from public to private , were structurally integrated .    1.8959776907586148
specific structural requirements for the construction and design of psychiatric hospitals should be evaluated in more detail by post - occupancy methods .    2.2597073473410454
it allows the open reduction of complex fracture sites and facilitates UNK , UNK or calvarian bone harvesting .    2.612337219321854
by this method , primary treatment can be optimised and the rate of secondary corrective surgery can be reduced .    2.9466289629953826
all trauma patients who underwent this kind of intervention were re - examined to check functional and aesthetic results .    2.463520040614029
one case of a newly described , rare odontogenic tumor is reported .    2.6689474398851565
a literature review of 19 cases lends support to the odontogenic origin and metastatic capability , both regionally and UNK , of the clear cell odontogenic tumor .    2.1993164148397377
we conclude that this tumor is malignant , with a tendency to recur locally after surgery .    2.526475155084436
it requires an aggressive surgical approach and should be referred to as a clear cell odontogenic carcinoma .    2.6037327341614507
the histological differentiation of this type of tumor from other clear cell tumors is difficult .    2.5094799106351133
as the elderly segment of our population expands , there is an increase of therapeutic problems considering this age group .    2.5632879582718378
the elderly patient is generally susceptible to infections because of the decline in host defense mechanisms that occurs with aging , and the underlying chronic diseases of these patients .    2.6021459420855515
increasing numbers of elderly people are being treated in hospitals and are additionally at particular risk of acquiring nosocomial infections with antibiotic - resistant organisms .    2.167666046043582
this article focuses on the epidemiological considerations , risk factors , types of infections that occur in elderly patients , and the guidelines for empiric therapy .    2.8513963352481686
the most common infections of the elderly are respiratory tract infection , urinary tract infection , and skin and soft tissue infection .    2.8985868654672036
empirical therapy should be broader in spectrum for elderly patients since the variety of UNK bacteria tends to be greater and the choice of antimicrobial therapy must be based on risk stratification ( age , medical illnesses , and severity of presentation ) .    2.2065573320959913
many additional aspects , e . g . , route of administration , drug pharmacokinetics and UNK , drug toxicity and drug - drug interactions , compliance , and multiple underlying diseases ( e . g . , renal failure ) must be considered in the rational selection of antibiotic regimen .    2.4124429252574777
we present long - term results ( minimum follow - up 5 years ) in 145 patients with advanced non - UNK germ cell tumours , who underwent radical retroperitoneal lymphadenectomy ( UNK ) after chemotherapy .    3.02830290568094
we correlated patients ' outcomes ( death of disease ) to different kinds of chemotherapy and to intraoperative findings .    2.2079206907814863
we found that patients who were treated by a modified UNK scheme with cisplatin , etoposide and bleomycin have a good prognosis .    2.585418460684064
in all , 90 % showed no evidence of disease ( ned ) .    2.6498403257352456
the ned rate was significantly lower in patients who were treated by sequential alternative chemotherapy ( UNK = 37 % ) . we determined the following prognostic factors which predict a poor outcome : .    2.683834307847309
follow - up studies after stent implantation of native coronary arteries have reported reduced rates of angiographic restenosis .    2.3724201699262397
in contrast , stent implantation in the treatment of obstructive disease of coronary artery bypass grafts is complicated by higher restenosis rates .    2.815238890878173
we sought to determine , if different predictors contribute to the high restenosis rate following stent implantation of coronary artery bypass grafts .    2.6591732503842547
we investigated long - term angiographic outcome of 205 stent implantations performed in 177 patients .    2.39634882285742
multivariate analysis correlated clinical , procedural and angiographic variables with the incidence of angiographic restenosis defined as diameter stenosis > 50 % at follow - up .    2.192134567181228
angiographic restenosis was observed in 34 % of lesions treated .    3.0177071930101067
multiple logistic regression analysis defined diabetes mellitus ( or 6 . 89 , ci2 . 41 - 9 . 69 ) , graft recanalization ( or 2 . 69 , ci 1 . 08 - 6 . 63 ) , lesion at the aortic anastomosis ( UNK . 98 , ci2 . 76 - 19 . 25 ) , lesion at the coronary anastomosis ( or 2 . 95 , ci1 . 18 - 7 . 49 ) , high diameter stenosis after stent placement ( or 7 . 01 , ci 2 . 64 - 15 . 71 ) , placement of long stents ( UNK . 78 , ci1 . 11 - 7 . 36 ) and implantation of more than one stent ( UNK . 34 , ci2 . 08 - 20 . 15 ) as independent predictors of graft in - stent restenosis .    2.1342748826326745
critical consideration of these variables may help to identify patients who are poor candidates for stent implantation and who may benefit from different interventional approaches .    2.5779288397558004
to compare the conventional 2 - d , the simulator - guided semi - 3 - d and the recently developed ct - guided 3 - d brachytherapy treatment planning in the interstitial radiotherapy of breast cancer .    2.2995442425296706
in 103 patients with t1 - 2 , n0 - 1 breast cancer the tumor bed was UNK during breast conserving surgery .    2.2722801083963895
fifty - two of them received boost brachytherapy after 46 to 50 gy teletherapy and 51 patients were treated with brachytherapy alone via flexible implant tubes .    2.1912182861507135
single , double and triple plane implant was used in 6 , 89 and 8 cases , respectively .    2.295060887385258
the dose of boost brachytherapy and sole brachytherapy prescribed to dose reference points was 3 times , 4 . 75 gy and 7 times 5 . 2 gy , respectively .    2.0278981522045885
the positions of dose reference points varied according to the level ( 2 - d , semi - 3 - d and 3 - d ) of treatment planning performed .    2.7701679764671185
the treatment planning was based on the 3 - d reconstruction of the surgical clips , implant tubes and skin points .    3.079334911867452
in all cases the implantations were planned with a semi - 3 - d technique aided by simulator .    2.2904565829443393
in 10 cases a recently developed ct - guided 3 - d planning system was used .    2.4731693565884414
the semi - 3 - d and 3 - d treatment plans were compared to hypothetical 2 - d plans using dose - volume histograms and dose non - uniformity ratios .    2.199270650797241
the values of mean central dose , mean skin dose , minimal UNK dose , proportion of UNK clips and mean target surface dose were evaluated .    2.0896044293576175
the accuracy of tumor bed localization and the conformity of planning target volume and treated volume were also analyzed in each technique .    2.1070376537958664
with the help of conformal semi - 3 - d and 3 - d brachytherapy planing we could define reference dose points , active source positions and UNK times individually .    2.008857667646889
this technique decreased the mean skin dose with 22 . 2 % and reduced the possibility of geographical miss .    2.754125985363822
we could achieve the best conformity between the planning target volume and the treated volume with the ct - image based 3 - d treatment planning , at the cost of worse dose UNK .    2.2844594485767002
the mean treated volume was reduced by 25 . 1 % with semi - 3 - d planning , however , it was increased by 16 . 2 % with 3 - d planning , compared to the 2 - d planning .    3.5690200116062964
the application of clips into the tumor bed and the conformal ( semi - 3 - d and 3 - d ) planning help to avoid geographical miss .    2.2179512227450213
ct is suitable for 3 - d brachytherapy planning .    3.3818404276411522
better local control with less side effects might be achieved with these new techniques .    2.4567998101306237
conformal 3 - d brachytherapy calls for new treatment planning concepts , taking the irregular 3 - d shape of the target volume into account .    2.5460891722260026
the routine clinical application of image - based 3 - d brachytherapy is a real aim in the very close future .    2.3976216895513787
background : staphylococci represent an important source of external infections of the eye .    2.4090430663719555
in addition to acute staphylococcal conjunctivitis a spectrum of subacute or chronic disease may be found .    2.3057237296369024
according to UNK und UNK , with this staphylococci - associated UNK - kerato - conjunctivitis in culture - positive cases s . aureus is found in 31 % and s . UNK in 69 % of smears .    2.2080429947278106
UNK and toxic mechanisms are the underlying etiology .    2.552982194543998
multiple organ failure ( mof ) may occur early or late after trauma .    2.3240549675383364
besides direct physical injury of organs , compromise of the microcirculation by inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of mof .    2.300325869264276
inflammation also induces UNK responses which may end up in immunoparalysis .    2.234062322824071
as a result , infection and sepsis with additional inflammatory damage to the microcirculation ensue thereby contributing to the late development of mof .    2.223546982111108
in addition to this biphasic model of posttraumatic mof , there is evidence that inflammation and immunoparalysis do not only occur in sequence to each other but in parallel early after surgical procedures .    2.0999354156208203
the aim of the present brief review is to summarize the posttraumatic mechanisms of inflammation and immunoparalysis and to discuss how to differentiate between both pathophysiologic states .    2.238518736042828
early enteral nutrition is widely accepted for its support of organ structure and function ( " gut injury hypothesis " ) and reduction of infectious complications and hypermetabolism in critically ill postoperative or UNK patients .    2.216445515405407
nineteen severely injured patients ( injury severity score 40 . 3 + / - 11 . 6 ) were studied for the feasibility of early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube .    2.532859788937054
despite maxillary fractures , UNK and blunt abdominal trauma the enteral feeding was mostly started immediately after trauma .    2.4992529062181035
intermittent diarrhea or constipation resolved after reduction of the feeding rate within 1 or 2 days .    2.448475828910559
total enteral nutrition could not be realized in all cases ; a central venous line was always additionally necessary .    2.85938093535879
however , the goal was not complete enteral nutrition but a continuous enteral supply to maintain the integrity of the gut .    2.2192718438325443
the study has shown that early enteral nutrition via a duodenal feeding tube is also feasible in severely injured patients .    2.085581568872884
the expenditure to overcome the technical and organizational problems seems to be justified .    2.8159711096136184
definition of the problem : the rapid pace of medical progress has drawn renewed attention to the various possible ways of treating dead or brain - dead pregnant women since the 1980 ' s .    2.0349579414120202
the discussion today UNK around medical , social , legal and economic aspects .    2.2635611558439446
the historical areas of conflict which surrounded deliveries carried out on dead mothers ( usually by means of a UNK in UNK , nowadays known as a UNK caesarean section ) and their significance in today ' s debate are , for the most part , regarded as being of little relevance .    2.5399417844519236
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( pcp ) is one of the most frequent infectious lung diseases in immunocompromised patients , especially in aids cases .    2.6766484379629523
the present case report describes pulmonary miliary microcalcifications with and without foreign - body reaction in a patient with successfully treated pcp who was known to have aids .    2.4507589715455533
this form of residues of completely healed pcp tends to be rare .    2.3160115506881276
other infectious granulomas , foreign - body granulomas and sarcoidosis must be differentially diagnosed .    2.0968045605772785
after UNK decalcification , UNK can be demonstrated with UNK silver ( UNK ) .    2.6615257026861117
it is important to be aware that pcp can also undergo spontaneous cure , so that miliary microcalcifications may then be the sole pointer to the presence of aids .    2.2388931814925557
background : in congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21 - hydroxylase deficiency high pre - and postnatal androgen levels are present and might influence UNK and psychosocial development in affected girls .    1.918897213180863
we report on the results obtained by structured interviews of adult patients ( 45 ) and their mothers ( 35 ) covering difficulties and problems in general , most aspects of their medical histology , self image , body image and current life with or without a male or female partner .    2.1693122751911815
results : the patients were socially competent with a well developed social network .    2.539753365929838
however , regarding sexual contacts they were UNK and reluctant .    2.529368138499865
these resulted in significantly less patients live with a partner or are UNK .    2.2146254774840193
existing UNK were more stable and satisfactory than in the control population .    2.863928728559185
the incidence of UNK was not increased .    3.00930611952226
the number of women having children was significantly reduced .    2.555958910549517
a substantial number of women suffered from androgen - dependent problems like UNK UNK and UNK .    2.649897890204668
mothers and patients denied any sex - specific UNK , but the girls had preferred boy - specific toys and competitive UNK games .    2.2586300033415276
however , school performance was average and comparable to the controls .    2.4620234767201663
most mothers expressed problems and questions regarding their daughters UNK at birth .    2.12518419637335
even though they felt they had received good medical treatment , mothers as well as patients felt they would have needed more psychological help .    2.2947023715082393
conclusions : it seems that adult female patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia are able to adapt to their impairment and chronic disease .    2.3567228675409657
problems regarding partnership , sexuality , and fertility remain and have to be addressed .    2.5091810445714766
introduction : orthotopic liver transplantation ( olt ) has become an accepted treatment for end - stage liver disease .    2.36836521826597
however , postoperative complications result in significant patient morbidity and mortality .    2.4043954224011452
early detection and treatment of these complications is therefore of utmost importance .    2.9912758241642083
materials and methods : we retrospectively reviewed the postoperative complications of the patients who underwent olt at our institution .    3.1093575575645773
duplex doppler sonography and cholangiography were the primary imaging modalities in postoperative evaluation of the transplanted liver .    2.9389906184368266
other important techniques were ct , mri , and angiography , which may contribute to a reliable diagnosis of vascular or biliary complications .    2.480651664480635
results : second to primary organ dysfunction , vascular complications are the most frequent cause of graft loss .    2.4738967063858746
thrombosis of the hepatic artery is the most common and most serious vascular complication , with a reported incidence from 4 to 42 % .    2.618696616250687
bile duct UNK , leaks and strictures are frequent complications after liver transplantation , which can contribute to graft dysfunction .    2.3739514606322745
biliary tract complications usually occur within the first 3 months and require interventional radiological or surgical therapy .    2.424860184225802
since liver transplant recipients undergo immunosuppressive therapy , they are at increased risk of developing late post - transplant malignancies , which are best depicted by us , ct or mri .    2.5065608615052426
conclusion : cholangiography and duplex sonography are routinely used in the postoperative evaluation of patients with olt .    3.259526829236455
ct , mri , and angiography are problem - solving tools in equivocal cases .    2.337502395473683
it is understood that the tumor recurrence is due to residual micrometastases not found during surgery or UNK ( peripheral blood or bone marrow ) .    2.247610910408555
we developed a procedure to detect non - visible , abdominal metastases using a radiolabeled anti - tumor cell antibody injected before the operation ( UNK surgery , UNK ) .    2.2464363330505663
based on the knowledge of disturbing humoral immune reaction is mounted against shed tumor associated antigens ( taa ) , we developed a new method to reduce and correct the b cell response and b cell recruitment due to chronic taa UNK complex presentation on follicular dendritic cells ( immune corrective surgery , ics ) .    1.968075381350776
this method is based on a selective lymphadenectomy .    3.4296299381513755
the target lymph nodes were those loaded with taa - immune complex .    2.2278095968155363
the detection method used was the injection of radiolabeled antibody able to recognize the immune complex .    2.234583537876073
from 20 patients ( stage i , ii and iii ) treated with ics , 17 survived more than 5 years ' showing a statistically significant increase of survival compared to patients treated with standard procedures .    2.351847524589511
in conclusion , these data show that surgery of colorectal cancer should be selectively extended to specific anatomical regions in order to remove hidden micrometastases , and more importantly , correct postoperative immune processes that could suppress the t cell response against residual tumor cells .    2.1364823843620635
knowledge of normal and impaired pulmonary gas exchange is essential to the anaesthesiologist .    2.764410022155725
analysis of an arterial blood sample allows evaluation of whether or not pulmonary gas exchange is normal .    2.4460614007729173
for this purpose comparison with the oxygenation index or the alveolar - arterial po2 difference is helpful .    2.316606653712113
pathological changes of these variables are mainly caused by ventilation - perfusion ( v . a / q . )    2.3758298469379917
in daily practice , venous admixture or intrapulmonary shunt can be calculated using arterial and mixed - venous blood .    2.295630975681606
by analysing arterial and expired pco2 , dead - space ventilation can be determined , but extended analyses of v . a / q .    1.9541077006163738
distribution are not possible in daily practice .    2.9888122611934764
however , knowledge of the principles of typical disturbances of pulmonary gas exchange in acute and chronic lung disease allows the use of therapeutic strategies based on the pathophysiological changes .    3.0602162768784487
background : infectious endocarditis can lead to embolic arterial retinal occlusions .    2.368126363413595
the case of a 30 year old man with UNK is presented .    2.87499379471233
the congenital disorder is UNK by a lack or major reduction of UNK , an enzyme that UNK the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water .    2.584817578820747
the defect is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion .    2.4367246290892313
occasionally the defect UNK as progressive oral gangrene or UNK ' s , disease .    2.587370713033199
poor longterm success has been reported for penile vein ligation the last few years .    2.379080492507574
therefore , we decided to re - investigate our group of 147 patients who were operated on between 1987 and 1996 .    2.4936685398282745
all patients showed a negative response to intracavernous injection therapy at the time of diagnosis and revealed a maintenance flow > 15 ml / min , as well as a pathological venous flow with UNK or UNK .    2.7623943172571455
these patients underwent ligation of all superficial dorsal veins and resection of the deep dorsal vein of the penis .    2.48973868377183
an up - to - date record of the success of the operation was kept either by a renewed clinical visit or by a standardized telephone interview or questionnaire .    2.4169177477269517
a total of 126 patients were available here for long - term follow - up .    2.4024452469021123
we divided the findings into three groups : complete spontaneous erection , postoperative response to cavernous auto - injection therapy and no changes in erectile UNK postoperatively .    2.026805366646384
the short - term success rate for these groups after 1 - 3 months was an outcome of 31 ( 24 . 6 % ) , 25 ( 19 . 8 % ) and 70 ( 55 . 6 % ) patients ; 86 % of the cases whose results deteriorated after the initial operation success rate had this happen within the first postoperative year ( p k 0 . 001 ) .    2.880294074303943
favorable prognostic factors were preoperative erectile dysfunction of k 7 years , a normal cc - emg and a maintenance flow of k 45 ml / min .    2.2566308196887346
if all three parameters were present , the long - term success rate ( spontaneous erection plus response to intracavernous injection ) of 30 % of all patients was found to rise to 67 % in this selected group of patients ( p k 0 . 001 ) .    2.6772018620125184
this study reveals that long - term success for unselected patients undergoing penile venous surgery is disappointing ; however , careful selection of patients by certain prognostic factors can improve long - term results .    2.4108700838747077
pyoderma gangraenosum can cause great therapeutic problems .    2.412762412585446
high UNK corticosteroids are the treatment of choice .    2.909359066316301
however , UNK pyoderma gangraenosum or side effects from corticosteroid treatment may require therapeutic alternatives .    2.027187765150196
pyoderma gangraenosum responds excellently to treatment with cyclosporine a .    2.5175881717251105
because of side effects and drug interactions , the patients must be selected and carefully and closely monitored .    2.741163526210078
six patients with pyoderma gangraenosum , unresponsive to various topical and systemic therapies , were treated with oral cyclosporine a at mean daily doses of approximately 3 mg / kg .    2.3173623173276354
marked improvement of the skin lesions and complete healing occurred in all patients over a period of 3 - 6 months .    3.5060373714160646
only one patient suffered a relapse after discontinuation of the treatment .    2.685577252541911
the results show that low - dose cyclosporine a treatment can be considered a first - line treatment of pyoderma gangraenosum .    2.7972901861084103
medical treatment of injured patients by international UNK of non - governmental organisations in crisis areas and out - of - area operations by UNK , and also national UNK require special trauma management .    2.450068469077586
deviations from peacetime surgical guidelines are obligatory because of long - distance medical evacuation , the possibility of gaps in supply and the typical pattern of war injuries .    2.1291902493806507
massive contamination combined with the high risk of infection is one typical attribute of wounds inflicted during a war or a disaster .    2.5486784079853932
in contrast to peacetime surgical guidelines , aggressive wound débridement is often needed .    2.0720234841229157
timely and prophylactically prescription of a broad - spectrum antibiotic with a long half - life has great importance in the treatment of these wounds .    2.6047358505463136
suitable antibiotics for these indications are : UNK / UNK and UNK .    2.7324649349689483
nevertheless the use of antimicrobial agents will only be effective with early surgical débridement .    2.5744859696060254
craniofacial development may be potentially implicated after vault corrections in cases of craniosynostosis .    2.5194720888247533
the aim of this prospective study was the investigation of the surgical effect on calvaria growth , correlating the percentiles of a group of patients before and after craniosynostosis correction in relation to the normal percentiles of growth .    2.5385718452825783
the patient population consisted of 71 children ; the postoperative follow - up time in 57 patients was more than 12 months .    2.412703474922376
of the children followed up , 36 were male and 21 female .    2.5593426042501886
thirty - six cases involved untreated non - syndromic craniosynostosis ; the remaining 21 were syndrome cases .    2.0701863615580915
the patient ages ranged from 16 to 27 months .    2.2962700525559856
in 11 cases correction of an occipital craniosynostosis was carried out .    2.5053625275934195
the fronto - occipital circumference was registered in accordance with prader ' s percentile table .    2.25507037214304
the operative method included a fronto - parietal craniotomy , the temporary removal and UNK of the fronto - orbital band and a vault cranioplasty .    2.3673838524664657
during follow - up 13 patients treated with fronto - orbital advancement in cases of isolated craniosynostosis remained in the registered percentile curve .    2.749894053204617
in 13 patients a change to a lower percentile curve was confirmed ; 1 patient changed to a higher curve .    2.5691371972833124
in cases of syndromic craniosynostosis 10 patients remained in the post - operatively registered percentile curve ; 8 patients changed to a lower and 1 patient to a higher percentile curve .    2.4100639228951923
no growth restriction of the UNK calvaria after surgical correction of craniosynostosis was observed .    2.9192322009360563
today a large number of operative procedures on retroperitoneal organs can be performed using minimally invasive techniques .    2.863223457512449
the retroperitoneal space can be reached laparoscopically through the peritoneal cavity or by the direct retroperitoneoscopic approach .    2.2877971273345827
the correct anatomical placement of the first trocar is of particular importance in procedures with the patient in lateral decubitus position in order to avoid injuries .    2.908565989582106
the overview is worse than in conventional surgery because of the UNK effect of the UNK , which is , furthermore , positioned very close to the operative field .    4.120674493324121
it is therefore of great importance for the surgeon to use anatomical structures for orientation .    2.6525904999364482
the decisive anatomical aspects and landmarks in different minimally invasive operations on retroperitoneal organs are outlined .    2.0367499075651474
lipid peroxidation is considered a prominent feature of age - related retinal degeneration .    2.653804131334632
it is known that lipid peroxides can UNK UNK .    2.278542616180152
this property was used to localize lipid peroxides UNK in the retina .    2.949104264355457
in a 73 year - old male patient with generalized atherosclerosis , known infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm , renal artery stenosis , and coronary artery disease , an aneurysm of the proximal left subclavian artery was successfully excluded by implantation of a UNK - peripheral stent graft .    2.6474755217811805
angiographic follow up after 6 and 12 months showed an excellent outcome with complete exclusion of the aneurysm .    2.7088617140318356
intravascular ultrasound showed no neo - intimal hyperplasia within the stent .    2.1730791207109563
a computed tomography revealed complete thrombosis of the aneurysm .    2.929611890656459
based upon our increasing knowledge of mechanisms underlying tissue destruction in ra patients , new therapeutic principles have been developed , aimed at blocking proinflammatory cytokines or using antiinflammatory cytokines .    2.016142443915372
both principles , however , have proven to be very effective .    3.440194980670074
in addition , the availability of the methodology to transduce cells with genes has initiated first experiments in animal models to test whether gene therapy for arthritis is suitable , followed by a first , very carefully formulated protocol for human ra .    2.0750644117666277
gene therapy for ra has to still be considered as an experimental form of therapy in a very early stage , not allowing even now any serious treatment offer to ra patients .    2.3636228564337527
several problems , such as the question of a suitable vector system have not yet been solved .    3.1721649766324767
with more experiments this therapeutic principle might become available and might prove effective even in a disease with a systemic character like ra in the coming years .    2.078685733902321
in the case of typical whiplash after low - energy rear - end collision we recommend a clear and structured therapeutic regimen to overcome and prevent neuromuscular deficits .    2.071887819963607
patients with bony and UNK lesions have to be excluded , as well as patients with distinct neurologic deficits .    3.117306894470193
a therapeutic rationale is the basis of full neuromuscular recovery ad integrum .    2.635114398780084
the UNK of success in ether anesthesia on 16 october 1846 in UNK spread like UNK through europe .    2.1150779154683357
in the german - speaking countries , the national newspapers as UNK of the development played a prominent role ; this was especially the case for the UNK UNK UNK whose correspondent , aloys martin [ 1 ] , was a medical professional .    2.6271897895014193
the function of local newspapers has not yet been investigated .    2.759108744743502
this was to be remedied by examining both of bamberg ' s local papers .    2.0964857015404292
all issues from 01 . 01 . to 31 . 04 . 1847 were surveyed with respect to relevant UNK .    2.366550949036279
these were then UNK according to date , extent and contents .    2.739146801341725
starting on 22 . 01 . 1847 , the events outside of and in bamberg were reported on in 26 UNK and articles of just a few lines to half a UNK and in advertisements ; aloys martin also appears on the scene .    1.977643442418161
true arterial aneurysms of the UNK vessels are a rare finding .    3.4328823068230343
during surgical treatment of UNK aneurysms of the popliteal artery and the tibiofibular trunk we discovered a complete spontaneous rupture of the thrombotic aneurysm of the right tibiofibular trunk .    2.8837404508014197
we describe the special features of diagnosis , histology , and the surgical treatment of aneurysms of the crural arteries .    3.0291829428012407
we recommend that even asymptomatic aneurysms be electively operated on to prevent further complications .    2.135844601563294
dementia is going to be one of the major challenges of the next century for our societies due to the enormous burden on the health care systems .    2.6325307580756943
dementia is the major cause of death and the most important risk factor for disability and entry into a nursing home in elderly people .    2.800824532369655
moreover , because of the progress in the treatment of alzheimer ' s disease , in particular with the cholinesterase inhibitors , demented people will be more often and detected earlier by general practitioners and families .    2.840169816976293
nowadays operative sperm retrieval in connection with assisted reproduction is a well - established procedure in urological - gynecological cooperative groups .    2.283236870571432
microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration ( UNK ) and testicular sperm extraction ( tese ) are the fundamental procedures in cases of non - UNK obstructive azoospermia or testicular azoospermia .    2.8193230347322853
as they are often favored percutaneous techniques such as percutaneous epididymal sperm aspiration ( UNK ) or percutaneous testicular sperm extraction ( UNK ) , need to be in anglo - american countries and the countries of northern europe , discussed regarding their efficacy ( number of retrieved UNK ) and possible testicular injury due to blind or ultrasound - guided puncture .    2.262764105630188
in middle UNK , one of the larger bavarian administrative division ( population 1994 : 1 , UNK , 101 ) , the number of patients suffering from cancer pain , chronic headache and chronic back pain is not known .    3.0751280916807056
furthermore , there are no data on interdisciplinary organization of outpatient pain management .    2.471536217098841
a 34 - year - old hiv - infected african woman developed fever , weight loss and widespread papules on her trunk , arms and face .    2.14084409756439
skin biopsy and culture revealed histoplasmosis caused by histoplasma capsulatum varietas capsulatum ( american histoplasmosis ) .    1.9227858174444517
even though antimycotic treatment and intensive care were started immediately the patient died because of the systemic mycosis within a few days .    2.86591563663766
histoplasmosis is a rare disease in europe but endemic in some areas of the usa ( e . g .    2.429309537125822
ohio , UNK ) and of africa .    4.036222656864745
additionally histoplasma capsulatum varietas UNK is endemic in central and south africa .    2.146300307478978
as a consequence of scientific advances , an increasing number of patients with advanced age , reduced myocardial performance , previous cardiac surgery , UNK , and emergency indications are referred for cardiac surgery .    2.7057685440192394
risk factors can be divided into pre - , intra - , and postoperative patient - , structure - , and procedure - related .    2.6429656833473647
on the basis of this risk prediction , the perioperative course can be optimized by an individually tailored UNK and interdisciplinary management .    2.0833860609417765
unnoticed , minor damage to the unidirectional respiratory valves of the draeger respiratory circuit may lead to intermittent and unpredictable malfunction , resulting in UNK and hypercapnia .    2.5283055060399313
the damage may be so minor that normal visual and functional test UNK may be insufficient to detect it .    2.0970939261600123
we report one case of a potential life - threatening malfunction of the inspiratory valve and also propose economical solutions utilizing altered construction , modified machine - check procedures , or a simple instrument that adds only one step to the machine - check procedure .    2.1109622298428574
the general problem of minor but functionally important damage to parts of ventilatory equipment - so - called borderline damage - may not be limited to this particular model or manufacturer .    2.1639191619277875
most users of ventilatory equipment believe that equipment that UNK through normal check procedures is either fully functional or non - functional .    2.0738219692538777
in reality , this is not the case .    3.5439910368325354
intermittent malfunctions due to slightly damaged equipment may be missed with normal machine - check procedures .    2.1236271830022475
this problem results in a significant but UNK increased in risk to patients .    2.5577490214107934
because of unclear UNK of intermittent malfunctions caused by borderline damage , there also is an increased forensic risk for the anaesthesiologist .    2.136773486858858
the risk of mechanical malfunction might be displaced by software problems in new - generation ventilators in the market .    2.0551469347712947
purpose : to investigate whether the margins of microscopic tumors can be delineated better with UNK iron oxide UNK ( UNK ) , a superparamagnetic contrast medium , than with gd - dtpa by magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) .    2.243501771069619
nonunion of the ankle malleoli is extremely rare these days .    2.778705568727796
today nonunions of the malleoli are seen , if at all , is infected cases after surgical procedures .    2.1032114877351447
UNK , stable and painless nonunions usually do not need any surgical correction .    2.2532520207622175
in painful cases , small fragments , especially of the medial malleolus , should be resected ; larger fragments should be stabilized with two 3 . 5 - mm cancellous screws .    2.609710333570537
alternatively , the tension banding technique , especially after weber a fracture , produces high compression in the area of nonunion .    2.1721901426161967
in cases of additional bony defects , a local upside down cortical - cancellous bone graft should be performed in addition .    2.399369112059517
infected nonunions with loss of bone mass should be treated according to the guidelines for osteitis therapy .    2.9868394172973836
this study investigated the influence of the patients ' educational level on indication for and duration of psychotherapy and the choice of treatment methods ( psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy or psychoanalysis ) .    2.940637427064711
we considered treatments that were conducted within the framework of the statutory health insurance in germany .    2.1948594026994015
data were collected from the therapists ' case history ( n = UNK ) , submitted to the first author as an expert of the statutory health insurance companies .    2.6769232329230808
we found a significant relationship between level of education and indication for psychotherapy .    2.432070373721443
in our sample 43 . 5 % had graduated from senior high school compared with 25 . 1 % in the average german population .    2.5712136866442026
this relationship is getting more clear if we discriminate between psychodynamically oriented psychotherapy and psychoanalysis .    2.080874102552667
51 . 7 % of the patients undergoing psychoanalysis had graduated from senior high school and only 13 . 2 % from junior high school compared with 48 . 7 % in the average german population .    2.645102825775071
also the duration of psychotherapy depends only on the level of education , not on gender , age or type of statutory health insurance .    2.8518825594028296
these results are discussed carefully and questions for further investigations are UNK .    2.5305172938546816
after the initial enthusiasm subsided UNK of the prostate has been criticized because the extent of tissue destruction cannot be controlled and many patients may be expected to have significant postoperative obstructive as well as UNK voiding symptoms which may last for weeks .    2.855043520585829
thanks to new UNK techniques these disadvantages have been largely eliminated .    2.2101605676997664
with the UNK laser a real resection of prostatic tissue is possible allowing the surgeon to see the prostatectomy defect immediately and to assess tissue destruction during the operation ( " what you see is what you get " ) .    2.0773508109550782
the postoperative voiding disturbances are diminished and comparable to those after tur - p .    2.3378124232451936
the classification of acetabular fractures and especially the diagnosis of additional lesions can be misleading , when the personal experience is limited and the decisions are based only on conventional radiographs .    2.7046215383119456
the introduction of spiral - ct with multiplanar reformations and 3 - d views has improved the quality of visualization .    2.8185302575166906
due to their higher costs , the need of these additional diagnostic tools is frequently questioned .    2.502846091397019
this paper discusses the relevance of plain radiographs , 2 - d - cts , 3 - d - cts and UNK - cts ( UNK ) for the classification of acetabular fractures , based on a controlled study .    3.1545705977812584
methods : thirty physicians with different levels of experience in acetabular surgery were divided in three groups of 10 each : group i comprised residents without operative experience in acetabular surgery , group ii was physicians with 3 - 10 years of operative experience , and group iii was experts in acetabular surgery .    2.1496152981934724
a total of 10 complete radiographic cases of high quality providing all levels of preoperative diagnostics ( plain radiographs , 2 - d - ct , ct with multiplanar UNK , 3 - d - ct , fs - ct ) of different acetabular fracture types were prepared .    2.2538768704744703
the task for each candidate was to classify the fracture according to letournel and to identify all additional injuries within the hip joint ( e . g . marginal impaction , head fractures , etc . ) .    2.0979719050767502
the different diagnostic " levels " could be ordered stepwise according to personal need and no time limit was given .    1.9256062280225812
the case was finished when the candidate presented his final diagnosis .    2.148466482711352
the use of the different radiographs , the preliminary diagnosis , the changes in diagnosis , and the final decisions were recorded .    2.9672477374252115
these findings were correlated with the different levels of experience and against a " consensus classification " which was generated by thorough discussion , and the use of intraoperative information and postoperative radiographs not accessible to the candidates .    2.5075653037281995
results : the " correct " fracture classification based on plain radiographs was : group i , 11 % ; group ii , 32 % ; group iii , 61 % .    2.5381848190573493
based on 2 - d - ct a " correct " diagnosis was reached by 30 % in group i , by 55 % in group ii , and by 76 % in group iii .    2.9642322658503555
with consideration of the " transient forms " in acetabular fractures based on letournel and the 3 - d - ct used mainly by group i , the rate of " correct " classifications rose to 65 % in group i , 64 % in group ii and 83 % in group iii .    2.785527459334741
the modifiers were diagnosed " correctly " in group i by 37 % , in group ii by 56 % , and in group iii by 73 % .    2.8476715069204945
the use of the 3 - d - ct and especially the fs - ct by group i resulted in an improvement in the rate of correct classifications to 61 % , whereas in group ii the fs - ct was used only UNK .    2.7947557419717763
the 2 - d - ct was the basis for the diagnosis of the additional lesions in acetabular fractures within all groups resulting in 73 % complete diagnoses in group iii .    2.6871362921228275
this study showed the importance of ct for the exact analysis and classification of acetabular fractures .    2.7904256372923895
in particular , the secondary reformations in ct and the 3 - d - views dramatically improved the rate of " correct " classifications in the group of surgeons with limited personal experience in acetabular surgery .    2.4638869756538666
this allows the less experienced an acceptable level of " correct " diagnoses , so that the treatment options can be weighed correctly .    2.359991202664347
among the " experts " a rate of divergent UNK of approximately 20 % was observed , especially in " transient " forms of acetabular fractures .    2.439945250610546
background : UNK is the clinical sign of lens subluxation .    2.815255569666941
acute glaucoma caused by a UNK block may develop .    3.195533053298541
yag iridotomy or peripheral UNK are rarely effective in controlling intraocular pressure .    2.1856581443300596
the results of phacoemulsification and posterior lens implantation for UNK lens and glaucoma are reported .    2.004287129140741
cerebral perfusion reserve may be determined by assessing changes in cerebral blood flow using vasodilators .    2.441646557797504
transcranial doppler ( tcd ) may be used to measure cerebral blood flow speed in response to such stimuli .    2.7958214834875923
the aim of this study was to analyze cerebral UNK in patients with high - grade carotid stenosis and to determine the short - and long - term effects of desobliteration .    2.8686499182696945
a total of 40 patients had bilateral preoperative studies done and 24 were re - evaluated 1 year later .    2.1211178829479462
the preoperative vasomotor capacity using tcd with co2 was 57 % + / - 45 .    2.493607658407588
hemodynamic reserve did not decrease significantly in the early postoperative period on the operated hemisphere , and 1 year later hemodynamic reserve had increased to to 102 % + / - 80 % .    2.594602458567059
one year later patients with unilateral stenosis ( n = 11 ) presented with a restitution of reactivity to 65 % + / - 46 % after initial postoperative ipsilateral decrease from 51 % + / - 35 % to 48 % + / - 38 % .    2.769250867623562
patients with bilateral stenoses ( n = 9 ) demonstrated an initial decrease from 70 % + / - 60 % to 48 % + / - 21 % and a significant rise to 115 % + / - 77 % 1 year later ( p = 0 . 02 ) .    2.8430006349671
both the significant postoperative increase in the cerebral vasomotor capacity in patients with bilateral carotid stenoses registered in both hemispheres and long - term improvement in patients with unilateral stenosis underline the effectivity of carotid desobliteration in UNK prophylaxis and in cerebral blood flow increase , irrespective of the symptomatology .    2.573005303424471
chronic constipation can be divided in two large groups : slow - transit constipation , caused by pathological intestinal transit , and obstructive defecation disorder , caused by pelvic and rectal wall abnormalities .    2.1725630589876817
videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are methods used to study dynamic evacuation of the rectum .    2.3944054718237737
videodefecography also enables visual estimation of rectal evacuation .    2.3846492355130273
defecoflowmetry allows analysis of anal and rectal pressures .    2.3291859169099562
within this prospective study we utilized and compared these methods in 19 patients with slow transit and 30 patients with obstructive disease .    2.5992632211311086
in patients with slow transit , both investigations demonstrated a significantly higher defecation rate than in obstructive defecation disorder ( slow transit : defecoflowmetry 65 % , videodefecography 80 % ; obstructive defecation disorder : 50 % and 58 % ) .    2.033274561411387
also , we often found obstructive components in slow - transit constipation patients .    2.111712344942588
normal UNK or defecoflowmetry can rule out obstructive defecation disorder .    2.346968315247568
we conclude that videodefecography and defecoflowmetry are important items in the complex diagnostic regimen needed in evaluation of chronic constipation .    2.020979674599551
absence of the septum pellucidum is a rare developmental disorder of the human brain .    3.4244608406587087
previous reports focused on the association with other cerebral anomalies .    2.807749994255033
we present mri scans showing an isolated absence of the septum pellucidum .    2.263321791861904
the patient was suffering from a schizophrenic psychosis .    2.9127396582546474
mental retardation or epileptic seizures , which are often found in more complex developmental brain disorders , were not observed .    2.557815497757266
the septal area is part of the limbic system and UNK of the septum pellucidum could indicate developmental anomalies of the limbic system .    2.944844341860201
the concept of cerebral maldevelopment and the limbic system in schizophrenic psychosis is discussed .    2.272224024822127
history and clinical findings : a 61 year old man presented with newly developed tachyarrhythmia .    2.6165064234221305
investigations : the heart rate in the ecg was arrhythmic at 146 / min ; intermittently sinus rhythm was established .    2.4869891431799704
UNK echocardiography revealed a UNK mm tumour with sharp borders displacing both atria .    2.2440050398696676
the chest x - ray showed a mediastinal UNK mass in the dorsal part overlapping the right mediastinal border .    2.3893219281845393
computer tomography was unable to discriminate the atrial wall from the tumour masses ; hence the difference between an ( intra - ) cardiac tumour ( i . e .    2.1356982696482785
myxoma ) and a tumour of UNK ( mediastinal ) origin could not be established .    3.159844041698744
additional magnetic resonance tomography led to the most probable diagnosis of a UNK cyst , which spread UNK up to the ascending aorta and dorsally to the UNK region , thus displacing and shrinking the left pulmonary artery and the left atrium .    3.214739213705119
therapy : for certain exclusion of malignancy and because of displacement of other thoracic structures the patient was operated on this mediastinal mass by anterolateral thoracotomy .    2.2875168790549467
histologically a UNK , benign cyst with an inner layer of UNK and UNK as well as vascular structures in the capsule was diagnosed .    2.9583180452814988
since the operation the patient has persistent sinus rhythm without symptoms of relevant rhythm disorders .    2.296401293035997
an overview of different kinds of UNK cysts is given .    2.592214000033925
longstanding and untreated scaphoid fractures and scapholunate UNK lead to painful destruction of the wrist with carpal collapse .    2.4192222703173454
the severity of degenerative arthrosis is classified in three stages and can be treated adaequate operatively .    2.636447498985386
snac wrist ( scaphoid nonunion advanced collapse ) after failed fusion of the scaphoid and slac wrist ( scapholunate advanced collapse ) after scapholunate dissociation should be differentiated .    1.9735147801505608
the reconstruction of the scaphoid or scapholunate ligament in stage ii and iii is no reasonable option .    2.5847992714772836
motion preserving procedures such as proximal UNK UNK or midcarpal arthrodesis are preferable in this situation .    2.3884255965984242
thirty - one male patients ( average 41 years ) were treated for snac or slac wrist with midcarpal arthrodesis .    2.382627695704308
all patients were reexamined , the mean follow - up was 15 months .    2.785542916408488
grip strength was measured with the dexter - system , pain was evaluated by a visual analogue scale ( vas 0 - 100 ) .    2.52160906151789
patients ' daily activities and general quality of life were estimated with the dash - questionnaire .    2.415130084528351
pain was reduced to 50 % compared to the preoperative situation .    3.6096411182887653
grip strength improved to 60 % of the opposite side .    3.32625693436867
active range of motion reached 50 % of the contralateral wrist .    3.6234105039266433
80 % of the patients returned to their original occupation .    3.01315950412532
midcarpal fusion is a reliable procedure for treating the difficult condition of advanced carpal collapse is proper UNK of the UNK is performed .    2.703281488694525
the dash - score reflects the subjective impressions of the patients in daily life and justifies the choice of a salvage procedure preserving wrist mobility .    2.495687818152703
total wrist fusion represents the last line of defense .    2.291700398158052
stress fractures are one of the most common UNK injuries seen in athletes , accounting for up to 20 % of all injuries presented to sports medicine clinics .    2.6769214615059833
this article will discuss the key clinical findings for the majority of stress fractures encountered in a sports medicine practice .    2.35745768276653
a classification scheme will also be described that will allow the clinician to make appropriate treatment decisions based on the degree of risk for each injury .    2.480125817052189
today , enzyme therapy with proteolytic enzymes still only plays a minor role in clinical practice , partially due to the UNK that intestinal resorption of UNK is impossible .    2.55743314388842
however , there is scientific evidence of intestinal resorption and a subsequent increase in proteolytic serum activity , and placebo - controlled randomised clinical trials have demonstrated positive effects of enzyme therapy .    2.236653014087047
the documented effects include the reduction of oedema and resorption of haematoma , resulting in pain reduction and better mobility .    2.397914046756882
there are indications to use such therapies in the areas of general surgery , traumatology , plastic surgery , and dental surgery .    2.2808413121629396
a further effect is higher tissue concentration of antibiotics in combination with proteolytic enzymes .    2.6120608275769097
in gynaecological treatments , enzymes are administered in breast surgery and to reduce the side effects of obstetrical injuries .    2.5412514669086748
breast UNK is a further indication for enzyme therapy .    2.9175575915650405
further studies concerning enzyme therapy are justified because of the interesting possibilities offered by these substances and a favourable relationship between costs and benefits .    2.2123523281560864
high - frequency ventilation and inhaled nitric oxide represent - among others - two treatment options in UNK respiratory failure of neonates .    2.1063675905932664
we report the case of a term infant with UNK aspiration syndrome , who only responded favorably to inhaled nitric oxide following the initiation of high - frequency ventilation .    2.259395470939733
at an oxygenation index of 17 we started treatment with nitric oxide in order to reverse right - to - left shunting and improve oxygenation .    2.3975000300687093
how - ever the respiratory situation did not improve , the oxygenation index increased to 25 .    2.3332414063654285
after discontinuation of nitric oxide the mode of ventilation was switched to UNK with mean airway pressures of 15 mbar .    2.438622877095727
again UNK - tion was unaffected with an oxygenation index of meanwhile 31 .    2.316648095935529
at that stage of a second trial of inhaled nitric oxide was started at a concentration of 10 ppm while continuing high - frequency ventilation .    2.2731002079092995
immediately oxygenation improved significantly , the oxygenation index decreased to 9 within several minutes after UNK nitric oxide .    2.1051682577152504
this effect on oxygenation was sustained for the duration of several days during high - frequency ventilation until gradual weaning from UNK could be performed .    2.515126527844766
learning microsurgery of the middle ear requires preparations of temporal bones .    2.6400562952750537
ethical and moral restrictions in obtaining specimens make training and research with temporal bone preparations increasingly more difficult .    1.9993443697634483
due to the complex structure of the temporal bone with its communicating cavities , the UNK of facsimiles up to now has been impossible .    2.9872883800849106
rapid UNK techniques must be able to produce identical objects from an original one .    2.2590402501710054
by using ct scans of temporal bones from anatomic preparations and patients we have been able to reconstruct 3d pictures on a cad workstation .    2.09785273668049
we are now able to incorporate data in a UNK system to create an anatomic UNK of the temporal bone .    3.096828122701713
it is possible to produce a considerable number of these facsimiles from the same real object .    2.512150125669822
with this method we can produce models of human structure for medical teaching , training and research .    2.291925217261606
during the past few years the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis , the most frequent of the rheumatic inflammatory systemic diseases has improved a great deal .    3.057102344360619
the treatment strategy is based on the one hand on the so - called prognostic factors and on the other hand on the extent of the inflammatory activities , especially during the first phase .    3.176786505933931
numerous controlled studies and meta - analyses have enabled optimal application of the basic disease - modifying drugs , with regard to efficacy and side effects .    2.6211783566364115
improved knowledge of physiotherapeutic treatment , correct diet and careful observation of the patient ' s progress with the aid of questionnaires enable optimal care with regard to life quality .    2.515953342408686
intrinsic positive end - expiratory pressure ( peepi ) occurring during mechanical ventilation depends on expiratory time constants , expiratory volume and expiration time as well as on external flow resistance ( tubes , valves , etc . ) .    2.009754543705088
it is not routinely determined in mechanically ventilated patients , but it is necessary to optimize respirator settings .    2.9940699332289356
the aim of the present study was the validation of an automated peepi determination method implemented in the respirator evita ( UNK , lübeck ) in mechanically ventilated patients with acute lung failure .    2.363998237775735
the method was validated in ten sedated , UNK patients with respiratory insufficiency of different etiologies ( five with restrictive , and five with obstructive pulmonary disease ) .    2.3369782567300845
peepi was first determined with the automated method implemented in the evita ( five measurements at each end - expiratory pressure level ; peepevita ) .    2.0639125393715525
steady - state was attained between each measurement .    2.5466065160330036
these values were compared to the results obtained with end - expiratory occlusion ( external , computer - controlled valve in the inspiratory limb of the circuit ) at the respective pressure levels ( peepeeo ) .    2.4120623847061418
the average of five measurements at each peep level with each method was defined as peepi for the particular ventilatory situation .    2.153089469844642
gas flow was measured at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube with a heated UNK ( fleisch no .    2.4781146637042464
2 , fleisch , UNK , switzerland ) and a differential pressure transducer .    3.4751729047172417
tracheal pressure was determined in the same position with a further differential pressure transducer ( dr . UNK & gut , basel , switzerland ) .    2.2318418122605763
after a / d conversion , data were sampled with a frequency of 20 hz and processed on an UNK compatible pc .    2.0667613113075123
software for data collection and processing as well as for control of the occlusion valve was self - programmed .    2.816287678050196
for the statistical analysis we used the mann - whitney u - test or wilcoxon signed - ranks test ; a p value less than 0 . 05 was considered significant .    2.1871468412301507
at the given respiratory setting and without peep patients with obstructive lung disease had a higher peepi ( median : 6 . 4 cm h2o ; range : 5 . 0 - 9 . 6 cm h2o ) than those with restrictive pulmonary disease ( median : 2 . 3 cm h2o ; range : 0 . 8 - 3 . 0 cm h2o ) ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.5775661830666126
increasing external peep to 5 or 10 cm h2o significantly decreased the pressure difference between peepi and external peep ( p < 0 . 05 ) , but was unable to eliminate it completely .    2.254788818304593
there was no statistically significant difference between peepeeo and peepevita ( p = 0 . 43 ; wilcoxon signed - ranks tests ) .    2.3061746661191966
regression analysis showed a highly significant correlation between peepeeo and peepevita values ( r = 0 . UNK , p < 0 . 001 ; y = 1 . UNK - 0 . 18 ) .    2.7917222205602754
peepi occurs during ventilation in patients with obstructive and restrictive lung disease .    2.9428481239367095
the difference between external end - expiratory pressure and peepi decreases with increasing external peep .    2.365655701912583
however , peepi may increase with increasing external peep in some instances .    2.2712954159230496
the reason for this may be that the peepi determined at the proximal end of the endotracheal tube represents only a mean value of different peepi values of various lung regions .    2.325642914019184
increasing external peep only partially alters this mean value due to an effect on peepi values lower than external peep .    2.302712841281962
the peepi values measured by the evita respirator compared with classical end - expiratory occlusion with an external valve were nearly identical .    2.1274617584579056
unfortunately , peepi measurement of the evita can only    2.9823041296369195
we report on the case of a 70 - year - old caucasian woman with a large linear sebaceous naevus with multifocal intralesional basaliomas and a UNK of the left eye .    2.9554744965465702
this rare finding has been preserved because of the special history of the patient .    2.9646040608055797
the naevus spread on the left side from parietal to UNK , UNK and sternal .    3.206376678634622
because of the patient ' s cardio - pulmonary insufficiency we excised the basaliomas under local anaesthesia .    2.4483787154101257
we also made a partial UNK excision of the left - sided parietal parts of the naevus .    3.161490014592895
we describe an hla - b27 positive patient in whom posttraumatic pyogenic UNK led to complete unilateral UNK joint ankylosis in the absence of any signs indicative of hla - b27 associated UNK .    2.121164130485923
ondansetron , a selective 5 - UNK receptor antagonist , has recently been shown , in a dose of 8 mg , to be superior to 1 . 25 mg droperidol in preventing postoperative vomiting .    2.6375071112182464
there are indications that a dose of 4 mg of ondansetron may be just as effective in reducing postoperative nausea and vomiting as a dose of 8 mg [ 16 ] .    2.13889641348538
following institutional approval , 40 asa physical status i and ii women scheduled for minor gynaecological surgery gave informed consent to participate in this randomized , double - blind comparative study .    2.077655869770039
five minutes before induction of general anaesthesia , 20 patients received a single intravenous ( iv ) dose of 4 mg of ondansetron and the remaining 20 received 1 . 25 mg droperidol iv .    2.3098679225717555
anaesthesia was induced with 2 . 1 - 4 mg / kg of thiopental and 0 . 1 mg of alfentanil iv and maintained with 65 % nitrous oxide and 1 . 5 % - 3 % enflurane in oxygen .    3.0758762909049717
on pain stimuli another 0 . 2 - 0 . 4 mg of alfentanil was given .    3.286939437964339
total effective antiemetic response was defined as the absence of nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively .    2.9103484575880993
the incidence of nausea , vomiting and the number of patients showing total antiemetic response as well as the incidence of adverse effects were compared with the chi2 test and p < 0 . 05 was considered significant .    2.865244953043885
patients were similar with respect to age , height , body weight and total anaesthetic agents received .    2.477011397540005
duration of anaesthesia and the time until awakening was not significantly different among groups .    2.934949993602217
postoperatively 7 out of 20 patients given 4 mg of ondansetron and 3 out of 20 patients with droperidol UNK ( n . s . ) .    2.4383265730319725
the incidence of nausea was 11 out of 20 in the ondansetron group , and 4 out of 20 in the droperidol group ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.4921137584713806
sixteen patients in the droperidol group and 8 patients in the ondansetron group showed a total effective antiemetic response ( p < 0 . 05 ) .    2.629563727973873
postoperative sedation and well - being scores did not differ significantly among groups .    2.731558466775883
our results show that for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting 4 mg of ondansetron was inferior to 1 . 25 mg of droperidol .    2.5925340455870334
the drugs were given intravenously prior to general anaesthesia for minor gynaecological surgery with nitrous oxide and enflurane in oxygen supplemented with small boluses of alfentanil .    2.0567895679262143
a 66 - year - old woman died of internal bleeding and pulmonary fat embolism following repeated massive UNK from a UNK UNK and an electric UNK .    2.633054417544468
the initial autopsy diagnosis was natural death .    2.391258350106961
a second UNK on the UNK body and an intensive criminal investigation revealed a long history of maltreatment by two sisters with whom the victim lived .    2.3298844866412285
the maltreatment occurred during UNK with the UNK purpose of UNK the victim of her UNK by UNK .    3.1579541864453176
the UNK and the victim UNK to the same UNK UNK .    3.581885633794044
the elder of the two sisters had been previously UNK of a fatal UNK maltreatment of a 17 - year - old girl .    2.6701933458030696
definition of the problem : the article discusses the ways in which sociological analyses can contribute to the problem of a just allocation of scarce donor organs .    2.210271953660679
according to the ao classification there were 3 b - and 27 c - fractures , most of them UNK viii fractures .    2.4126212954639903
of 30 fractures 23 showed additional lesions which could only be diagnosed under arthroscopic view .    2.4654190299773395
in particular , 12 partial or complete tears of the UNK ligaments were found .    2.968270335844758
of 25 fractures 23 which were treated at least 12 months previously could be followed up radiologically and clinically .    2.38186191003659
x - rays included postero anterior and lateral views to evaluate the radial angles and the radial length and stress tests to check for instability , especially of the scapholunate ligaments .    2.3095863377026196
clinical examination included range of motion and objective grip strength measured with a jamar ( UNK ) tester .    2.6119317148144314
each test was performed on both wrists for comparison .    2.8231962419844656
subjective data included pain and function for daily activities .    2.310951680986297
data were evaluated by the jakim and the cooney scoring system and the demerit point system by gartland and werley as modified by sarmiento et al .    1.8665559605169602
about 70 % of our patients showed an excellent or good result ; about 15 % had a poor result .    2.629446287353016
however , we must mention that we were not able to reduce one c3 - fracture under arthroscopic view and had to switch to a semi - open procedure with additional external UNK .    2.163166242738723
arthroscopically assisted treatment of distal intraarticular fractures is not only useful to detect and manage additional carpal lesions , but seems to give good midterm results as well .    2.1690706194889704
antitachycardia pacing techniques ( atp ) have proved useful for termination of ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) .    2.0801466674394873
however , little is known about the efficacy and safety off atp during long - term follow - up in a larger study population .    2.521388828062637
we analyzed the data of 80 icd patients ( pts ) with spontaneous UNK vt , mean age 59 + / - 12 years , the mean follow - up was 26 + / - 17 months .    3.0189528298010964
UNK episodes of ventricular tachycardia ( cycle length UNK + / - 51 ms , 240 - 520 ms ) occurred in 64 / 80 pts ( 80 % ) , overall efficacy of atp was 89 . 9 % , acceleration occurred in 4 . 1 % of UNK .    2.561263107277034
success of atp did not correlate with positive atp testing on induced arrhythmias , UNK , nyha class or aneurysm .    2.4124991627767405
neither underlying heart disease nor antiarrhythmic medication had an impact on the atp success rate .    2.3608368565791404
atp efficacy was linked significantly to short vt cycle length ( UNK , 240 - 300 ms , p < 0 . 01 ) and long coupling intervals ( 91 - 97 % ) , p < 0 . 01 ) .    2.335239338834286
acceleration occurred in 32 % of pts and in 4 . 1 % of vt episodes ; it was also dependent on short vt cycle length ( < 300 ms vs > 300 ms , p < 0 . 04 ) and short coupling intervals ( < 81 % vs > = 81 % , p < = 0 . 01 ) .    2.3422919598080894
methodological work was performed in the field of magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) and spectroscopy ( UNK ) in order to develop suitable tools for non - invasive characterization of hematopoetic bone marrow .    3.15533602238154
the methods were applied for the assessment of normal values in healthy persons and to examine patients with generalized hematological diseases or to monitor effects of therapies influencing the composition of bone marrow .    2.3617086324702763
drugs and infections ( especially hepatitis b and c ) are well - known provocation factors .    2.590896888041017
after an infection with scabies a 13 year old boy developed a generalized lichen planus including bullous lesions .    2.2778478157395066
for the first time scabies is presented as a trigger for lichen planus .    2.3754465432589624
in childhood , lichen planus is characterized by atypical clinical features and sometimes a severe course .    2.7160265795660066
introduction : increasing demands on quality assurance und medical performance documentation require an UNK and evaluable documentation in the outpatients ' department .    2.0478136445832056

presentation of the documentation flow and its transfer into other contexts .    2.346988154294274
discussion : pure text - based clinical results do not allow sufficient UNK for quality assurance and medical performance documentation .    2.204084597899167
however , a computer - based and immediate documentation in outpatients ' departments should not mean a significantly increased workload for physicians .    2.1427545242109542
hydromorphone is a UNK receptor agonist opioid .    3.0933792320120155
according to who recommendations , hydromorphone is to be classified in step iii of pain therapy .    2.3816064767211476
an oral formulation with a prolonged duration of action of 12 hours has been evaluated only recently .    2.4152393107075985
the controlled release capsule is especially suited for the regular twice a day administration in cases of severe and persistent pain .    2.539426071282047
the oral formulation of hydromorphone increases the number of opioid analgesics available for pain therapy in step iii .    2.5300924769917725
hydromorphone is recommended when morphine fails to produce sufficient pain relief ( despite increase of doses ) or causes intolerable side effects ( despite treatment of symptoms ) .    1.9777391700531066
in principle , no differences in efficacy of morphine and hydromorphone are to be expected .    2.613542204096696
the dose of hydromorphone equivalent to 2 times 30 mg controlled release morphine is about 2 times 4 mg .    2.065355749742601
the values for the absorption , bioavailability and maximum plasma concentration after the administration of controlled release hydromorphone every 12 hours - of three times the dose - are equivalent to those of an immediate release tablet given every 4 hours .    2.1128053554476045
in several open label and controlled studies , hydromorphone proved to be of good efficacy in the treatment of acute and persistent pain , especially in patients with severe cancer pain .    3.1459547808113384
with regard to the incidence of side effects , no significant differences between morphine and hydromorphone could be established .    3.3657301640378137
in general , the side effects of hydromorphone are typical for opioid analgesics .    2.6672133919395473
in 63 patients , 82 elevations of the maxillary sinus were performed .    2.2628824454410736
as augmentation , materials autografts from the iliac crest ( combined with alveolar ridge augmentations in 16 sinus UNK ) were transplanted in 39 cases and osteoinductive , allogeneic bone powder ( aaa bone ( autolyzed , antigen - extracted , allogeneic bone ) : n = 8 , UNK ( demineralized freeze - dried bone allograft ) and / or UNK ( demineralized bone matrix gel ) : n = 35 ) were used in 43 cases .    2.1278882712026257
some 4 - 6 months after implantation , osteoinductive , allogeneic ( demineralized ) bone implants showed radio - opaque areas as an equivalent of bone formation .    2.3175132859984133
histological examinations revealed that osteoinductive implants were completely transformed into patients ' own bone tissue .    2.109171360399517
the average augmentation height after autograft transplantations was 14 ( + / - 3 ) mm in comparison with 9 ( + / - 3 ) mm after allograft implantations .    2.488128428924201
histologically as well as radiologically no differences of the bone quality could be determined between the two augmentation materials .    3.231421978101677
endoscopic controls showed , in both groups , UNK mucous membranes .    2.771937933094134
on an average 2 endosseous implants ( bone UNK or UNK - screw implants ) were inserted into the UNK maxillary sinus UNK in both groups .    2.6573432202437157
no osseointegration was achieved in 4 out of 67 dental implants when bone autografts were used and in 2 out of 74 dental implants of the allogeneic bone group .    2.2113070070216208
patients with bone autografts suffered from postoperative complaints on an average of 19 ( + / - 9 ) days ( without consideration of 2 patients with postoperative complaints persisting for more than 90 days ) .    2.5128074394100706
the average postoperative complaints of recipients of allogeneic bone implants continued for 3 ( + / - 5 ) days .    2.4787864256792775
the 13 patients who underwent an ambulant sinus lift procedure with allogeneic bone powder were already symptom - free several hours after the operation .    2.3376881543398658
under critical consideration of all investigated parameters , osteoinductive bone implants are preferable to iliac bone autografts for maxillary sinus augmentations in those cases in which no additional alveolar ridge augmentation is required .    1.9646895034763532
we describe a patient with a primary renal plasmacytoma .    3.057914736024002
in the literature available , only six clinical cases have been reported .    2.5900252514076416
a 64 - year - old patient is presented who had the clinical signs of a renal cell carcinoma .    3.338619124292309
histological examination after nephrectomy , however , revealed a plasmacytoma .    2.904277592780536
based on this case , we discuss how one should proceed in this disease .    2.567796703034585
primary renal plasmacytoma can be tentatively diagnosed preoperatively only in the presence of paraproteinemia or UNK - jones proteinuria , as it cannot be distinguished from other renal tumors by imaging procedures .    2.517354720385086
postoperatively , further staging procedures must rule out bone involvement ( solitary myeloma or multiple myeloma ) .    1.957772050664495
nephrectomy is required in patients with plasmacytoma only if renal complications occur .    2.9152717903751513
dissection of the ascending aorta ( type a ) following later after aortic valve replacement has been described with increasing frequency .    2.7474785217381825
this study analyzes the role of aortic valve replacement for the evolution of late dissection .    2.8336751248082024
indications for surgery were unstable fracture , displaced fracture through the acetabular dome and fracture with intra - acetabular fracture fragments .    2.036973609625607
there were 37 . 3 % a - fractures , 49 . 7 % b - fractures , and 13 % c fractures according to the ao classification .    2.8822319424737985
in 16 . 4 % of fractures there were primary neurological deficits .    2.7541278552721473
patients were treated operatively after an average of 5 . 0 days .    3.7702132752056663
the kocher - langenbeck approach was used in 56 . 9 % of cases , the UNK - inguinal approach in 27 . 1 % and the extended iliofemoral approach in 4 % .    3.3163008956596247
in 7 . 1 % of patients , a primary total hip endoprosthesis was implanted .    3.188425795595771
there was no intra - UNK perioperative mortality .    2.494780314627162
the average hospital stay was 26 . 1 days .    2.8914027648355822
in 7 . 1 % of patients , we noted secondary neurological problems .    3.260174747793936
deep infections were present in 1 . 3 % .    3.4652352408414395
in 11 . 1 % of patients a second operative procedure was necessary .    3.3560791573650004
we were able to review 175 patients after an average of 2 years .    2.69328868784129
signs of arthrosis and periarticular ossification were noted on the x - rays : walking distance , hip mobility and pain intensity were asked about and recorded after the clinical examination .    2.263330354470483
in 76 % of patients an excellent or good result on the merle - d ' aubigne scale was obtained .    2.570413050515375
t - fractures and posterior wall fractures were followed by the worst results .    2.6055588939525456
during this 9 - year period , changes have been made to the preoperative radiological examination carried out , the choice of operative approach and our policy on prevention of thrombosis prophylaxis and postoperative ossification .    2.399298693040695
after thorough preoperative diagnosis and with a meticulous operative technique , it is possible to stabilise the vast majority of acetabular fractures through the three classical approaches .    2.4920433695781945
because the fractures are relatively rare , their diagnosis complex and their surgical treatment difficult , specific training is essential for every acetabular surgeon .    2.1586333473536934
diagnostic pitfalls exist when benign salivary gland diseases are UNK classified as malignant , with consequences for treatment and prognosis .    2.1997221029642486
examples are necrotizing UNK , UNK warthin tumour and sclerosing polycystic UNK .    2.6854523519743547
the proper diagnosis is of eminent importance to distinguish cases of primary tumours that have developed in salivary glands or their lymph nodes from cases of UNK tumours with metastases in these glands or their nodes .    2.195514167432513
in these cases clinical data and additional immunocytochemical methods are necessary to clarify the exact diagnosis , especially when the primary salivary gland tumours have a structure largely identical to the metastases ( e . g .    2.293807679583884
nasopharyngeal or cervical chordomas can be mistaken for pleomorphic adenoma or mucinous adenocarcinoma .    2.1132577718478793
the initial stage of malignant UNK lymphomas in association with sjögren ' s syndrome demands identification of clonal rearrangement for therapeutic UNK .    2.1978221018722497
the diagnostic criteria for proper classification are analysed in detail .    2.4150405210825987
a 59 - year - old male patient was UNK operated on because of a pituitary adenoma with UNK .    2.6641570205703364
a second operation and x - ray therapy followed a half year later due to recurrent tumor .    2.3593480225755017
both neoplasmas were classified as UNK UNK prolactin cell adenomas .    2.7730833897149822
immunohistochemical studies revealed strong immunoreactivity for prolactin and fsh in the tumor cells of both the pituitary adenoma and the recurrent tumor .    2.3931112033370985
two years later the prolactin plasma levels were extremely elevated .    2.3727155657683507
a tumor in the liver was identified .    3.419601380067307
biopsy revealed a solid endocrine tumor containing prolactin by immunohistology .    2.199984461214741
due to structural and immunohistological similarities this tumor could be identified as a metastasis of the pituitary tumor .    2.473680755312149
after 5 months of therapy the patient died from thrombembolism .    2.9174500902899254
post - mortem studies confirmed the diagnosis of a metastasizing prolactin - secreting pituitary carcinoma .    2.632915743514822
only six similar cases have been reported in the literature .    2.588114545190815
our case report confirms the experience with 35 definite pituitary carcinomas UNK in the current literature : malignant pituitary tumors develop after pituitary surgery and can be identified not from the pituitary tumor , but only from its metastases .    2.40249607359201
paraneoplastic markers in tumor patients may occur at various stages of the disease .    2.4393299814923646
while some disorders almost invariably UNK an underlying malignancy ( UNK marker ) , most only occasionally do so ( facultative marker ) .    1.885597669662744
the association of bullous pemphigoid with malignancy is controversial .    2.4823535328611737
there are only a few reports of bullous pemphigoid associated with a renal cell carcinoma .    3.072940705258663
we diagnosed a renal cell carcinoma in a 74 year old female patient , admitted to the hospital because of bullous pemphigoid .    2.736815879337656
multiple metastases were found in her lymph nodes , liver , lung and skeleton .    2.9502805212924406
the patient died eleven weeks after the first symptoms of bullous pemphigoid appeared .    2.8221714219675405
acute compartment syndrome of the thigh has been infrequently reported in the literature .    2.313255397143719
closed femoral fractures and blunt soft tissue trauma are the main causes of this injury .    2.6537747431163834
the multiple injured patient in this case report developed a compartment syndrome of the thigh after intramedullary nailing of a comminuted fracture of the femur .    2.646703542042194
fasciotomy was performed two days after surgery because of UNK swelling of the thigh in the ventilated and sedated patient .    2.618027420135533
sciatic and femoral nerve palsy was recognized after extubation of the patient nine days after the injury .    2.6483688201666924
during the following weeks the paresis of the femoral nerve recovered but neither motor nor sensory function of the sciatic nerve could be demonstrated .    2.4681058711399744
therefore an operative revision of the sciatic nerve was performed eighteen weeks after trauma .    2.2841023060556895
no direct nerve injury could be detected but there were adhesions around the nerve as a sign of compression neuropathy caused by the compartment syndrome .    2.4082780921157356
the tibial component of the sciatic nerve showed a complete recovery within the next months but there was a persisting peroneal nerve palsy .    2.663336450070247
conclusion : early clinical symptoms of a compartment syndrome like pain , paresthesia and paresis can not be ascertained in a ventilated and sedated patient .    2.116175631809838
tense swelling of the muscles is often the only detectable sign .    2.7342544707353102
frequent measurements of compartment pressure should be done in these patients .    2.6512991208400667
we suggest early decompressive fasciotomy because the morbidity caused by fasciotomy in a borderline compartment syndrome is far UNK by the morbidity that UNK an undiagnosed untreated compartment syndrome with possible nerve palsy .    2.0276405842293213
aim : the long - term effect of UNK with cystic fibrosis was examined .    2.976254860420264
teeth are most important for the identification of unknown cadavers .    3.0832734097302725
the police UNK difficult cases of unidentified bodies in dental print media .    2.135947821584679
using their records such as x - rays or documented dental work dentists can often recognize an unknown person and thus contribute to the identification .    2.231389988232203
to evaluate the efficency of this procedure 177 cases published between 1975 and 1995 were examined .    2.3554949287319396
only 3 % of the examined cases could be identified due to a reaction to publishing in the dental print media .    2.866857972519272
to improve the presentation of identification cases in the dental print media 500 dentists were asked to take part in a survey .    2.4018984375516106
new technological possibilities such as digital x - UNK or online data transfer could open new ways for forensic identification .    2.059487072850285
in a fatality after oral intake of a large amount of an insecticide spray consisting of propoxur , tetramethrine and the UNK isopropanol and benzyl alcohol , a coagulation UNK fixation of the oesophagus and stomach were the main morphological findings .    2.1531381907551195
the concentrations determined by hplc and gc / ms in femoral blood , liver , kidney , vitreous UNK and liquor were in the comatose lethal range for propoxur ( < 0 . 3 - 18 µg / g ) , whereas UNK ( up to 0 . 1 µg / g ) was almost completely UNK .    2.5557737018525915
the propoxur decomposition product o - isopropoxyphenol ( 2 . 8 - 56 µg / g ) , benzyl alcohol ( 18 - 58 µg / g ) and its UNK product benzoic acid ( 85 - 140 µg / g ) , isopropanol ( 0 . 45 - 1 . 1 mg / g ) and acetone ( 0 . 01 - 0 . 03 mg / g ) were also found .    2.6225400468691182
on the other hand , the concentrations in heart blood and lung tissue were up to 30 times higher .    2.104808672704741
as a reason for these immense concentration differences an UNK aspiration of the highly concentrated liquid stomach content after vomiting immediately before death is discussed .    1.8944250954950572
the extent of the UNK of propoxur to o - isopropoxyphenol and of benzyl alcohol to benzoic acid , which is assumed to proceed mainly postmortem , was quite different in the materials investigated and was almost complete in the liver .    2.396685918981859
the intoxication by the acetylcholine esterase inhibitor propoxur in combination with the neurotoxic effect of tetramethrine was determined as the cause of death .    2.277371945332816
background : despite the fact that deep lamellar keratoplasty ( dlkp ) is less invasive than to penetrating keratoplasty ( UNK ) , this procedure is rarely performed .    2.574308063512891
we therefore investigated whether or not the dlkp technique we employed can achieve stable improvement of visual acuity .    2.1624322147524455
palmoplantar keratodermia ( ppk ) varians and ppk punctata are considered different entities within the group of hereditary palmoplantar UNK .    2.0749477804434875
keratosis punctata of the palmar creases constitutes a localized form of keratodermia palmoplantaris punctata .    2.087923427296795
we describe a 31 - year - old man exhibiting both UNK and papular keratoses on the UNK , as well as small punctate keratoses confined to the palmar creases .    2.793390997031757
in view of the co - occurrence of these two types of ppk , the question arises whether keratosis palmoplantaris of the varians and the punctate type represent distinct entities or represent variable manifestations of the same gene defect .    2.147544742487394
the author gives a synoptic view on the paths and routes of emigration the jewish and / or political reasons UNK psychoanalysts had to take in order to escape national UNK germany .    2.172915351072258
with reference to current studies on emigration , which for germany differentiates three distinctive phases of emigration between 1933 and UNK , the immigration policy especially of the united states and great britain and its impact on the concrete circumstances and modalities for the emigration of the particular professional group of psychoanalysts is described and discussed .    2.2158464053147036
in this context , the major importance of the solidarity and help the UNK were granted by the international psychoanalytic community and performed in spite of partially major theoretical differences and institutional UNK is emphasized .    2.172246647900702
acute suppurative UNK is very rare in childhood .    2.7507373937030737
we describe the clinical signs and the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures of thyroid abscesses in children , and add 2 own cases of this rare disease .    2.5953790824526295
in the first case , diagnosis of piriform sinus fistula was made finally after repeated drainage for recurrent abscesses of the left thyroid .    2.427956869294938
operative excision of the fistula was performed and the child is doing well since then .    2.8886064606189423
in the second case , a left sided thyroid abscess was treated by incision and drainage only .    2.3047194597199567
seven years later , no recurrent abscess occurred in this child .    2.4509474947837484
in conclusion , especially in left sided and recurrent thyroid abscesses the patients should be examined for a piriform sinus fistula as a route of infection .    2.2728123780810567
if present , complete removal of the fistula is essential for permanent cure .    2.9614745870467507
the importance of spiral - ct is clinically accepted for diagnosing spreading disease and for making a decision about the therapy strategy for head and neck tumors .    1.9232997912188778
its importance for follow - up after radiotherapy was examined in 26 patients with irradiated laryngeal tumors .    2.2420030852694044
using spiral - ct multiple signs of alterations ( n = 98 ) can be diagnosed , which are not only important for tumour relapse , but also for assessment .    2.450034113968651
spiral - ct offers the possibility of achieviny various additional information about the larynx that cannot be obtained with laryngoscopy .    2.3016748204033717
in follow - up examinations after radiation , laryngoscopy and spiral - ct are recommended as an integrated neck examination using the breath - holding technique ( separately reconstructed ) and also as functional spiral - ct of the vocal cords in " i " - phonation .    1.7606545264012963
UNK in scotland was the first to describe the administration of ether for analgesia in painful deliveries .    2.6493752822962473
only a few days later e . c . j .    2.8305905889062193
von siebold ( * UNK in würzburg - \ UNK in göttingen ) performed the first systematic study on ether in obstetrics .    1.887720197839126
following a preceding evaluation of the action of ether on non - pregnant woman and on pregnant women not in active labour , he administered ether for analgesia during the second stage of labour in eight parturients .    2.124510011493716
the first administration was on february UNK 1847 .    2.274576863471059
while he was satisfied with the good analgesia without sequelae of the new - born , he was discouraged by the termination of uterine contractions observed in all his patients .    2.128181414800077
he concluded that ether was not a useful substance for analgesia during vaginal delivery , since it disturbed the natural course of labour .    2.1587668105108824
on the other hand , von siebold was very UNK with the administration of ether for operative obstetric procedures such as forceps deliveries or placental retention .    2.2218757347217837
background : mode switching aims to maintain a ventricular rhythm that UNK metabolic needs during both sinus rhythm and atrial tachyarrhythmias .    2.1120541873442042
this allows patients with atrial arrhythmias to benefit from av synchronous pacing modes . aim and method : beat - to - beat mode switching in UNK and clarity pacemakers is designed to maintain a relatively stable ventricular rhythm , ensuring consistent ventricular filling patterns .    2.0633870177749256
atrial tachyarrhythmia detection is based on a continuous analysis of the atrial rhythm .    3.5397979968633417
a too rapid increase of the atrial rate with a beat - to - beat acceleration > 15 bpm is considered to be an atrial tachyarrhythmia .    2.6294346758498235
mode switching occurs on detection of the first premature atrial event : atrial tracking is stopped and the ventricular rate is determined by the rate indicated by the dual sensor ( qt interval and activity ) .    2.251257507222707
atrial pacing UNK av synchrony immediately after cessation of the atrial tachyarrhythmia , effectively avoiding retrograde conduction .    2.154739175908482
dedicated diagnostic functions allow one to monitor the incidence of atrial tachyarrhythmias and to study atrial and ventricular events just prior to its onset .    2.5868889336161716
both the mode switching and rate responsive function are fully automatic , rendering follow - up procedures easy and less time - consuming .    2.250390288729365
conclusion : reliable detection of all atrial events is essential to guarantee appropriate mode switching .    2.289064054779516
introduction : mediastinal diseases are mostly diagnosed by ct and mri .    2.5012783773319636
the applicability of ultrasound is limited by the surrounding air - and bone - containing thorax , which permits only restricted echo windows .    2.1577903264264626
transesophageal endoscopic ultrasonography UNK this problem and ensures visualization of parts of the mediastinum .    2.468423178660095
blood glucose alterations prior to cerebral ischaemia are associated with poor neurologic outcome , possibly due to extensive lactic acidosis or energy failure .    2.208363814772219
cerebral effects of hyper - or hypoglycaemia during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) are less well known .    2.1529242257747936
in addition , little information is available concerning cardiac effects of blood glucose alterations .    2.273366415476894
the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of pre - cardiac - arrest hypo - or hyperglycaemia compared to normoglycaemia upon haemodynamics , cerebral blood flow ( cbf ) and metabolism ( cmro2 ) , and regional cardiac blood flow during cpr subsequent to 3 min of cardiac and respiratory arrest and after restoration of spontaneous circulation .    2.0802256995938317
after approval by the state animal investigation committee , 29 mechanically ventilated , anaesthetised pigs were instrumented for haemodynamic monitoring and blood flow determination by the radiolabeled UNK technique .    1.8571285742974997
the animals were randomly assigned to one of three groups : in group i ( n = 9 ) blood glucose was not manipulated ; in group ii ( n = 10 ) blood glucose was increased by slow infusion of 40 % glucose to 319 + / - 13 mg / dl ; in group iii ( n = 10 ) blood glucose was lowered by careful titration with insulin to 34 + / - 2 mg / dl .    2.6477870723042822
after 3 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation and respiratory arrest , cpr ( chest UNK / ventilator ( UNK ) and epinephrine infusion ) was UNK and continued for 8 min .    2.4152782394344685
thereafter , defibrillation was attempted , and if successful , the animals were observed for another 240 min .    2.261259744552336
cerebral perfusion pressure ( cpp ) , cbf , cmro2 , coronary perfusion pressure ( corpp ) , and regional cardiac blood flow were determined at control , after 3 min of cpr , and at 10 , 30 , and 240 min post - cpr .    2.3275142539116804
in group i , 4 / 9 animals ( 44 % ) could be successfully resuscitated ; in group ii 4 / 10 ( 40 % ) ; and in group iii 0 / 10 ( 0 % ) .    2.6795839197627846
prior to cardiac arrest , mean arterial pressure , cpp , and corpp in group iii were significantly lower compared to groups i and ii .    2.4103795389300493
in group i , cpp during cpr was 26 + / - 6 mmhg ; cbf 31 + / - 9 ml / min / 100 g cmro2 3 . 8 + / - 1 . 2 ml / min / 100 g ; corpp 18 + / - 5 mmhg ; and left ventricular ( lv ) flow 35 + / - 15 ml / min / 100 g . in group ii : cpp = 21 + / - 5 ; cbf 21 + / - 7 ; cmro2 1 . 8 + / - 0 . 8 ; corpp 16 + / - 6 ; and lv flow 22 + / - 9 ; and in group iii : cpp 15 + / - 3 ; cbf 11 + / - 8 ; cmro2 1 . 5 + / - 1 . 1 ; corpp 4 + / - 2 ; and lv flow 19 + / - 10 .    2.8219320063939652
during the 240 - min post - resuscitation period , there were no differences in cbf , cmro2 , or lv flow between groups i and ii .    2.217696634582223
hypoglycaemia prior to cardiac arrest appears to be predictive for a poor cardiac outcome , whereas hyperglycaemia does not impair UNK compared to normoglycaemia .    2.3615540654770073
in addition , hyperglycaemia did not affect lv flow , cbf , or cmro2 .    2.0628640191691967
however , it has to be kept in mind that haemodynamics and organ blood flow do not permit conclusions with respect to functional neurologic recovery or histopathologic damage to the brain , which is very likely to be associated with hyperglycaemia .    2.7587553693286786
abstract we present an algorithm for the rational diagnosis of UNK UNK type i ( ga1 ) .    3.049260501926564
normal urinary organic acids in patients with non - specific clinical features and normal results of brain imaging render the diagnosis highly unlikely , and no further investigations are required .    2.7486401133588347
in other patients , the diagnostic strategy depends on the individual clinical , neuroradiological and biochemical findings .    2.9948596335051154
UNK enzyme analysis should be reserved for patients in whom ga1 is very likely .    2.47238868581564
this article gives a brief review of the history of spinal surgery from the end of the nineteenth century up to our own time .    2.5649424603874995
malignant lymphomas , originating from peripheral t or nk cells , are rare tumours in europe and account for less than 10 % of all malignant lymphomas .    2.6542764900020814
in this review , the salient features of the more frequently occurring entities derived from t or nk cells will be presented .    2.189713802638346
the tumor cells consistently express cd56 , UNK and the UNK molecules encoded by the epstein - barr virus .    2.9288356810656726
clonal t cell receptor gene rearrangements are often absent indicating , in the majority of cases , a UNK of these tumors from nk cells .    3.0028194985177317
UNK - type intestinal t - cell lymphomas often arise in patients with celiac disease and have a dismal prognosis .    2.855224158548127
the tumour cells express t cell antigens , UNK and cytotoxic molecules , but are negative for cd4 .    2.5516255777839287
recently , an early purely intraepithelial form of this tumour was identified .    2.459936562958579
histologically these cases resemble celiac disease , however the intraepithelial lymphocytes often exhibit an abnormal immunophenotype with absent cd8 and t - cell - receptor protein expression , and , they are clonal by molecular analysis .    2.1267848302423746
clinically , the patients suffer from refractory UNK or ulcerative UNK .    2.5006343834810725
the prognosis is bad with the patients often dying from malnutrition or an invasive tumour - forming t - cell lymphoma .    2.3450701573391326
angioimmunoblastic t - cell lymphoma is defined by characteristic morphological findings ( atypical lymphoid cells in part with pale UNK , arborizing high endothelial venules and large UNK - UNK ) as well as clinical features ( systemic symptoms , signs of a UNK immune response ) .    2.4862822567005747
peripheral t - cell lymphomas , that do not fit into a distinct entity , are classified in the real and the new who classifications as peripheral t - cell lymphomas UNK .    2.3233770869678323
these display a broad morphological spectrum ( including the t - cell lymphomas of different cell sizes , UNK ' s lymphoma and t - zone lymphoma of the kiel - classification ) and in general are clinically aggressive .    2.4798404818477087
causes and courses of the diseases are subjected to a change of an increasing life expectancy on the one hand and technically highly developed medicine on the other hand .    2.3371499035811016
since a growing number of elderly people is denying intensive medical interventions which serve the purpose of keeping them alive despite severe diseases , the problem of euthanasia imposes direct questions .    2.226572287835601
a central role is played by the active - passive difference and its UNK UNK .    2.3903360882513347
the difficulties of this difference are discussed below on the applicable level of ethical discussions .    2.0521884163768043
at the same time , knowledge of the danger is being made aware that in a maximal therapeutical orientated medical care system the desire for euthanasia may become identical with the reverse side of this care system .    2.1555663866821053
isolated severe head trauma ( sht ) or sht in combination with multiple injuries are important factors for the prognosis of morbidity and mortality in patients suffering from the consequences of accidents .    2.7639182909918643
the prognosis mainly depends on the presence of primary mechanic brain injury and the development of secondary brain damage .    2.986086205225816
causes for the development of secondary brain damage are the intracranial space demand after traumatic injury and edema formation which may result in UNK , as well as inflammatory processes .    2.864006081646398
both isolated sht and polytrauma with or without brain damage may result in a systemic inflammatory response syndrome ( sirs ) due to the synthesis of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators which may cause a single or multiple organ failure ( mof ) .    2.553756582643569
often the organism is able to survive isolated traumatic injuries and functional disturbances , but in combination or UNK they may be lethal .    2.457234823890856
the hypermetabolism after sht is often regarded as an interaction between the central nervous system and the whole organism by the activation of the neuroendocrine axis .    2.7367958406593913
in contrast to the consequences of sht for the whole organism , multiple injuries after polytrauma may affect brain functions , such as the shock dependent disturbance of the brain perfusion accompanied by brain hypoxia which may lead to an aggravated prognosis .    2.334786761355616
moreover , coagulation , metabolism and fracture healing are influenced by the onset of sirs as well .    2.5833957742967377
our knowledge about the bidirectional inflammatory interaction between brain and whole organism is still limited .    2.34556676635909
this article tries to summarize some important aspects on this topic .    2.1560800538934815
background : chronic cough and thoracic pain , commonly caused by upper airway infections , are frequently seen symptoms in pediatrics .    2.0867700542590137
these " benign " symptoms are very seldom caused by malignant disorders .    2.1733407502136424
methods : in two patients ( male , age 41 / 12 and 43 / 12 years ) chronic cough and thoracic pain were due to a malignant pulmonary neoplasm ( pleuropulmonary blastoma ) .    2.2330105958521154
results : pleuropulmonary blastoma is a rare malignant primary pulmonary neoplasm in childhood with a poor prognosis .    2.3507186961415285
an incomplete resection was performed in both cases .    3.6284443198724525
both patients received postoperative radiotherapy and combination chemotherapy .    2.479010525003043
one boy died , the other one is alive and well more than 6 years after diagnosis without evidence of disease .    2.59614832360443
conclusion : our findings indicate that even after incomplete resection subsequent multimodal therapy ( adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy ) can provide a long term remission .    2.0826334847886794
in 12 patients with systemic sclerosis the influence of hypnosis and autogenic training on the acral blood circulation and the coping with the disease was investigated in a pilot study .    2.5809133630104375
in the first step significant increases in the skin temperature of the fingers ( mean + / - sd : 3 . 9 + / - 1 . 2 °c ) could be found after relaxation hypnosis .    2.9878502379133125
in the second step six patients ( study group ) gained experience with autogenic training .    2.18072039419942
the other six patients served as control group .    2.3094223925469257
in the study group , the skin temperature of the fingers ( short - term effect ) was significantly higher than in the control group ( 1 . 9 + / - 1 . 0 °c ) .    3.333963095386779
long - term effects of the autogenic training ( mean acral UNK time , duration and course of the raynaud attacks , acral lesions of the hands , psychosomatic status of complaints , type of relation to the disease as precondition for coping with the disease ) were not found within the relatively short follow - up period of 4 months .    2.6545381582919823
two patients , however , reported that they could shorten the duration of raynaud attacks by autogenic training .    2.6824024834789393
in our patients UNK and an increased score of multiple psychosomatic complaints were registered at the UNK .    2.7666495875176498
as far as the type of relation to the disease is concerned , the patients could be assessed as almost adapted .    3.11568120546746
hypnosis and autogenic training can be recommended as complementary therapy in systemic sclerosis .    2.4725298880692814
abstract the term acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( UNK ) reflects an acute worsening of the stable state with an increase in dyspnea , cough , and count or UNK of UNK .    2.5996588669198233
the management of an acute exacerbation is guided mainly clinical severity which has implications on the decision of outpatient management , hospital management or intensive care treatment .    2.2144760942685284
cardiopulmonary comorbidity and the number of previous exacerbations are prognostic factors .    2.9724830015604216
the first - line therapy of each exacerbation is the intensification of drug - treatment with 2 - agonists and UNK .    2.4700754272322576
systemic steroids as a short - term course are advocated if hospital - treatment is necessary .    2.661465813499373
infections of the respiratory tract are a frequent cause of acute exacerbations .    3.2650842108843037
however , a colonization with potential pathogenic microorganisms is found in many patients in the stable state .    2.6958231700081456
antibiotic treatment is justified if cardiopulmonary comorbidity and frequent previous exacerbations are present .    2.5326207254824125
the severity of airflow obstruction and the frequency of previous exacerbations are linked to the spectrum of the underlying microorganisms .    2.900060125392502
this should be borne in mind for the choice of the UNK treatment .    3.110895374927307
as a consequence the number of UNK and the attributable morbidity and mortality are reduced .    3.524208626398687
if invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary , the potential of dynamic UNK in acute exacerbation has to be considered .    2.894566850062879
each year 14 chosen senior medical students get a two weeks intensive training in order to function as peer tutors for the bedside teaching .    2.167508836687618
the peer tutors train the junior students in basic behaviour and clinical examination skills .    2.03923524877635
each UNK is active during 4 - 5 skills lab periods , and in each period he / she UNK two groups of two students each .    2.323778008694299
there are two typical lesions : odontoid fracture in the upper cervical spine and compression fracture in thoracolumbar spine .    2.2109415060465896
odontoid fracture is the most frequent lesion in cervical spine in the elderly .    3.063569912929738
this is caused by trabecular structure of dens axis and spine ' s stiffness in old age .    2.1458972720768097
instable fractures in extension type ii are most common .    2.55427088291624
in many cases the instability of the lesion is hidden and can be first seen in functional examination controlled by x - ray .    2.537400691855056
conservative treatment is efficient in stable lesions type iii while there is a high risk for pseudarthrosis in treatment of instable lesions in elderly with halo fixateur e . g . we think that the best operation for these fractures is the anterior screw fixation .    2.271866053927317
if this is not sufficient because of low bone mass or early dislocation of the screws a dorsal fusion c1 / c2 with transarticular UNK e . g . should be done .    2.339148123935158
in many cases it ' s not easy to distinguish acute lesions from healed fractures or tumor lesions .    2.138271219169183
therefore there are just few compression fractures ( a type ) that have to be treated operatively .    2.593656141202758
an even more adequate stabilisation is done with an additional vertebral replacement .    2.256037432377182
following curative minimal - invasive laser resection of t1 - t3 laryngeal carcinomas , patients were subjected to an intensive voice rehabilitation .    2.1663387359656334
therapy was effected twice a day for approximately 2 months , utilizing the concept of functional voice therapy .    2.371684622069557
before and after rehabilitation , acoustic analyses were made by using two different computer - supported measuring systems : ( 1 ) the " multidimensional voice program " ( kay UNK UNK . ) and ( 2 ) a novel software program developed in göttingen that includes a new voice quality parameter based on correlations between frequency bands .    2.1657702482702805
acoustic analyses showed superiority of the glottal versus UNK compensatory phonation .    2.244384020188886
findings showed that not all acoustic parameters equally documented voice improvement after rehabilitation .    2.1876603697217543
the standard deviation of fundamental frequency was the only parameter showing a significant post - therapeutic improvement .    2.2001616564764404
a further suitable acoustic method proved to be the voice quality parameter that has been newly introduced by us .    2.6027442691228546
in contrast to analogous parameters of other methods , this approach is independent of the exact UNK of the glottal excitation function , thus permitting reliable results to be obtained even with UNK or heavily UNK voices .    2.4036930700266312
aseptic pseudarthrosis may occur after all kinds of traumatology treatment .    2.4797213187804577
following conservative treatment , incomplete immobilisation or an UNK bone fragment can be causal .    2.3230359928870734
after plate osteosynthesis the biomechanical principles are not efficient or the circulatory damage delays healing .    2.107201797258705
there are two broad types of pseudarthrosis : vascular and UNK .    2.182623225362675
the extent of UNK can be demonstrated by bone scintigraphy as well as x - ray .    3.437725623119186
the treatment of vascular nonunions is very common .    2.6412686725782066
mechanical stability is required , therefore a new osteosynthesis is desirable .    2.4730383671665206
osteoporosis caused by inactivity and dislocation increases the rate of complications .    2.665813947535022
much more difficult problems are encountered in treatment of unreactive and UNK pseudarthrosis , particularly in cases with a defect of bone substance .    2.7294773180795344
these defects can be treated with a segment transfer and a fibula - to - tibia operation .    2.7412745838163
extracorporal lithotripsy has been established as a new method in treatment of active and vascular nonunions .    2.8179223703835072
former osteosynthesis is not a contraindication .    3.243801563704628
stability and immobilisation are necessary .    2.7314023234589793
treatment in the low - frequency magnetic field shows no effect .    2.8028032540206267
correct biomechanical and biological osteosynthesis with proper attention paid to location , quality of bone and UNK can avoid the development of a pseudarthrosis .    2.6058733005586867
aim of the study : the goal of this study was to assess the prevalence of ophthalmological abnormalities in 10 year old survivors with extremely low birthweight of 500 - UNK g . in addition the association between retinopathy of prematurity and other ophthalmological disorders was studied .    2.2483660714822093
background : although the majority of surgeons regard hartmann ' s operation as therapeutic standard in perforations of the colon complicated by peritonitis this procedure has been critically discussed in recent years .    2.266096141587154
advocates of one - stage techniques criticized bad postoperative results ( high morbidity and mortality ) and long - term outcome ( low rates of intestinal restoration ) .    2.4256341858516537
the aim of our study was to investigate whether the late results after hartmann ' s operation justify this criticism .    2.1555945649753703
method : from 1982 to 1997 hartmann ' s operations were performed in 103 patients for colonic perforations .    2.451079635720454
in 63 % of cases inflammatory diseases caused colonic complications .    2.7649908876325293
the average UNK peritonitis index ( UNK ) was 19 .    3.160295832005275
seventeen patients died postoperatively ( mortality : 16 . 5 % ) .    2.465291046646741
in 69 patients ( 80 % ) intestinal restoration could be performed after an average interval of 122 days ( complication rate : 6 % , no mortality ) .    2.453594770743784
on follow - up , patients were asked to give information on their general state , changes of UNK , abdominal complaints , and quality of life .    2.915191797394302
results : data on 93 % of patients could be obtained .    3.0529277432612494
the median follow - up time was 75 months .    2.755457038363041
eleven patients had died ; the remaining 72 were investigated .    2.6173845351948555
86 % described the quality of their lives as good or very good ; only 11 % indicated severe loss of activity .    2.208070952076867
quality of life did not differ between patients in whom intestinal continuity had been restored and those in whom it had not been restored .    2.426831018187132
anastomotic strictures developed in 7 % of cases , always after UNK anastomosis .    2.7045600691927425
conclusions : according to our results , long - term outcome after hartmann ' s operation is good .    2.8685589714731754
80 % of patients underwent intestinal restoration with low morbidity ( 6 % ) and no mortality .    3.2533276239506628
a great majority of patients indicated the quality of their lives as good or very good : this assessment was not dependent on restoration of intestinal continuity .    2.3086505569380558
tibial torsion defects are usually not clinically evident and , hence , are often overlooked .    2.41316033824756
clinical examination and ct scan have proved to be the best ways of measuring static tibial torsion , whereas dynamic measurements are usually performed in the clinic and the " gait laboratory . "    2.4209925986859835
only few studies have determined there to be a connection between a torsion defect in the lower leg and expected pathological conditions of the knee and ankle joints .    2.778161357437424
however , UNK instability , UNK - UNK disease , osteochondrosis dissecans are increasingly being found in cases of increased external tibial torsion and arthrosis in reduced torsion .    2.6496496182011797
the aim of this study was to ascertain to what extent homeless , mentally ill subjects in munich take advantage of available psychosocial services .    1.9003467658730584
to obtain a representative picture of the situation , the first step was to ascertain how many people in munich are actually homeless .    2.4241154784741603
using the standardized diagnostic interview schedule ( dis ) , 146 men and 32 women were interviewed .    2.020885900265924
the results according to the dsm - iii demonstrated high lifelong and 6 - month prevalence of psychic disturbances .    2.5275511785107456
medical and social services were often UNK , but mostly over a short period of time in particularly critical situations .    2.4836915632024206
women were treated more often than men .    2.611756074782037
elements such as age and level of education hardly influenced patients ' seeking help .    2.302017526171836
despite a high prevalence of UNK disease , alcohol and drug clinics were rarely consulted .    2.4312828492119034
the increase in the number of diagnoses was paralleled by an increase in the number of patients seeking help .    2.942366510921755
most treatments involved schizophrenia and anxiety .    2.46387047681991
by means of logistic regression models , predictors of the extent to which these services were used were analysed .    2.3732895371180924
we conclude that new clinical models are needed and that the UNK to the present care system is too great .    2.735963056017325
continued treatment occurs only rarely .    2.6023378117020575
electrocardiographic and clinical characteristics are currently used as diagnostic criteria for the long qt - syndrome .    2.77749343107731
UNK and UNK therefore created a point system as a guide in clinical decision making .    2.3444546900107226
in recent years genetic diagnostics have entered the arena of long - qt assessment .    2.2801103784910217
aside from new insights into the pathophysiology of the long qt - disorder , it is expected that genetic diagnostics will offer substantial help to ascertain long qt - syndrome in patients with borderline electrocardiographic and clinical findings and improve risk stratification in long - qt family members .    2.5871350743914796
performing linkage analysis , coupling of autosomal - dominant congenital long qt - syndrome ( UNK - ward syndrome ) to chromosomes 11 ( UNK / UNK . 5 ) , 3 ( UNK / UNK ) , 7 ( UNK / UNK ) , and 4 ( UNK / UNK - 27 ) was demonstrated .    3.330962512007586
more recently , the disease genes in long qt - syndrome 1 , 2 , and 3 could be identified .    2.628784116959033
analysis of the base - pair sequence allowed detection of several different mutations in different families illustrating genetic heterogeneity .    2.1526566083390075
aside from diagnostic aspects , molecular genetics may also guide pharmacological therapy by identifying the specific ion - channel disorder leading to qt - prolongation and sudden death .    1.8136339027472923
during the past 4 years we have demonstrated in eyes with corneal pathology that applanation tonometry ( UNK , UNK ) generally delivers UNK low measurements in comparison to intraocular needle tonometry .    2.4190701948434583
the aim of this study was to evaluate whether impression tonometry ( UNK ) is more precise than applanation tonometry in UNK the intraocular pressure in eyes with corneal disorders .    2.413056727276948
the case of a 24 - year - old woman with a plunging ranula is reported .    2.7079957913061308
primarily , the patient noticed extensive swelling of the neck , which had developed 3 months previously .    3.0082834290102074
the polycystic , firmly attached tumor and the sublingual and submandibular glands of the right side of the neck were surgically removed .    2.4383946657997195
pathological examination showed a retention cyst by means of a plunging ranula .    2.661810080586218
the etiology , pathogenesis , clinical aspect and diagnostic procedures for the plunging ranula are described .    2.3554661487855855
various therapeutic possibilities are discussed in regard to their value .    3.213470879972296
we prefer surgical treatment with a histological examination to verify the diagnosis .    2.8632670745357687
the plunging ranula originates on the sublingual gland ; therefore , its simultaneous extirpation is recommended to avoid recurrences .    2.1659897491860027
in extensive cases , the additional removal of the submandibular gland can be advised .    2.61832482950111
cranial dural fistulae are rare ; when they occur , it is usually difficult to detect them at an early stage .    2.651137391523793
with a view to the question of possible progress in diagnosis we now report on seven patients with lateral dural fistulae fed by branches of the external carotid artery .    2.354896201752631
the examination was carried out before selective arteriography using cw - doppler sonography and colour coded duplex sonography in combination .    2.4100782404240646
sonographic criteria for detection of hyperperfusion take account of flow velocity as well as UNK .    2.8813708169213545
in all cases hyperperfusion of the external carotid artery and the common carotid artery was detected .    2.688708102692015
in most of these cases pathologic findings were also observed at the occipital artery , and more rarely in the contralateral external carotid artery or the ipsilateral vertebral artery , in addition .    2.4818191524612394
a possible source of error arising from confusion of blood vessels was present with the cw - doppler sonography , but not for colour coded duplex sonography .    2.2985480634302777
therefore , cranial dural fistulae characterized by a high shunt volume can be diagnosed correctly by indirect doppler sonographic criteria using cw - doppler and duplex sonography .    2.2328520303898998
direct visualization of the fistula and its nidus requires additional selective arteriography , in the course of which endovascular embolization may be performed .    2.7770815220300835
background : echocardiography is a standard imaging technique for the assessment of heart valve disease .    2.7486369814501064
the good spatial and temporal resolution is the basis for different methods which provide information about the severity of such defects .    2.722890612441289
dynamic colour visualisation and volumetric measurements of regurgitant UNK are a new evaluating tool for the assessment of heart valve insufficiencies .    2.259330144280486
in germany , as in all industrial nations , there has been an increase in the number of cases of cancer and in cancer - related mortality .    2.757037142851747
according to the german federal UNK of statistics , in 1998 nearly UNK , 000 persons died due to malignant cancer .    2.1208581575796055
cancer patients generally have physical and psychological dysfunction that may in turn cause a significant reduction in quality of life if treatment is performed insufficiently or not at all .    2.2823477777002625
pain is the dominant symptom and can have serious effects on the patient and his or her family .    2.8053333233917326
although various organizations have published treatment plans for adequate pain therapy , in many cases they are not adequately applied by physicians .    2.329452271193922
this work therefore offers a comprehensive review of pain therapy as an essential component of palliative medicine .    2.3413718763038074
this retrospective study shows the results in 30 patients of revision surgery on their UNK acl .    2.6701473014833517
the follow - up time was 30 months on average ( range 10 - 54 months ) .    2.328958085143268
the follow - up examination included subjective ( lysholm score , tegner activity level rating score ) , clinical and radiological criteria and also instrumental laxity testing with the kt - 1000 UNK .    2.1078909464937317
the overall evaluation was done according to the ikdc score .    2.8905759140347453
the follow up showed subjective and objective results almost equal to those after primary surgery on acl .    2.2931951800406036
the ikdc score revealed certain abnormal and highly abnormal results , which demonstrated that revision acl surgery gives poorer results than primary surgery .    1.9038668942619368
nevertheless , we recommend reconstruction of a torn acl even in a revision case to restore the knee function and prevent further menisceal and chondral damage and degeneration .    2.121845887272919
nowadays , restorative proctocolectomy is considered the " gold standard " in the surgical therapy of ulcerative colitis .    2.8089039709326356
alternative procedures such as brooke ileostomy or UNK pouch are limited to special indications .    2.356803484127138
preservation of function is the decisive advantage of the ileoanal pouch , but preservation of function is not equal to quality of life .    2.3343877474054575
quality of life is a multidimensional concept that is difficult to define and measure .    2.518457686973864
preoperatively , patients with ulcerative colitis have a restricted quality of life , depending on the intensity of their disease .    2.9106901163527983
proctocolectomy is the curative therapy and improves quality of life .    2.5183816744434924
when evaluating quality of life it is not essential if patients are treated by brooke ileostomy or restorative proctocolectomy .    2.7602744897218563
the advantage of restorative proctocolectomy is the improvement in some aspects such as sexuality and physical UNK .    2.519736947442617
the " total quality - of - life index " is not UNK .    2.640623110626246
preoperatively , patients should be informed that preservation of function by restorative proctocolectomy is accompanied by an increased postoperative morbidity in comparison to other procedures .    2.706727365904325
decreased quality - of - life results when complications occur postoperatively that cannot be controlled over a long period of time .    2.3925630807241554
in some cases excision of the ileoanal pouch may be the most sensible way of solving the problems .    2.6807554662225166
on the other hand , patients without complications and good function after ileoanal pouch procedure may achieve a quality of life comparable to that of healthy controls .    2.2348130634759817
preoperatively , patients should be aware of this risk - benefit relationship and should share the responsibility of the decision for or against restorative proctocolectomy .    2.160238178005709
the objective of this investigation was the experimental determination of the contact pressures in the hip joint for characteristic phases of the gait cycle .    2.5490460940737183
the joint forces determined in vivo with telemetric endoprosthesis by UNK et al .    2.088715425910609
( 1993 ) were converted into a pelvic reference system , based on UNK gait analysis .    2.4704137987420935
in eight cadaveric hip joints ( age 18 - 75 yrs . )    2.2877611119182606
the reaction forces were applied corresponding to four phases of the gait cycle ( heel UNK , mid - stance , heel off , toe off ) and the pressure distribution determined with fuji pressure sensitive film .    1.9694601853897082
we found maxima of 10 mpa during mid stance .    2.2152290595555577
the areas of highest pressure were located in the UNK - superior aspect of the acetabulum ( anterior part of the acetabular roof ) and in the UNK - inferior aspect of the lunate surface .    3.854362310680915
the pressure distribution was relatively constant during the four phases and the maxima did not vary proportional to the applied load .    2.0623972803013695
the normal pressure distribution in the hip appears to be determined by the physiological UNK of the articular surfaces and the inhomogeneous bony support of the acetabulum .    3.453656770651039
during operative interventions this normal load transfer should be restored as accurately as possible .    1.980785832750903
in spite of its serious sequelae , volatile substance abuse ( UNK ) UNK very little public attention in germany .    2.412017025048515
our case report describes an adult male who inhaled propane for recreational purposes .    2.1228852677836283
initially , he achieved short - lived euphoria and hallucinations .    2.171923783299324
he compensated for the developing tolerance by increasing the dosage , finally consuming 5 UNK of fluid propane daily .    2.0086976860281873
getting such quantities was facilitated by his occupational access to propane .    2.1213641583608807
since he abused the propane in an UNK house , he also exposed third UNK to the danger of explosion .    2.3547979667808585
clinical examination revealed disturbances in orientation , restricted UNK and concentration , reduced UNK performance , and psychomotor agitation .    2.1070119554954387
all these symptoms diminished during a 6 - month follow - up .    2.515747038113875
the relationship of his organic mental disorder to the abuse of propane was not clear , since he had also abused alcohol .    1.9871727442612408
objectives the marburg external UNK ( mpt ) fixator is designed to temporarily protect a reconstructed distal extensor apparatus of the knee .    1.963218643997119
it allows an early functional aftercare .    2.5060325596170796
the indications or ultrasound in the evaluation of pulmonary disorders are described .    2.7561927797772836
clinical applications are several lung diseases in adults and especially in children .    2.628556408563763
sonography provides important additional information to chest x - ray and is even superior to ct under special circumstances .    2.3980264722340663
pulmonary sonography is a useful link between conventional x - ray and more expensive cross - sectional imaging .    2.707165172002755
in the evaluation of pulmonary diseases at present the potential of ultrasound is not optimally used .    2.796161328324178
traditionally oral surgeons and dentists have evaluated the jaws using intraoral films and panoramic radiographs .    2.0174520454754785
the involvement of radiologists has been limited .    2.6867015821367937
in the past few years dedicated ct - software - programs developed to evaluate dental implant patients have provided a new look at the jaws .    2.0021648391996276
the complex anatomy is described and identified on human UNK and on axial , panoramic , and cross - sectional images .    2.3622863524018123
with this anatomic description dental - ct - scans are used to demonstrate the anatomy of maxilla and the mandible .    2.5633179234329737
an overview of the technique of dental - ct is provided , furthermore the radiation dose of different organs is explained .    2.5118570772765523
suggestions to reduce these doses by simple modifications of the recommended UNK are given .    2.3022503574807556
the debate on passive and active euthanasia has met a controversial echo both in the german - speaking media and in professional publications within recent years .    2.1412124824171266
this discussion , however , largely excluded mentally ill patients .    3.0019854431868747
also , euthanasia advocacy groups have usually UNK themselves from euthanasia in psychiatric patients .    2.0096006805509417
we report here two cases from our hospital in which in - patients with affective disorders committed assisted suicide during a hospital pass .    2.1110076145592154
we discuss these events under the assumption that these are cases of questionable active euthanasia in mentally ill patients whose judgement was considerably compromised by their disorder .    2.0572294261927704
definition of the problem : in germany , the dissection rate of the deceased is distinctly lower than in many other european countries .    2.580514887674945
although critics of autopsies use to put forward ethical objections and religious UNK , neither the christian UNK nor UNK stand opposite to the UNK of autopsies .    2.1956500926545695
currently undergoing a clinical trial a new miniaturized UNK ultrasound probe potentially enhances the practicability of perioperative transesophageal echocardiography ( tee ) without loss of echocardiographic quality .    2.0101344272499353
echocardiographic quality was tested by two independent investigators by analyzing the percentage of the endocardium contour detection ( < 50 % , 50 - 75 % , 75 - 100 % ) in the left ventricular short - and long - axis views .    2.638191356346601
results : in 11 patients , more than 50 % of endocardium were visualized continuously with both probes .    2.4709731597223468
although the nasal tee probe was inferior to conventional tee in detecting lateral endocardium , automated endocardium detection compared well with both methods .    1.9508503054719961
inter - and UNK variability in manual measurements of the left ventricular cross - sectional area was below 5 % on average and differed non - significantly with regard to the method .    2.8028238417125215
in 2 patients , continuous monitoring was aggravated by repeated loss of contact between the miniaturized tee probe and mucosa .    2.1309918741122926
by means of modern color - coded duplex sonography ( ccds ) even very small vessels can be visualized .    2.2824528567717732
maximum resolution nowadays is about 0 . 5 mm diameter of the vessel .    3.3366545424802045
besides morphologic criteria , hemodynamic criteria were recorded .    2.3457436626377604
arteries in healthy fingers appear as long and straight vessels with a clearly defined border .    2.120454921001226
the physiological maximal blood flow velocity UNK 20 cm / s .    2.3124772244646
ccds revealed UNK of finger arteries as typical finding in UNK obliterans .    2.2022328299368144
segmental stenosis can either be identified morphologically or quantified by measurement of the flow velocity with poststenotic maximal systolic velocities of less than 20 cm / s or by the acceleration of the blood flow within the stenosis , as proven by angiographic examinations .    2.210391053696532
apart from diagnosis of disturbed acral circulation , other possible applications of ccds are in in the surgical field , for example UNK in hand or finger surgery .    2.243109702225746
the discussion of the UNK vs UNK UNK court case in the " american journal of psychiatry " raised the question whether individual psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy is the appropriate treatment for severe depression .    2.488898987665187
a summary of the crucial points and a review of the clinical and scientific implications of this case is presented .    2.8905681891096613
in addition , the difference between psychiatrists and psychotherapists regarding the assessment of depressive disorders is examined by analysing results of the icd - 10 research criteria study .    2.5351797378186185
in the case of one patient with UNK ( icd - 10 UNK : UNK . 1 ) psychotherapists tended more towards a reactive or neurotic etiology than psychiatrists .    2.5193910035177463
by contrast , the percentage of clinicians UNK an endogenous etiology and thus , diagnosing a psychosis and starting a UNK was markedly higher among psychiatrists .    2.1873426571280605
in conclusion , the integration of different UNK and treatment modalities is emphasized as an essential task for both psychotherapists and psychiatrists .    2.395351868752358
for certain patients , an integrated therapy may be more effective .    2.7128494437274897
a 43 - year - old patient was admitted for severe claudicatio in his right leg , doppler ultrasound and angiography revealed an occluded right common iliac artery .    2.180391262993455
in order to protect the the aortoiliac bifurcation , a primary stent implantation of the occluded side was carried out using the kissing balloon technique .    2.498086903203357
afterwards three stents were placed .    2.674785629797286
subsequently the patient completely improved ; treadmill exercise test and duplex sonography showed good results .    2.1921510949443452
conclusion : using the kissing balloon technique , laser - assisted recanalisation of iliac artery occlusions even involving the aortoiliac bifurcation compare favorable to other more invasive treatments .    1.928960163125135
a surgical procedure can thus be avoided .    2.641532577185598
the typical mri features of the most common pancreatic diseases , such as pancreatitis and adenocarcinoma of the pancreas , have been established .    3.4694584848138432
however , even in these common pancreatic disorders , mri correlation with the underlying pathology is limited for clinical reasons .    2.4046857889721722
we emphasize mr - pathological correlation of inflammatory and neoplastic pancreatic changes , including pancreatitis , adenocarcinoma , acinar cell carcinoma , rare cystic and solid pancreatic neoplasms , and islet cell tumors .    1.9373181455385813
by UNK the correlation of key pathological features with mr findings , a better understanding of the mr appearance of pancreatic pathology can be provided .    2.4077049099497563
in addition , mri may prove a powerful tool in detection and characterization of pancreatic tumors .    2.077111904078767
background : the implantation of a femoro - popliteal bypass graft represents the gold standard in the management of arteriosclerotic occlusive disease in the femoro - popliteal region .    2.442683336546956
application of interventional techniques has permitted the development of a novel , endovascular implantable bypass system .    2.428870516476142
the present study investigated the technical properties of the new system in cadavers , with subsequent evaluation of its application in humans .    2.5375074891620826
methods : the endopass consists of a thin - wall UNK tube with a total length of 53 cm .    2.40770913649229
the distal end is connected with a self - expanding stent prothesis 4 cm in length .    2.4259038914497215
endovascular implantation is performed through a groin incision .    2.4147734689061173
following antegrade ringstripper - tea , the endopass is introduced into the femoral artery after placement of a guide wire .    2.5369548421262604
the proximal anastomosis is performed surgically .    2.508382986691087
results : the technical requirements and feasibility of the system were tested on 12 cadaver extremities .    2.427093765686678
implantation of the device proved technically successful in seven of eight extremities with significant occlusion of the superficial femoral artery .    2.5621210991547754
the most important problems included the complete ringstripper - tea , the placement of the guide wire following the tea , and the expansion of the endopass .    2.467418836931117
following approval by the ethics commission , the endopass was implanted in five patients between june 1997 and march 1998 .    2.4844360786663158
in three patients , the endopass remained patent and has UNK well .    2.8915046711542836
one patient with poor vascular outflow suffered an early UNK occlusion , while in the remaining case , perforation secondary to the ringstripper procedure forced us to UNK the attempt .    2.404275462709697
conclusion : experience from the cadaver study and initial human applications confirm the feasibility of this method .    2.290191817153284
further development and methodological improvement , however , are necessary requiring additional , larger studies on patients .    2.5608513981788152
introduction : there is no data available on the action of etomidate on ion currents in human neuronal cells .    2.5448809785427615
therefore the effects of etomidate on a human neuronal delayed UNK potassium current were investigated .    2.4212293479603417
in order to evaluate patients ' exposure to radiation in computed tomography , dose quantities such as the computed tomography dose index ( ctdi ) , multiple scan average dose ( msad ) and dose free in air on the axis of rotation are used .    2.010516165551917
the ctdi and the msad , UNK from the ctdi , are a good measure for the absorbed doses in the examined volume , but they do not take the biological sensitivity of the organs into account and do not describe the radiogenic risk that is actually relevant for patients and doctors .    2.2250160769790637
the dose on the axis of rotation is not an accurate measure of the effective dose and the radiogenic risk .    2.3281504863870603
the UNK of a limit for the dose on the axis of rotation should take the different regions into account , in order to guarantee acceptable image quality on one hand and to avoid an unnecessarily high risk on the other side .    2.5296252635013574
as physical dose quantities , the ctdi , msad and dose on the axis of rotation are useful to characterize and differentiate between programs and systems concerning radiation exposure .    1.8676427135403504
prognosis of patients surviving acute myocardial infarction has substantially improved over the last two decades .    2.7245118676142854
however , stratification of patients at risk for death due to arrhythmic events remains a clinical challenge .    2.4632071267040705
due to the important role of the autonomic nervous system in the genesis of sudden death , autonomic markers such as heart rate variability and baroreflex sensitivity have recently gained attention as risk stratification parameters .    2.392856720206821
the present study reports the results of noninvasive risk stratification in UNK consecutive postinfarction patients treated due to contemporary therapeutical guidelines with a high proportion of patients discharged with a patent infarct related artery .    2.2982406864321665
the diagnostic arsenal of risk parameters comprised heart rate variability , baroreflex sensitivity , and more traditional markers such as non - sustained ventricular tachycardia , left ventricular ejection fraction , and ventricular late potentials .    2.3465041213641538
patiens were followed for a mean of 33 + / - 21 months .    3.2406291434700476
stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that left ventricular function , both autonomic markers , and the patency of the infarct related artery were independent predictors of the prospectively defined primary study endpoint , i . e . , all - cause mortality plus ventricular tachyarrhythmic events .    2.209873988911307
with respect to the secondary endpoint ( ventricular tachyarrhythmic events ) , left ventricular function , heart rate variability , and infarct vessel patency were independent predictors .    2.4816603619706274
ventricular late potentials and UNK ventricular tachycardia had no predictive value with respect to ventricular tachyarrhythmic events .    2.604306637091865
these findings from a large prospective long - term study demonstrate the value of markers of cardiac autonomic tone in identifying infarct survivors at risk for malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmias and sudden death .    2.3411881447594176
k + channels and UNK of drugs : implications for drug toxicity assessment - the time required for repolarization of the ventricles can be measured as the qt interval of the ecg and is determined primarily by activation of the delayed UNK k + current ( UNK ) , which consists of a rapid component ( ikr ) and a slow component ( UNK ) .    2.437656972767808
drugs that block cardiac ikr prolong the cardiac action potential ( ap ) .    2.051108901320765
prolonged repolarization is detected as a longer qt interval on the ecg .    2.197216071955548
during prolonged aps , increased UNK currents induce early UNK , which increase the risk of UNK de UNK ( tdp ) cardiac arrhythmias .    2.458032261622954
tdp arrhythmia is characterized by an apparent UNK of the electrical axis around the UNK line .    2.9983466803956937
it has a rate of 150 to 250 beats / min and it can occasionally UNK into ventricular fibrillation that may be fatal .    2.384284201608913
the incidence of drug - induced tdp arrhythmias is highest among class ia and class iii antiarrhythmic agents .    2.2515890062180994
however , under certain clinical conditions , also several non - cardiovascular medicinal products induce qt interval UNK in the ecg or tdp arrhythmias .    2.2666754242391622
since all drugs known to cause tdp block ikr , an early evaluation of possible effects on aps of cardiac myocytes expressing ikr channels during the developmental phases of novel drugs seems to be recommended .    2.0899284883399316
if in - vitro electrophysiological studies show the new active substance to induce ap prolongation and / or k + channel blockade in appropriate models and at relevant concentrations , either further development of the new active substance may not be justified or the risk factors predisposing to tdp arrhythmias should be taken into account in further clinical studies .    2.295824014551534
carcinoma of the penis is a malignant epithelial tumor of UNK prognosis if not adequately treated .    2.525259875536606
to a large extent the probability of positive lymph nodes is determined by the grade of the primary lesion .    3.0604394538921564
in turn the number of positive nodes greatly influences the survival .    2.832926545784065
in the past the complications of radical ilioinguinal lymphadenectomy have decreased their timely indication .    2.1453048149180702
the modified inguinal lymphadenectomy described by UNK leads to less complications .    2.60159710292255
if performed without delay it should lead to improved survival in patients with higher stage and high grade penile cancer .    2.6225537386493
recently suggested employment of adjuvant and neoadjuvant UNK may further enhance the survival .    2.1169351497102626
on the basis of existing models for psychodynamic diagnostic evaluation and psychoanalytic interview technique and of the theoretical concepts of the 5 axes of the opd diagnosis , a new type of the psychodynamic assessment interview is presented .    2.3014839602411095
the examination is structured in 5 phases : the opening scene , exploration of specific examples for relationships , exploration of experience of self and others , of therapy motivation , and finally clarifying the preconditions for treatment and the ability for insight .    2.085470226307495
the syndrome diagnosis according to icd 10 is completed in a final phase .    2.21650533274949
this psychodynamic - diagnostic assessment interview is recommended , apart from the use for opd diagnosis , for use a clinical instrument .    2.4596026417171637
cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most frequent forms of meningoencephalitis in aids patients .    2.629717032886023
before the introduction of UNK antibiotics like difluconazole , the frequency of this meningitis among aids patients was 5 - 10 % , yet declined during the last years .    2.5448970541937173
clinically , nonspecific signs of a meningeal inflammation UNK while focal neurological signs are rare .    2.3766043361056486
rapid institution of high - dose antimycotic therapy is the UNK to improve prognosis and decrease mortality .    3.1005243298890233
UNK of choice are amphotericin b , fluconazole , and flucytosin .    2.3755503384617604
diagnosis is established by detection of cryptococcal antigen in cerebrospinal fluid , microscopic demonstration of cryptococci using UNK - UNK , and cryptococcal cultures .    2.5575774562580005
during the last years , life - long secondary prevention with difluconazole was established .    2.3007779188739708
cryptococci which are resistent against fluconazole and amphotericin b are a special challenge , yet fortunately are rare .    1.954021692862623
longterm outcome of patients is determined by the progression of the underlying immunsuppression .    3.50419113620641
therefore , combination of secondary prophylaxis with modern UNK substances is important .    2.291244520197888
clinical decision analysis in patients with suspected cryptococcal meningitis is presented using methods from evidence - based medicine .    2.658291547465043
coagulation parameters were monitored intraoperatively using a mobile laboratory .    2.449364823075927
in contrast to the published results , no effect on transfusion requirements could be demonstrated .    2.3669371757016315
however , aprotinin showed a positive effect on some coagulation parameters in the reperfusion phase .    2.410372376849491
the mechanism appeared to be inhibition of the contact activation of the intrinsic system with less thrombin generation in the study group .    2.632297216021753
co - existing inflammation and epidermal UNK characteristic for psoriasis have been shown to be reproducible in several animal models utilizing a variety of different strategies . these models highlight some points of the UNK pathogenesis of psoriasis .    2.4266799323324717
based on observations made in the animal models , a hypothesis is proposed for the pathogenesis of psoriasis , the elements of which can be tested in a recently established UNK transplantation model .    2.550639965691678
adipose tissue tumors are often characterized by typical or even specific chromosomal alterations .    2.2677976376246156
in some of the cases the molecular background of these microscopically visible alterations was already elucidated .    2.404941915626064
in myxoid liposarcomas the translocation t ( 12 ; 16 ) creates a fusion gene between the UNK gene and the UNK gene and in UNK the UNK - c gene becomes UNK by structural aberrations involving chromosomal region UNK - 15 .    2.5899748131180185
based on examples of a lipoma , a well - differentiated liposarcoma , a myxoid liposarcoma , and an aggressive angiomyxoma it is demonstrated in the present paper how cytogenetic investigation can be used as an additional tool for an improved diagnosis of adipose tissue tumors .    2.5343760164758904
furthermore , the detection of molecular mechanisms underlying the visible cytogenetic alterations will certainly significantly increase our knowledge about the pathogenesis of these diseases .    2.5470588811692907
the primary goal of diagnostic imaging of the larynx is analysis of submucosal structures that are not visible by clinical or endoscopic means .    2.4745476652168596
therefore , image analysis of the larynx should only be performed under knowledge of the results of clinical diagnosis .    3.83087977869558
the anatomic relationships of the laryngeal skeleton , the intrinsic structures , and the surrounding soft tissue are presented UNK .    2.7754600115617145
the pattern erg ( perg ) is used as an indicator of retinal ganglion cell function .    2.3654952293284355
up to now , reports on the reproducibility of the perg have been contradictory .    2.3787597372511295
we investigated the reproducibility under the conditions of the forthcoming iscev guidelines for the perg .    2.516308615026871
we simultaneously recorded the perg and vep in 42 eyes of 21 subjects to phase - reversing UNK stimuli with UNK electrodes .    1.8321562579722932
the check sizes were 0 . 4 ° , 0 . 8 ° and 16 ° , the mean UNK 45 cd / m2 , the contrast 98 % , and the field size 32 UNK ° .    2.8321973743211957
measurements were repeated at the same time of day after 1 week .    2.7198900899633114
in addition , we compared two different electrode positions in 16 eyes : ( 1 ) across the cornea along the lower lid ; and deep in the conjunctival sac .    2.1034839546431177
with position ( 1 ) the amplitudes were found to be higher by 20 % than ( 2 ) .    3.0827701662959437
we calculated the coefficient of variation ( cv ) of amplitude as a measure of reproducibility .    2.060561144414459
cv was 7 + / - 1 % for the steady - state perg , 9 + / - 1 % for the transient perg , 12 + / - 2 % for the steady - state vep and 14 + / - 3 % for the transient vep .    2.930068675345993
for the latency of the perg , the UNK cv was found to be 1 . 5 % .    3.2800432986295256
amplitude reproducibility was somewhat higher under steady - state as compared to transient stimulation ; we attribute this to the high noise rejection of the fourier analysis .    2.212303000804653
altogether , the amplitude reproducibility of the perg is somewhat higher than that of the vep .    2.506043569420719
as a result of physical violence to exposed regions of skin ( beating , UNK ) it was possible to effect a mutual transfer of epithelial cells between probands .    2.1392709306011453
the majority of these cells were corneocytes with a minimal incidence of nucleated stratum UNK cells .    2.194246866032967
UNK onto foil - covered UNK resulted in a comparable transfer of cells .    2.380287717812432
UNK afflicted to the upper arms resulted in a successful ` UNK - victim ' assignment via dna typing .    2.3130134572966288
the dna did not only originate from the few nucleated cells but also from the corneocytes themselves , as positively confirmed by investigations of UNK cell - UNK .    1.9643206859414868
the cell concentration achieved in model experiments , however , shows that the forensic value of such a sample is dependent on the presence of nucleated cells .    2.900344183491248
the results of this paper justify the requirement - ( having weighed up the appropriate case - specific modalities ) - that sampling by taking swabs of the skin regions in question must be carried out as soon as possible .    2.130080174451382
ultrasound contrast media increase backscatter from blood thus improving the signal - to - noise - ratio .    2.428449915434506
potential clinical applications of intravenous ultrasound contrast are reviewed .    2.391723811919323
contrast enhancement of continous wave doppler is indicated when the native recordings are UNK and no complete envelope of the doppler spectrum is obtained .    2.1685416702114964
in aortic stenosis several investigations showed good agreement between the gradient calculated from doppler measurements and the results of cardiac catheterization .    2.3711058840034145
in mitral insufficiency maximum area of the regurgitant jet is a widely used parameter for estimation of the severity of the regurgitation .    2.5938172518902625
however , assessment of the maximum jet area may be not possible because poor acoustic windows .    2.3413511470710655
contrast enhancement provides complete display of the regurgitant jet in most of the patients .    2.4484092125232784
the diagnostic confidence of the doppler investigation is further improved by the recording of the pulmonary venous flow , which can be recorded in most of the patients following injection on contrast .    2.8081970981781166
therefore contrast enhanced transthoracic doppler is an alternative to transesophageal doppler investigation in patients with poor transthoracic windows .    2.712017229690798
since 1993 a report UNK system for fractures of the neck of the femur has been established in the department of external quality assurance of the chamber of physicians of westphalia - lippe .    2.5566683185715298
several indicators of good quality have changed significantly since then : conservative treatment decreased from 6 . 8 % in 1993 to 4 . 2 % in 1997 , lethality decreased from 6 . 9 % to 5 . 4 % , average length of stay decreased from 30 . 9 days to 24 . 9 days , average length of stay before operation decreased from 2 . 6 to 2 . 1 days , the frequency of operations on UNK increased , complications in wound healing increased from 4 . 9 to 6 . 0 % , and cardiopulmonary complications decreased from 11 . 2 % to 7 . 8 % .    2.842731075549215
the most frequent and still increasing procedure was implantation of UNK / bipolar prosthesis ( from 38 . 8 % in 1993 to 41 . 0 % in 1997 ) followed by total hip replacement ( decreasing from 37 . 4 % in 1993 to 34 . 2 % in 1997 ) .    2.5505110972522353
operative treatment was performed in more than 90 % of all fractures in all counties of westphalia - lippe .    2.853064572462783
however , there was a wide and significant geographical variation in the choice between osteosynthesis and hip replacement : the percentage of hip replacements differed between 57 % and 82 % among different counties .    1.9970711528670777
average length of stay before the operative procedure for patients undergoing reduction and rigid internal fixation of the fracture is still too long ( 1 . 6 days in 1997 ) .    2.7967008524481525
the etiology of os odontoideum is still controversial .    2.336120204147938
in most patients , it is found by accident because of neurological symptoms and / or painful range of motion of the cervical spine .    2.909412964299165
upon recognition of the os odontoideum , it is unknown whether or not immediate surgery is beneficial .    2.9647036183455353
this is in contrast to an " unstable " os odontoideum , which could result in atlantoaxial instability or compression of the myelon .    2.535098870912234
in this study , we present the results of our treatment of four patients with an unstable os odontoideum .    3.340404294679058
in all four cases , a c1 - 2 fusion was performed ( 3 x magerl / UNK , 1 gallie - brooks ) .    2.370823729709259
postoperatively , we found a complete regression of neurological symptoms in three patients and one was significantly improved .    2.814266230840788
the range of motion of the cervical spine was free of pain in all patients .    3.036724665995212
as a result , we strongly support immediate surgical treatment of an unstable os odontoideum in order to prevent severe and life - threatening neurological complications .    2.8383339419082816
several studies from anglo - american countries indicate that in non - psychiatric hospital departments mentally ill patients have a longer length of hospital stay than mentally well , while in austria and germany , until now , no studies concerning this question exist .    2.3660154397913744
therefore , we investigated the influence of psychiatric comorbidity on the length of stay in 608 patients of medical , surgical and gynecological departments in vienna and UNK .    2.447228720586958
based on the clinical interview schedule , 28 . 1 % of the patients in this sample suffered from psychiatric disorders .    2.8605354021676312
the presence of psychiatric disorders , as well as type of hospital department ( medical department ) , higher age , more previous non - psychiatric treatment periods , and more somatic diagnoses predicted a longer duration of inpatient treatment .    2.348945640844506
to avoid the influence of UNK variables , psychiatric cases were matched with psychiatric non - cases .    2.358337204069506
the mentally ill group was treated for a markedly longer period as inpatients than the mentally well .    2.3673176901618844
patients with a diagnosis of dementia or of substance abuse showed a significantly increased length of stay , while we could not confirm this for other psychiatric diagnoses .    2.482497973976402
the development of new cardiopulmonary bypass technologies , special surgical instruments , as well as intrathoracic video systems facilitates mitral surgery via a small right thoracotomy .    2.202721933743227
functional recovery after bilateral comminuted fractures of the humeral head with posterior dislocation is poor .    2.5989406336108996
when reposition and internal fixation fail , the remaining alternatives are ( hemi ) arthroplasty and / or arthrodesis .    2.39279272912775
in a 50 - year - old patient , we treated the dominant shoulder by arthrodesis ; a neer prosthesis was inserted at the other side .    2.2939848492266544
using this strategy , the advantages of both techniques were combined with an acceptable functional recovery , which ist especially important for young and active patients .    2.315353564019248
commonly used UNK for gut decontamination after oral ingestion of toxic substances are induced emesis , gastric lavage and activated UNK .    2.0663916202442145
it was not until recently that the effectiveness of these procedures was studied systematically .    2.582640485913
the results of these studies are presented and the side effects and complications of the different procedures are discussed .    3.369348044646178
together with the german UNK control centers , guidelines for gut decontamination in pediatric patients were developed , based on the official recommendations of the european association of poisons centres and clinical UNK ( UNK ) and the american UNK of clinical toxicology ( UNK ) .    2.746760083151459
the methodology used to assess postoperative continence has a significant effect on the outcome of incontinence surgery .    2.835692526756877
retrospective chart review studies consistently report higher success rates than patient questionnaire - based outcome analyses .    2.0088535398735154
the purpose of this study was to evaluate the true long - term results of the stamey bladder neck suspension procedure using an anonymous patient questionnaire .    2.4476536944261116
of 172 consecutive patients , 138 ( 80 . 2 % ) returned a questionnaire on long - term continence , complications and subjective satisfaction with the operative result .    2.5221314910547132
with a mean follow - up of 66 months , 65 of 130 evaluable patients ( 50 . 0 % ) remained completely continent while 15 ( 11 . 5 % ) never became continent and 50 ( 38 . 5 % ) had recurrent incontinence 6 - 90 months postoperatively .    2.5089344433102982
almost two - thirds of the patients felt either cured or substantially improved more than 5 years after surgery .    2.640051648693364
stamey bladder neck suspension leads to a persistently improved quality of life despite a considerable failure rate .    2.715569566402418
our study demonstrates the advantages of patient questionnaires for outcome analyses and emphasizes the need for standardisation and validation to allow comparisons between the results of different incontinence procedure in the future .    2.4438937802514227
social work for the elderly in a UNK ageing society is not justified per se , but has to prove its utility under the altering social conditions of the changing age - structure .    2.3512472582299107
in the field of practice , this has led to an increasing need for professional orientation and to UNK for profiles of performance with greater UNK .    2.4693119991338732
pseudoaneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery ( ica ) can be caused by external injury or may be due to spontaneous dissection .    2.794795800835696
pseudoaneurysms bear an increased risk of arterio - arterial embolism .    2.6743890577210845
treatment of pseudoaneurysms is influenced by the location and the type of injury , associated UNK , collaterals to the ipsilateral hemisphere , neurological signs and symptoms , growth of the lesion and patient age .    2.5198136710798056
potential treatment regimen include conservative and medical approaches with anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy , extra - intracranial bypass , resection of the pseudoaneurysm with vessel reconstruction , ligation or endovascular balloon occlusion of the ica .    2.03890529731643
pseudoaneurysms of the ica adjacent to the UNK base require a major surgical procedure .    2.554199345406734
if there are contraindications for vessel occlusion conservative or medical treatment used to be the only therapeutic alternatives .    2.5196189958112956
we report the treatment of two patients with extracranial ica pseudoaneurysms after blunt injury with stent placement ( in one case combined with coil embolization ) as a further treatment option .    2.57254891616302
introduction : the combination of direct magnification mammography and computed radiography provides an improvement in spatial resolution of storage phosphor - based digital systems .    2.2381589374686484
a clinical study comparing conventional and digital direct magnification mammograms was performed .    2.348593613905618
methods : 100 survey mammograms in 1 . 5 - or 1 . 7 - fold magnification and 50 4 - fold spot magnification views were obtained with a prototype direct magnification mammography system and a storage phosphor - based digital system .    2.2635313861380992
an intraindividual comparison of these with previous conventional radiograms of the same patients was carried out .    2.4951895822907546
results : the diagnostic value of digital survey mammograms using the direct magnification technique is comparable to that of conventional radiograms of the breast , especially with regard to the identification of microcalcifications and lesions and the clinical consequences .    2.695787164562775
spot magnification views performed with this combination of techniques allowed improvement in the evaluation of microcalcifications .    2.7040070578246116
in 15 % of cases , diagnostic procedures were adjusted accordingly .    3.278975156833409
conclusion : the combination of the direct magnification technique with digital storage phosphor radiography systems allows the performance of digital mammography by improving the overall spatial resolution .    2.2458412975922943
the diagnostic value of digital direct magnification survey mammograms was comparable to that of conventional mammograms .    2.432528032672769
digital 4 - fold spot magnification views improved visualisation of the morphologic aspects of microcalcifications .    2.102770357848042
warthin ' s tumour of the larynx is an unusual finding .    2.6787625430808206
in present literature only four cases have been reported .    2.5531098058401698
only one case of a woman suffering from warthin ' s tumour of the UNK gland and the ipsilateral site of the larynx has been published .    3.036969083345813
a case of a 74 - year - old woman with an warthin ' s tumour of the right parotid gland and the left false cord is presented .    2.692123034575636
the theories about the development of warthin ' s tumours are discussed .    2.784641388133104
in rheumatic diseases , radiation synovectomy is a reliable method .    2.906471387138749
meanwhile , radiation synovectomy is an outpatient therapy .    2.5918102422373663
in addition , combination with arthroscopic synovectomy is an increasing therapeutic modality .    2.196664119886147
in comparison to the hitherto inpatient modality , a greater lymphatic emigration of the radionuclide and , therefore , a higher radiation exposure is possible .    2.442321816387532
in 35 patients we found radionuclide emigration in 17 cases by whole body scintigraphy , resulting in a 50 % - percentile with 68 . 27 % - confidence interval of 1 . 8 ( 0 . 45 - 4 . 78 ) % of the injected UNK - 90 - activity .    2.6153633825328915
comparison of 3 groups with the above mentioned therapy modalitites resulted in no statistical difference ( p > 0 . 05 ) .    2.130498237897273
because of the found radionuclide emigration , a radiation dose of 0 . 1 ( 0 . 05 - 0 , 18 ) msv in women and 0 . 2 ( 0 . 1 - 0 . 38 ) msv in men was calculated .    3.192777895099565
for lymph nodes , liver , spleen and whole body radiation doses of UNK ( 154 - UNK ) msv , 62 ( 15 - 165 ) msv , 62 ( 15 - 165 ) msv and 37 ( 9 - 99 ) msv were calculated .    2.128306117464397
gonadal radiation dose can be neglected and the morbidity rate for tumors UNK of the whole body radiation dose is low with a value of 0 . 4 per UNK .    2.7107319905032283
therefore , radiation synovectomy can be used unlimited by patients age and independent of the therapeutic modality .    2.7800882514833725
the goal of surgery using a thoracoscopic approach for the anterior reconstruction of fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine is the reduction of postoperative pain and morbidity .    2.678295073198207
fusion of the injured segment was performed by partial corporectomy and the vertebral body reconstructed using a tricortical autogenous bone graft .    2.5078182111267466
a plate and screw assembly was inserted to stabilize the surgical correction .    2.402358196098616
this technique was used between may 1996 on may 1998 in 100 patients with 103 fractures of the thoracic and lumbar spine .    2.42311760716816
fractures from t4 to l3 were stabilized ; most fractures occurred at the thoracolumbar junction .    2.149841015600058
a UNK short fusion was given preference in 51 patients .    2.2970634559955267
a UNK approach was necessary in 68 patients on account of the fracture type .    3.060209854654377
comparing a group of 30 patients who had undergone an open procedure and a similar group treated under thoracoscopic assistance , we found a marked reduction of the postoperative need for analgesics and the duration of postoperative ventilation .    2.8426259523159847
UNK external counterpulsation operates by applying ecg - triggered diastolic pressure via UNK to the vascular bed of the lower limbs .    2.4320610828264666
comparable with intra - aortic balloon UNK , pecp produces a diastolic augmentation combined with increase of mean arterial pressure and coronary perfusion .    2.125705055175667
american , asian , and our own data demonstrated a reduction of angina pectoris through repeated use of pecp one or two hours daily for four to seven weeks .    2.138776706178999
exercise testing and thallium scanning confirmed the clinical improvement .    2.3987603596933793
pecp is a virtually UNK treatment option in patients suffering from angina despite medical and UNK treatment .    2.4733270986520184
opening of collaterals and collateral growth induced by external counterpulsation are discussed as the cause of clinical benefit .    2.492617953493585
transrectal fine - needle aspiration biopsy ( fnab ) of the prostate under digital control is a cheap and rapid method for diagnostic evaluation of palpable and non - palpable nodules , yielding high sensitivity ( ca .    2.2452531075356594
95 % ) and a low complication rate ( < 1 % ) .    3.4503557127238067
the UNK of urologists trained in the fnab method and of pathologists experienced in cytology of the prostate limit the clinical application so far .    2.2340507561565794
besides various forms of prostatitis , five different types of cancer can cytologically be differentiated .    2.4468934928825172
while pin i cannot be cytologically identified , pin ii / iii lesions may lead to false - positive diagnoses .    2.22363259630915
cytologic grading of adenocarcinomas of the prostate is of statistically proven prognostic validity and strictly correlated with its histologic UNK .    2.0621661086417564
preoperative , radiologically controlled fnab of pelvic and paraortal lymph nodes has sensitivity of ca .    2.070728909061609
86 % and specificity of 100 % .    2.582589493255594
it thus helps to avoid unnecessary prostatectomies if nodal tumor spread has preoperatively been proven .    2.053739430042969
patients with dna UNK histograms may show detoriation of prognosis under hormonal therapy .    2.045518879715445
dna - aneuploid prostatic cancers should not be subjected to a " wait and see " strategy ; they do not respond to hormonal therapy .    2.2881021141291424
early defibrillation is the standard of care for patients with ventricular fibrillation ( vf ) and pulseless ventricular tachycardia ( vt ) .    2.7447968421134714
technical developments aim at further miniaturization and simplification of defibrillators as well as adaptation of energy requirements to the patient ' s needs .    2.6826777523245675
implantable cardioverter - defibrillators ( icd ) and automated external defibrillators ( UNK ) are based upon the same technology .    2.741443768596753
both devices analyze the ecg signal internally , followed by a " shock " or " no shock " decision .    2.595540874956685
use of automated devices is the prerequisite for defibrillation by non - physicians .    2.3157033345436746
chest impedance measurements and use of alternative shock waveforms , such as biphasic , aim at adaptation of energy or current to the patient ' s individual needs and avoid application of unnecessarily high amounts of energy to the myocardium .    2.238994172478689
calculation of median frequency is a non - invasive method for analyzing the heart ' s metabolic and electrical state .    2.37499928717314
it helps to determine the optimal moment for defibrillation during cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( cpr ) .    2.326964445501815
such developments include early defibrillation programs for emergency medical technicians ( emt ) , nurses , and fire or police department first responders as well as wide distribution of easy - to - operate defibrillators in public areas , as discussed during the american heart association ' s public access defibrillation conferences .    1.9965521870339027
all programs of that kind have to be organized and supervised by a physician who is responsible for training and supervision of the personnel involved .    2.346110709919197
spontaneous breathing with biphasic positive airway pressure ( bipap ) or airway pressure release ventilation ( aprv ) caused a reduction in intrapulmonary shunting and dead space ventilation and improvement in arterial oxygenation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome .    2.326952916298663
during spontaneous breathing with aprv / bipap venous return , cardiac output and oxygen delivery increased while oxygen consumption remained unchanged .    2.1207966281481254
in patients early spontaneous breathing with aprv / bipap was associated with a better arterial oxygenation than in patients receiving controlled mechanical ventilation for 3 days and were then weaned with aprv / bipap .    2.2130449423195486
length of mechanical ventilation , intubation and icu stay was shorter in patients breathing spontaneously early with aprv / bipap .    2.2758700328544137
therefore , early spontaneous breathing with aprv / bipap may be of advantage .    2.3283533756077976
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder ( rbd ) is a rare but clinically distinct disorder which is easily overlooked .    2.352335359456606
it commonly occurs in older men and , because of its similarity to epileptic seizures , is often misdiagnosed .    2.5490970366865136
the etiology of rbd is still unknown .    2.4490505618194134
however , there is an interesting association with parkinson ' s disease which presents some pathophysiological hypotheses .    2.5047187696517286
treatment is usually successful with UNK .    2.7944823818350306
various therapeutic options have been proposed in the treatment of femoral head necrosis ranging from conservative management to total hip arthroplasty .    2.579924237398225
since microsurgical techniques are routinely used in orthopaedic surgery , the importance of revascularization has increased in recent years .    2.624839761056059
vascularized bone grafting as well as various osteotomies have been considered for the stages ii and iii according to ficat and ii , iii and iv of the criteria of the arco system respectively , which also bases on mri - findings .    2.268789937227146
we investigated the results of 80 patients with avascular necrosis of the femoral head treated with a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft , perfused by the a . circumflexa UNK UNK , between 1988 and 1996 .    2.730297232624897
mean follow - up was 5 , 6 years .    2.9991140326143064
the evaluation was based on the harris hip score , clinical and radiological examination as well as a subjective assessment using a vas ( visual analog scale ) .    2.821439606970093
the clinical results according to the harris hip score were good or excellent in 86 , 1 % .    2.702859561140174
these results correlate with the subjective assessment of pain and of the hip joint function with an average of 7 , 9 points using the vas ( max .    3.143026009186443
unchanged radiological appearance over the follow - up period was observed in 47 , 5 % using the arco criterias .    2.950614704418087
reviewing the studies using vascularized grafts , about 50 % of the patients with a stage ii and iii according to ficat and ii , iii and iv of the arco respectively show an unchanged stage of the disease 5 - 6 years after the procedure .    2.6360946951798643
therefore , transplantation of a vascular pedicled iliac bone graft possibly offers the chance to UNK causally in the course of the disease with only little alteration of the biomechanics of the hip joint .    2.3259750790821743
this paper describes preprosthetic surgery from its historical UNK to its present state - of - the - art status .    2.0767182506131086
in an enquiry of 250 german - speaking maxillofacial departments , 160 responded .    2.186526764264567
results showed that a surprising 30 - 50 % of the institutions are still following guidelines for procedures which have been proven by scientific follow - up studies to be almost 100 % unsuccessful .    2.8234104371288957
this paper summarizes the results of an attempt to reconstruct the UNK of jewish pediatricians from germany , vienna and the german pediatric hospitals in prague between 1933 and 1945 .    2.5988061495577486
so far , UNK cases have been cleared up : UNK of them emigrated to 31 countries ; 63 became victims of the holocaust ; other individual UNK included going UNK or UNK suicide .    2.149345525455903
the fate of about 120 persons is still unknown .    2.3960433483255668
this paper discusses the probable reasons for the high percentage of jews in pediatrics , the anti - UNK attitude of the german society for pediatrics and the UNK UNK and UNK of jewish pediatricians in the nazi period .    3.015683907567568
we performed a prospective multi - center study in order to determine the causes of 30 - day perioperative mortality .    3.0641499592777777
the implantation of a mesh is an essential step in laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery .    2.5434003443652267
repeated reoperation for UNK of clips and nerve transection were unsuccessful .    2.4355955486548355
the problem of biocompatibility of UNK currently used in inguinal hernia surgery is discussed .    2.3427073868115187
therapy of advanced renal cell carcinoma remains difficult .    2.794762226047913
new therapeutic schemes besides cytokine treatment should be evaluated .    2.6415893063687252
the following study analyzes the in vitro toxicity of treosulfan on spheroids of 8 primary cultures of renal cell carcinoma cells .    2.3249293337075283
these data were compared to the toxicity of vinblastine .    3.0397397653099993
all investigations were performed in regard to the p - glycoprotein ( pgp ) expression of the cells , which is one of the main causes of multidrug resistance .    3.1759278106099185
four pgp positive and four pgp negative spheroids were incubated with the drugs in increasing doses .    2.112664839625511
toxicity was measured using the mtt toxicity assay as well as UNK blue exclusion .    2.7778221995568098
significantly higher toxicity of treosulfan compared to vinblastine could be demonstrated .    2.3303075372281903
in addition , the effects of treosulfan were not related to pgp expression .    2.6363414414879403
these results are encouraging and a phase ii study analyzing the efficacy of treosulfan in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma has been initiated in our institution .    2.7567295079084233
postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy renders beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids .    2.4210037082394487
additionally , direct protective mechanisms of estrogens in the blood vessels and myocardium are under study .    2.41184171132896
recent findings suggest an improvement in endothelium - dependent vasodilatation and coronary microcirculation .    2.3855361159740767
furthermore , it has also been suggested that this treatment has UNK effects on the left ventricular geometry , i . e . , UNK left ventricular mass and wall thickness .    2.945131033158506
whether the beneficial effects of estrogens are UNK by a combined use with UNK is not yet known and requires further investigation .    2.8260600166012515
malaria is one of the most common infectious diseases worldwide .    2.96720084066668
characteristic signs of malaria are special macroscopic and microscopic organ changes , which may also be seen in postmortem examinations .    2.6371556687355486
modern diagnostic tools allow a fast and reliable diagnosis .    2.532308036301199
the symptoms of malaria are rather unspecific , so the correct diagnosis may be difficult , especially if the doctor is not informed about the patient having been abroad .    2.399679053450052
the cases presented also point out possible legal consequences of a missed diagnosis .    2.2251217529648013
prognostically relevant factors based on the histological assessment of the resected pancreas are known .    3.1926883664105543
however , additional parameters , such as biological staging of the intrinsic malignant UNK of the tumor , would be useful .    3.313801455779445
there has been no uniform finding of a relationship between cd44 variant expression and tumor progression .    2.2873665991440673
method : we assessed the expression pattern and prognostic impact of cd44 standard and cd44 UNK v4 , UNK , v6 , UNK and v10 in 40 ductal pancreatic carcinomas by UNK on paraffin - embedded tumor material in patients after tumor resection .    2.292951672855242
at the time of the investigation neither histomorphological parameters nor the survival time were known .    2.3447881450534247
results : there was no correlation between the histomorphological parameter and the expression of cd44 splice variants .    2.6607546575729657
cd44 splice variants v4 - v10 were almost only expressed in tumor tissue .    2.175922613666563
in ductal pancreatic carcinoma , patients with an UNK of cd44 splice variants had a worse prognosis .    3.1084604484408707
however , because of the small number of cases this was statistically not significant .    3.121069263895461
conclusion : cd44 splice variants may have an influence on prognosis in ductal pancreatic carcinoma .    2.3584514109299235
however , further investigation on a larger number of patients is necessary to confirm these results .    3.0122120402221984
regarding the etiology of thoracic outlet syndrome ( tos ) , congenital bone and / or fibromuscular anomalies , UNK characteristics and trauma play a role .    2.4820009529618043
signs and symptoms are extremely variable , depending on whether the compression of the plexus , of the artery or of the vein is predominant .    2.913810834542655
in the clinical examination the UNK test is of utmost importance .    2.8154563471793526
less than 5 % of the patients show a subclavian artery aneurysm , but 76 % have obstructions of digital arteries .    2.6586391851319613
every patient , must undergo a neurological examination including the measuring of the proximal ulnar and median nerve conduction times .    2.2340316100030453
anatomical lesions of the subclavian artery , reduction of the proximal nerve conduction times and high - degree venous compression as well as disabling pain during the night with abuse of analgesics are absolute indications for the decompression of the neurovascular bundle .    2.7744911946513104
this is achieved by the transaxillary UNK of the first rib together with a cervical rib and fibromuscular bands if present .    2.995007202023958
the results of the primary operation are favourable : completely painfree 85 % , markedly improved 12 % , unchanged or worse 3 % .    2.400793533455143
the results of operations for persisting and recurrent tos are disappointing : completely painfree 48 % , markedly improved 31 % , but 21 % unchanged or worse .    1.997284121453718
this phenomenon has been explained by the classical concept of west et al .    2.256165402186989
based on the isolated UNK lung .    2.7812645343248144
in this article , we review recent publications in which observations have been made which cannot be explained by the west model .    2.32357458468155
a new concept of distribution of regional pulmonary perfusion is presented which centers on vascular factors which are better suited to account for observed blood flow UNK .    1.9875928579134743
the pulmonary vasculature is composed of UNK of one structural unit : the vessel bifurcation .    2.2440390752572634
apart from its size , each single bifurcation is similar to all others .    2.318986979546196
the pulmonary vessel tree can , therefore , be considered to be self - similar .    2.812373430433855
self - similarity has been identified as a design principle of living nature .    2.51768911236807
self - similar objects can produce heterogeneity which is also self - similar when viewed at different scales of magnification .    2.1367082003891786
for measurement of the structure of such objects and their function , i . e . , in this case the heterogeneity of pulmonary perfusion , fractal geometry is best suited .    2.561663308505213
distribution of blood flow within the lung can be described by means of fractal analysis , and all phenomena of perfusion distribution can easily be explained when applying this concept .    2.617484360490645
furthermore , since the basis of fractal analysis is pulmonary vascular anatomy , it lends itself for the study of blood flow distribution .    2.68459130745755
a major advantage is the independence of fractal parameters from resolution of perfusion measurements .    2.0657565771147075
thus , fractal analysis can be used to compare results that have been obtained using different resolutions and different species .    2.573468751687069
fractal methods have previously been used in medicine for other purposes .    2.5453917378920505
nonlinear analyses of heart beat variability can predict the onset of malign cardiac UNK hours before actual appearance in the ecg .    2.2429383434178845
very similar methods applied to electrical brain activity have been shown to allow prediction of UNK seizures approximately 15 min prior to appearance of clinical symptoms .    2.1799128087445614
in part i of the paper the biomechanical and technical background of the eptt using the mpt fixator and the indications for this procedure have been described .    2.4102424407795002
in part ii we report about the clinical application of the eptt in 67 patients with a wide spectrum of repairs and reconstructions of the extensor mechanism .    3.0472635515522764
48 patients had fresh injuries , 18 of them with severe concomitant knee lesions and 19 patients had neglected UNK .    2.251450420440416
there were 4 deep infections , two of them related to the mpt fixator .    2.735632378262317
in the patients with uneventful healing the fixator remained in place for 7 . 3 weeks in average .    2.504334744501053
the clinical , isokinetic and radiological results were reviewed in 17 patients with an average follow - up time of 37 . 3 months .    2.9467170864756427
there were 5 patients with partial UNK and tendon reattachment because of lower patella pole comminution and 12 patients with tendon reattachment ruptured at the inferior patella pole or suture repair in UNK rupture .    2.097222998732369
the clinical results according to the ikdc score were rated in 3 patients as normal , in 10 patients as nearly normal and in 4 patients as abnormal .    2.6705516069652258
this rating was highly dependend on the subjective judgement by the patients who considered their operated knees not as normal as the contralateral knees .    2.2360425357782625
from our clinical experiences and results we can derive that the eptt enables the surgical management of extensor mechanism UNK with a minimum of internal fixation material and provides a safe protection of the repairs and reconstructions during the healing period .    2.233085750530037
the eptt allows immediate unrestricted functional rehabilitation and early walking without crutches .    2.0963899322489556
thus the eptt represents an effective alternative to the UNK - tibial cerclage with a wire or synthetic ligaments .    2.6056730621363107
ondansetron is more effective than a placebo in treating postoperative nausea and vomiting ( ponv ) , but it has not been proved to be superior to established UNK for prophylaxis or therapy .    2.69379878530168
our prospective , randomized double - blind study was performed between 15 october 1992 and july 1993 ; it included 271 gynaecological asa i - iii inpatients who had been operated on under general anaesthesia with intubation .    2.2590995222739134
patients were excluded if : there was no informed consent ; it was an ambulatory or emergency operation ; the patient was pregnant or breast feeding ; allergies were being treated with antihistamines ; drug addiction was present or convulsions or parkinson ' s disease ; any pre - or intraoperative antiemetic medication had been administered .    2.084262689910788
the verbal nausea score ( 1 = none , 2 = mild , 3 = moderate , 4 = severe ) was recorded every 30 min for 4 h , then before and 2 h after each antiemetic dose .    2.0099062442426403
all emetic episodes and the interval between administration and effect were also noted .    2.382470525785638
patients were interviewed 36 - 48 h postoperatively on subjective effects , side - effects and individual acceptance .    2.4698120856830164
after oral premedication with diazepam , anaesthesia was induced with thiopental , in a few cases with etomidate or propofol .    2.343410197254276
relaxation was achieved with pancuronium or atracurium and , when indicated , with succinylcholine .    2.282214772615976
muscular relaxation was antagonized with UNK and UNK .    2.7458361536522267
gastric content was aspirated once after intubation .    2.414388331501459
anaesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide / oxygen , enflurane , halothane or isoflurane and fentanyl up to 0 . 3 mg . statistical evaluation was performed by the unpaired student ' s t - test and the mann - whitney u test .    2.224522777640903
categoric variables were examined by the 2 test .    2.958031879543951
significance was defined as p < 0 . 05 .    3.3527319348835865
of 271 patients , 100 ( 37 % ) experienced ponv .    2.404412460994886
the groups were statistically comparable with respect to demographic data , type and duration of operation , emesis record , perioperative UNK medication .    2.5691230346069136
twenty patients in the ondansetron group and 27 in the droperidol group received the first antiemetic within 2 h , the other patients up to 17 h after extubation .    2.349142844835748
nausea scores and emetic episodes were identical before antiemetic medication .    2.2301999527429377
the reduction of these parameters after medication was similar .    2.5566545569847454
complete response over 6 h was 60 % in the ondansetron and 68 % in the droperidol group .    3.2975479693346714
in both groups the first medication failed in 4 cases during the initial 2 h . twenty of the ondansetron and 16 of the droperidol patients needed a second dose ; among these 2 and 4 , respectively , a third UNK .    2.292590667823941
no rescue medication was necessary over 24 h and a mean of 1 . 4 ampoules was administered in both groups .    2.4532123402521897
onset and quality of emetic action were identical in both groups .    2.4866271146539107
it was not possible to evaluate 25 interviews due to UNK or UNK problems .    3.1621975499792434
multiple side - effects were noted frequently .    3.0635049126697944
injection pain was reported significantly more often in the droperidol , pruritus in the ondansetron group .    2.5590794328175392
ninety - three percent of the ondansetron and 85 % of the droperidol patients opted for the same drug for future ponv treatment .    2.571865576505752
ondansetron ( 8 mg ) and droperidol ( 1 . 25 mg ) proved to be equally effective when used as a postoperative antiemetic .    2.76596463221219
both drugs showed similar side - effects .    2.787759588031212
due to differences in methods it was difficult to compare our results to those obtained in other studies .    2.2530210435552838
paradoxical embolism is well - known in theory but rarely encountered in clinical practice .    2.542903660321009
the typical pathophysiological background is the coincidence of venous thrombosis , elevated right atrial pressure , and a consecutive right - to - left shunting via a patent foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect .    2.4493990761183597
this review summarizes the results of internal cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in comparison to external cardioversion .    3.193717481140773
internal cardioversion was achieved by positioning defibrillation electrodes in the right atrium and coronary sinus ( alternatively in the left pulmonary artery ) .    2.6534659914213377
although in comparative studies the success rate of 91 - 93 % with internal cardioversion is higher compared to success rates of 67 - 79 % with external cardioversion , the conventional method of external cardioversion remains the method of first choice .    2.1713898787809165
the success rate of internal cardioversion after failed external cardioversion ranges from 73 to over 90 % .    2.2376416603947766
possible indications for primary internal cardioversion are : induced atrial fibrillation during electrophysiological studies , atrial fibrillation after cardiothoracic surgery and cardioversion of atrial fibrillation in patients with permanent pacemaker implants .    2.3150996039602925
objective : the objective of the study is to evaluate the importance of home care for patients with advanced tumor diseases and for their families .    3.4529064922655843
vdd single - lead systems use floating ring electrodes for atrial sensing .    2.201249001152302
in this overview , technical determinants of atrial sensing concerning atrial ring configuration ( surface area , ring spacing , full / half ring ) , design of the lead ( insulation material , conductor coil configuration ) , and amplifier design ( differential amplifier , sensing impedance , bandpass filter ) shall be explained and related to determinants at implant ( av distance , site of implantation , atrial position , intraoperative measurement technique ) .    1.8603819061403983
( 1 ) ring configuration : bipolar atrial full ring systems have proved to be efficient with narrow ( 5 - UNK ) or wide ( 15 - UNK ) ring spacing , as well as bipolar half ring systems with UNK configuration and narrow ring spacing .    2.815439787347717
especially in a position close to the atrial wall , a wide ring spacing detects a less clear - cut signal than a short ring spacing ; on the other hand , with a wide ring spacing , sensing is less compromised if the rings move to a worse position further away from the wall .    2.1564005839915024
a narrow ring spacing detects a UNK signal if positioned close to the atrial wall , but a considerable reduction of sensed p wave amplitude may result if it UNK away from the wall or to an oblique angle relative to the atrial depolarization front .    2.0581371777941957
( 2 ) design of the lead : polyurethane as insulation material provides a higher stiffness than silicone insulation .    2.20740101703215
a coaxial conductor configuration increases stiffness and consequently the possibility to UNK the atrial part of the lead .    2.958539527888303
thus , if a position close to the atrial wall is desired , the combination of a coaxial conductor coil , polyurethane insulation , and a narrow ring spacing seems most promising .    2.385625546836891
( 3 ) amplifier design : for atrial sensing in vdd systems , bipolar sensing , differential amplifier , high sensing impedance ( > = UNK ) , and a wide bandpass filter ( e . g . , 10 - UNK ) should be realized .    2.6843401001036167
especially the inclusion of a relatively low frequency range ( 10 - UNK ) is important , because compared to a fixed atrial electrode , a higher quantity of the atrial signal sensed by a floating electrode is in the low - frequency range .    2.731201113258941
( 4 ) implantation : to choose the best fitting electrode , a preoperative assessment of the size of the right cardiac cavities should be performed .    2.820834813372584
a position of the ring electrodes in the mid - to - high right atrium parallel to the lateral wall should be the goal .    2.9180523967438017
correct interpretation of the sensed p wave amplitude and prediction of sufficient sensing after connection with the pacemaker is only possible with exact knowledge of the measurement technique of the intraoperative pacing system analyzer and the connected permanent pacemaker device ( bandpass filter , signal peak - to baseline or peak - to - peak ) .    2.0748624544432523
attention should be paid to the fixation of the electrode at the site of insertion to avoid postoperative dislocation of the ring electrodes .    2.589628464128072
knowledge of different electrode / pacemaker specific parameters and special aspects at implantation is a prerequisite for optimal function of vdd single - lead systems .    2.018189175470621
preoperatively , considerations should concern the choice of the electrode ( av distance , ring spacing ) and implantation strategy ( position close to or rather apart from the atrial wall ) .    2.2448936456218047
an atrial position may only be accepted if sufficient sensing can be documented with a measuring method similar to that of the implanted pacemaker .    2.3160135772686026
objectives : to investigate the agreement ( and its potential dependency on extravascular lung water ) between transpulmonary ( UNK ) and standard pulmonary artery ( paid ) thermodilution cardiac output measurements .    2.2702165106627263
in the industrial western world , 8 % of the population suffer from urogenital discomfort .    2.7879689378274097
epidemiologic studies show that the incidence rises with age .    3.0946271251189765
in light of the steadily increasing longevity in the female population , clinically manifested irregularities such as urogenital atrophy , recurrent urinary tract infections , UNK bladder , and incontinence pose a challenge to the attending physician .    1.919196426284898
to this day , urinary incontinence in later life is considered " normal " and " caused by old age . "    2.6717111839982675
however , among other age - related reasons , the main cause of this disorder is postmenopausal hormone deficiency .    2.5703624737447734
the present study gives an overview of the physiology of urogenital aging and the diagnostic and therapeutic means available to physicians to alleviate patients ' discomfort .    2.226016322646912
recurrent abdominal pain ( rap ) is one of the most common pain syndromes in childhood , with prevalence rates ranging from 10 to 20 % in all school - age children .    2.3384068925603576
in nearly 50 % the complaints persist over many years of their life - span to adolescence or adulthood .    1.9706281486364567
although the empirical findings have increased in the last decade , our knowledge about the etiology , pathogenesis , and pathophysiology is still very limited .    2.678123673387269
current approaches suggest that we understand recurrent pain syndromes as a complex and multidimensional disturbance ( UNK paradigm ) .    2.051525825303849
in this respect there is strong evidence for the major importance of psychosocial causes ( daily UNK , specific life events ) , psychopathological factors ( anxiety , depression , somatization disorder ) , and social environmental influences ( mother ' s psychopathology , social modelling , reinforcement ) in the pathogenesis of functional abdominal pain .    2.2005174470198128
the noticeable correlation with other pain syndromes and functional disturbances indicates that recurrent pain may possibly be a manifestation of a basic somatization disorder .    2.214806754750241
the unfavourable long - term prognosis supports the need for early and specific interventions .    2.749702354763891
psychological treatment requires a medical examination to exclude organic origins .    2.42106429667366
some of these invasive diagnostic procedures can be very difficult , expensive and distressing for the child .    2.3075894886171877
behavioural medicine is based upon having an extensive family history and symptom analysis .    2.3960613835857525
the psychological interventions applied in clinical practice include prophylaxis , reduction of pain symptoms and environmental modification .    2.30686776539352
in recent years there has been an increasing trend to create more complex and multidimensional behavioural treatment programs for children .    1.9551243854396267
although preliminary data on the use of these behavioural medicine programs have shown some promise , further investigations are needed to examine the applicability and effectiveness of specific interventions in the treatment of abdominal pain symptoms .    2.851526569071602
dermatologic disorders of the stump in patients with a leg amputation may have characteristic pathophysiologic and clinical features .    3.025367660823663
a knowledge of these factors may lead to earlier diagnosis and avoid immobilization .    2.846782549664189
there ist no german language review of this aspect of dermatology .    2.238092827799196
after providing an overview of the problem , including a discussion of prostheses , we review the following problems : mechanically induced blisters , follicular keratoses , epidermoid cysts , stump edema syndrome , UNK ( pseudo - kaposi sarcoma ) and verrucous hyperplasia .    2.2638641027532898
secondary aortoenteric fistulas are a well - known complication after open repair of an abdominal aortic aneurysm .    2.4405124174455386
this is the first case description of an aortoenteric fistula after endoluminal treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm .    2.3327028207336773
preoperative diagnosis by UNK UNK established infection of the protheses .    3.009179780027283
the problem was solved by closing the defect of duodenum , removing the UNK and in situ reconstruction with UNK .    2.4528484568704103
concepts in the treatment of craniomaxillofacial fractures have changed over the last 15 years .    2.953583925096858
modern imaging techniques have become a central part in establishing a proper diagnosis .    2.4516432754010684
advanced life support and intensive care medicine allow for early primary fracture treatment .    2.568006799837477
the former principles of minimal exposure of bone fragments using small incisions have been replaced by principles from reconstructive craniofacial surgery comprising extensive subperiosteal dissection , exposure of all fracture lines , open reduction and rigid internal fixation .    1.872825469483577
missing bony structures are replaced primarily by autogenous bone grafts .    2.3105828454130872
using these concepts , most late esthetic and functional sequelae of facial fractures can be diminished remarkably .    2.1281461537029047
in a 20 - year period ( 1974 - 1993 ) , UNK patients underwent surgery of the gallbladder .    3.181709046185268
acute cholecystitis was the indication for emergency laparotomy in UNK patients ( 20 , 5 % ) .    3.0359930254535157
retrospective analysis demonstrated that after adjustment for age , sex , and mode of surgery - elective versus emergency - advanced age is not a risk factor contributing to mortality in uncomplicated cases of emergency surgery .    2.1419233403475144
cases of acute cholecystitis complicated by perforation , peritonitis , and / or the presence of concrements in the biliary duct are associated with an increased mortality , however .    2.8578811587866624
we were able to demonstrate that advanced age is a risk factor in complicated cases and contributes to increased post - surgical mortality .    2.2770801890545243
the clinical effect of UNK radiation on ocular UNK is controversial not only because of the variety of treatment modalities .    2.6816366184243567
the aim of our study was to investigate an experimental model which allows to evaluate radiation parameters and to study the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on neoangiogenesis .    2.301835067641628
we report on a 59 - year - old woman patient with selective iga deficiency and familial hypercholesterinaemia .    2.1550318627058007
to lower elevated ldl levels in the patient ' s blood , immunoadsorption therapy with sheep - anti - human polyclonal antibodies coupled to sepharose columns was administered .    2.1365965230411916
during the procedure , the patient developed an anaphylactic shock requiring intensive care treatment .    3.083018803800995
a nationwide survey was performed to evaluate the significance of knee replacement ( endoprosthesis ) in germany .    2.817074614429862
all orthopaedic , traumatologic and general surgeons were asked about their preferred surgical techniques , favourite types of prosthesis and related issues .    1.9892879454581358
UNK prostheses have been increasingly preferred to constrained prostheses in the last few years .    2.2899234209141857
unicompartmental prostheses as well as constrained prostheses and high tibial osteotomies are still chosen for special cases .    2.543418810111511
revisions were most commonly due to patella problems .    2.482535569959276
patella replacement is popular to prevent this problem .    2.4840568386835016
endoprosthetic knee surgery receives as much UNK among german surgeons as endoprosthetic hip surgery .    2.0214347918534568
an important problem is the increasing costs of the method .    2.7598238831843007
chronic pulmonary hypertension and septic lung failure display different clinical features resulting in severe disturbances in the pulmonary circulation .    2.2301812239818433
in these diseases , the pulmonary UNK is impaired by a pathologic constriction of blood vessels that may lead to right ventricular UNK as well as serious worsening of gas exchange mainly caused by ventilation / perfusion mismatch .    2.602624478074457
various mechanisms deteriorating the vascular function may induce both an irreversible and a reversible contraction of pulmonary vessels , respectively .    1.933793130520498
two pharmacological approaches exist to reduce the vascular resistance : .    2.683828588497387
objective : to examine mortality , mobility , pain , UNK rates six month after hip fractures .    2.3042153049873764
lateral acetabular osteotomy in comparison to three - dimensional osteotomies of the pelvis in hip dysplasia is a simple technical procedure .    2.7996105844071923
contraindications are an age over 8 years and an irreducible femoral head .    2.2400448455757695
for a long time we have used UNK UNK bone wedges from animals .    2.4816583100639806
we now use autoclaved and deep - frozen wedges from allogenic femoral heads .    2.1521274088747537
the wedges are UNK at 121 °c for 20 min and then kept deep - frozen in the bone bank .    2.249988299617642
our results in 109 patients show that this method is very successful ; even extreme angles of acetabular index correction are possible with this technique .    2.1037652139978897
it is UNK that the lateral UNK with autoclaved allogenic bone graft is not used frequently and we recommend that this method be installed at all paediatric orthopaedic hospitals .    2.0861298128487817
there are only few publications about the effect of music therapy on pain relief .    2.7007963244868707
the clinical parameters of each patient were related to the observations in the audio - and video - documented music therapy settings and to the self - reported changes in pain intensity and pain behaviour .    2.3771189304188516
the influence of music therapy could be even better demonstrated in the systematic analysis of the single cases by individual profiles .    2.641447980260858
active music therapy affects especially the communicative and emotional dimension of chronic pain .    2.2725266728596454
psychophysiological and psychodynamic models are presented to explain the effectiveness of music therapy on pain reduction .    2.731313579825272
clinical studies on music therapy as well as on other " art therapies " should relate the analysis of clinical parameters to the descriptive - UNK documentation of the therapeutic process to demonstrate systematically the influence of music and art in the individual case .    2.547133342746967
background : retrospective analysis to assess the value of the sequential arginine - insulin - test ( UNK ) in the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency ( UNK ) .    3.0902666441777447
case report : the case of a 57 - year - old woman is reported who was admitted for peripheral UNK .    2.703767845904217
auditory similarities in voices of monozygotic twins have already been described in the literature .    2.4383389683033942
however , is there a clinical relevance ?    2.7826065689955914
thus , the present study was designed to identify parameters of vocal performance and acoustic features which are significantly more similar in monozygotic twins than in non - related persons .    2.334633490267204
in our hypothesis , comparable prerequisites for an increased vocal load in a profession or in an UNK education of the voice could be due to these similarities .    2.242640313396686
we compared intra - pair differences with data from a control group .    2.4085316786690587
moreover , we examined the correlation of intra - pair differences with the age of the monozygotic twins .    2.811715160274711
a greater difference in older twin pairs than in younger pairs could show the effect of an UNK influence .    2.4433214074971543
in addition to the few UNK studies in twins in the literature , we used current methods for acoustic analysis .    2.6030709703083867
we examined seven parameters of vocal performance and three acoustic features in 31 monozygotic twin pairs ( median age 36 years , range 18 - 75 years ) and compared them with 30 control group pairs , which consisted of non - related persons of the same age and sex , newly combined from the group of monozygotic twins ( " statistical twins " ) .    2.1950034893012873
we found significant differences in seven of ten parameters ( vocal range , highest and lowest vocal fundamental frequency , fundamental speaking frequency , maximum voice intensity , number of UNK , UNK of intensity ; u - test by mann - whitney ) .    2.3417682411837437
no correlation of the differences of the identical twins with age was found in the examined parameters .    2.8320226077591784
the voices of identical twins are significantly more similar than those of non - related persons regarding the above mentioned features .    2.4363781508538978
thus , the suitability of the voices of monozygotic twins for professions with a high demand on voice is comparable .    2.267791030339129
results of the group comparison correlate largely with the literature .    2.9146851407519314
the missing correlation with age could be due to the fact that the environmental effects were not measurable , and / or the development of the voice is more influenced by genetic effects .    2.800497054312592
after > 10 000 treatments - our hm3 / 4 and UNK UNK have been replaced by the siemens lithostar multiline .    2.4175624310689336
as a eswl center with eswl as the primary treatment indication for all types of stones in kidney and ureter we report our initial experience with this new UNK UNK .    2.1647711600995154
the system consists of an electromagnetic shock - wave UNK ( focus 80 x 5 mm ) and a digital fluoroscopy unit .    2.439817275056384
stone localization is achieved in a - 10 ° and + 30 ° position without movement of the patient .    2.2669678835461777
the treatment table itself allows most UNK and percutaneous auxiliary procedures .    2.2126541014982157
additionally , an UNK UNK ultrasound is available .    2.96449166264748
the mean stone diameter was 10 . 3 ( 2 - 20 ) mm with 53 % ureteral and 47 % renal stones .    2.2182336080362974
stone localization was achieved after 5 ( 1 - 39 ) min ( mean fluoroscopy time 3 . 1 ( 0 . 5 - 16 . 2 ) min ) .    2.930048587450645
in 92 . 7 % no analgesic premedication was done .    2.9110601681707875
44 % received 8 . 1 ( 2 - 15 ) mg piritramid intravenously .    2.7740549638215692
epidural anesthesia was performed in only 2 . 3 % for a second treatment .    3.405595330931693
95 % of the patients had complete stone disintegration .    3.368710497357173
in 68 % disintegration was achieved in one session .    2.784028085619608
eswl was repeated for further disintegration in 18 . 5 % , because of an unsuccessful treatment in 11 . 5 % and because of technical interruption of the previous session in 2 . 5 % .    3.019638638154167
we saw UNK haematomas in 2 % .    2.409340850725138
auxiliary procedures following eswl were necessary in only 9 . 2 % of the patients .    2.744216395023756
in situ eswl with the new lithostar multiline seems to be as effective as the UNK hm3 / 4 .    2.8202800796901277
analgesia - free treatment was performed in more than 50 % of the patients .    2.907007587179306
auxiliary procedures were less frequently necessary as compared to our previous experience with in situ eswl .    2.707681033971482
we report on a UNK frequent referral of former preterm babies with respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) infection and subsequent ards in our hospital during the UNK 1994 / 95 with regard to the clinical course under application of alternative treatment modalities .    2.1168792079857113
treatment modalities like inhalational UNK , use of UNK and instillation of surfactant had been tried without success .    2.587309610192372
all children ( age : 1 - 43 months ) were ventilated for 6 . 6 ( 1 - 17 ) days with fio2 = 1 . 0 and a mean airway pressure of 16 . 4 ( 10 - 24 ) cm h2o .    2.694190292713681
mean arterial blood gases were 49 ( pao2 ) and 41 ( pco2 ) mm hg , the UNK was 33 . 4 .    2.6037479308514686
by inhalational no in combination with UNK or hfov 4 patients could be stabilized , in the other 6 ecmo became necessary .    3.0284551577106384
two of them died in spite of several weeks on ecmo ; 8 children survived and could be discharged home after a mean hospital stay of 3 months .    2.332957110942018
even in very severe cases of rsv infection treatment modalities like no , hfov and ecmo can be used successfully .    2.336071931595569
the use of these treatment modalities must be considered before the lung damage is irreversible ; in those cases a pre - existing bpd is no contraindication even for extracorporeal lung support .    2.2700825183597266
the vascular organization of human spermatic cord was analyzed by means of injection and by casting preparation of the testicular artery and veins of the UNK plexus after UNK .    2.7615424880659725
after leaving the human testis , the testicular veins are organized in two main groups and form two vein plexus .    1.9986908661594323
one of these vein groups forms a tight plexus around the testicular artery .    2.153259979153959
computer - aided 3 - d reconstructions based on the paraffin serial sections of the human spermatic cord allowed us to demonstrate the relation between the blood vessels and the other tissue structures of the spermatic cord .    2.870094504618683
the results obtained allowed us to UNK the human spermatic cord into three compartments .    2.748099166752914
the UNK compartment contains the vas UNK and its blood vessels .    2.4440426551612746
the middle compartment contains the testicular artery and the vein group which forms a tight plexus around this artery .    2.293366091949279
the UNK compartment contains a vein group which shows no topographic relation to the testicular artery .    2.3417562876416884
this vein group is embedded in a large , macroscopically visible volume of fatty tissue .    2.215898608290122
to be sure of sparing the testicular artery during antegrade sclerotherapy this vein group should be prepared .    2.0822598712787923
it has known for a long time that sydenham ' s chorea and tics , as seen in UNK de la UNK ' s syndrome ( gts ) , are UNK very similar .    2.2838250430844127
investigations of children suffering from gts , including obsessive - UNK symptoms , have provided signs of a UNK autoimmune process but also shown that treatment based on immunological interventions has been effective .    2.25425543626581
we treated a 14 - year - old boy showing all diagnostic criteria of gts , familial susceptibility , and an increase in the antibody titer of streptococcal antigens with UNK immunoglobulins i . v .    2.3133974670980786
response to this therapy was good regarding motor tics , vocal tics , and behavioral symptoms such as disturbed impulse control which still persisted after 9 months .    2.0021848180831987
these findings and the successful therapy underline reports of the literature and point to a pathogenetic mechanism of an immunologically triggered disturbance of the striatal dopaminergic system , at least in a subgroup of gts .    2.3582063631438417
we report on three cases with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura ( itp ) and insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( iddm ) or UNK .    2.132355345168959
all three patients suffered from autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type ii .    2.4104902833988953
among our patients with isolated iddm ( about 250 patients ) no case of itp was seen .    2.2734446005015494
therefore we recommend that all patients with chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura and insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus should be carefully monitored for other diseases associated with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type ii .    2.2934988024880467
the high rate of coronary artery disease ( cad ) mortality needs preventive intervention .    2.5901899043184335
several studies have documented the effectiveness of ldl - cholesterol lowering in cad primary prevention .    2.5621607018838257
the west of scotland prevention study resulted in risk reduction by about one third through ldl - cholesterol lowering .    2.0727320319883185
the data indicate that specifically patients at high risk benefit from lipid reduction .    2.371029957048056
high risk patients have besides high ldl - cholesterol one or more additional risk factors such as family history of premature coronary artery disease , hypertension , smoking , low hdl - cholesterol or diabetes .    2.3786026810420458
therapy primarily aims at life style changes , UNK of smoking and weight reduction as well as dietary changes to achieve ldl - cholesterol levels of 115 - 175 mg / dl ( 3 - 4 . 5 mmol / l ) , depending on the individual risk constellation .    2.7348598033507976
this strategy allows to reduce the number of patients needed to treat in order to prevent one cad event ( 56 in isolated hypercholesterolemia ) to 14 - 24 in high risk persons , approaching the number ( n = 13 ) known for effective lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease .    2.301355644205476
one hundred and three cases of spitz nevi were reviewed .    2.697696591243085
36 % of these patients were adults .    3.6205213895565147
the lesions in children occurred primarily on the face and secondarily on the trunk followed by the extremities .    2.6598075798140726
in adults , they affect the legs in women , and the trunk in men as does malignant melanoma .    2.580149418698665
clinically they were diagnosed more frequently as spitz nevi in children and adolescents than in adults .    2.3345574099732307
spitz nevi were most commonly mistaken clinically for " common " melanocytic nevus , hemangioma , verruca , fibrous histiocytoma , molluscum contagiosum , granuloma pyogenicum , UNK , and melanoma .    2.072690664197087
histologically , there are various expressions of spitz nevi , but they are usually compound melanocytic nevi with little pigmentation and typically large spindle - and / or epithelioid melanocytes .    2.3248943009773115
there are only small histopathological differences between spitz nevi in childhood and adulthood : one important feature rarely seen in spitz nevi of adults is multiple mitotic figures at the UNK - epidermal junction but rarely at the base of the melanocytic nevus .    2.1195900523421147
nevus UNK is considered to possibly be a distinctly pigmented variant of spitz nevus .    2.507072004337548
a few months ago an endovascular implantable ptfe stent graft became commercially available .    2.1090196038045588
since may 1998 we have treated 15 patients with extensive vascular occlusion at the femoropopliteal level .    2.3960903656403407
the implantation is carried out via a single inguinal approach in combination with conventional vascular surgical techniques like UNK UNK of the superficial femoral artery , local tea and patch - grafting of the femoral bifurcation , angioplasty , local lysis , etc .    2.512307624176245
the self - expanding thin - walled ptfe stent prothesis appears to be a viable alternative to the femoropopliteal p1 bypass and can be performed under local anesthesia , percutaneously or through a small inguinal incision .    2.490840384020199
the implantation can be carried out with minimal tissue trauma .    2.787345314234524
radiological and orthopaedic outcome in severe and moderate haemophilia a and b patients undergoing long - term prophylactic treatment were prospectively investigated focusing on the age of onset of prophylaxis and the number of joint bleedings prior to treatment .    2.6076722536238317
we report on 21 patients with severe and moderate haemophilia a and b receiving prophylactic treatment of between 3 . 1 and 16 . 1 years duration .    2.5691723097540793
in group i ( n = 8 ) prophylactic treatment was initiated in the first 2 years of life .    3.0680017227765997
patients of group ii ( n = 6 ) received prophylaxis at the age of 3 - 6 years .    2.9532318469038947
late - onset or secondary prophylactic treatment was started at the age of 6 years and above in 7 patients ( group iii ) .    2.7183931902784515
all patients received virus - UNK f viii or f ix concentrates at dosages of 30 - 40 iu , in some cases up to 50 iu / kg body weight i . v . three times per week for those with haemophilia a and twice per week for those with haemophilia b . elbow , knee and ankle joints were investigated at 3 - 4 yearly intervals according to the radiological and orthopaedic scores recommended by the world federation of haemophilia ( UNK ) .    2.1374964636818197
the total number of joint bleedings before and after start of prophylaxis were recorded in all patients .    2.735772368186485
in group i 7 out of 8 patients had unaffected joints with constant radiological and orthopaedic scores of zero or 1 , after a median of 11 . 25 years of prophylactic treatment .    2.1839142833714513
one patient in this group demonstrated mild radiological alterations ( score 4 ) .    2.4889806404823744
patients of group ii showed neither radiological nor orthopaedic alterations at study entry .    2.1648795565414076
worsening joint scores could be detected despite ongoing prophylaxis after the 3 - year interval ( median orthopaedic score 4 , median radiological score 8 ) .    2.229376427633264
treatment group iii already showed considerable joint damage at study entry with a median radiological score of 11 ( 0 - 33 ) and a median orthopaedic score of 4 ( 0 - 11 ) .    2.3792109120314966
despite prophylactic treatment both , orthopaedic ( median 8 , range 2 - 12 ) and radiological scores ( median 19 . 5 , range 2 - 47 ) deteriorated after 3 years .    2.312580568253752
prior to onset of prophylaxis no or only one joint bleeding occurred in treatment group i .    2.367913057583199
in group ii , a median of 6 joint bleeds ( range 1 - 8 ) were reported before prophylaxis was started .    2.4891529495401685
patients of group iii usually experienced a median of more than 10 joint haemorrhages ( range 6 - 10 or more ) .    2.555947688909682
under prophylactic treatment the number of joint bleedings decreased significantly in groups ii and iii .    2.782843031305201
however , radiological and orthopaedic scores increased as a sign of progressing osteoarthropathic alterations in patients reporting more than 6 joint haemorrhages before onset of prophylaxis whereas no joint alterations could be assessed in patients with no or only one joint bleeding episode prior to prophylaxis .    2.274921576362615
even a small number of joint bleedings seems to cause irreversible osteoarthropathic alterations leading to haemophilic arthropathy .    2.2316477687918277
once apparent , further progression of joint damage could not be arrested despite of prophylactic treatment ( group ii and iii ) .    2.525350194757009
in order to prevent haemophilic arthropathy , effective prophylaxis should be started before or at least after the first joint bleeding in severe haemophilia a and b .    2.317709487401331
the hemodynamic treatment of septic shock consists of fluid repletion , maintenance of an adequate cardiac output , and restoration of mean arterial pressure .    2.232339619110953
norepinephrine is a potent UNK that can be considered when the patient is adequately fluid resuscitated , when cardiac output is greater than 3 . 5 l / min / m2 ( or sv o2 > = 65 % ) and when blood pressure remains low .    2.7009281390316966
the objective is to achieve and maintain a mean arterial pressure of 60 - 70 mmhg , or more in some patients ( older or hypertensive patients ) .    2.203411189134997
renal effects of norepinephrine were evaluated in several studies ; urine output , creatinine clearance , and osmolar clearance are significantly increased .    2.2328872981972063
the effect on oxygen transport is unpredictable .    2.403171155234378
the effects on lactate concentrations were poorly evaluated , but several studies suggest that the drug does not worsen and can even improve tissue oxygenation of septic shock patients .    2.1807368201268837
provided that cardiac output is maintained , treatment with norepinephrine is without negative effects on splanchnic tissue oxygenation .    2.3130781835075043
in conclusion , the clinical experience with norepinephrine strongly suggests that this drug can successfully increase blood pressure without deteriorating cardiac output and organ function .    2.1315787073445627
whether using norepinephrine in septic shock patients effects mortality as compared to dopamine or epinephrine still requires a prospective study .    2.304415473621955
is it possible to find a correlation between the localisation of UNK and the localisation and extension of the retinal ischemia ?    3.476694457102168
ischemia was recognized not as capillary non - perfusion but as impaired retinal perfusion .    2.0913859075232484
elderly patients with known episodes of atrial arrhythmia and indication to pacemaker therapy are borderline cases relative to selection of ventricular single - chamber or dual - chamber pacemaker .    2.2455707029537795
the frequency of recurrence of arrhythmic episodes under dual - chamber pacemaker therapy is there the most important criterion .    2.5513716919050267
the differences between patients prone to paroxysmal atrial tachyarrhythmia ( atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter ) and patients without atrial tachyarrhythmia in their medical history were investigated .    2.134096615035791
frequency of recurrence of atrial fibrillation / flutter and the rate of successful therapy after implantation of a dual chamber pacemaker were studied .    2.84309776624206
the long - term history of 39 patients with known intermittent or UNK successfully treated episodes of atrial fibrillation / flutter was compared with 24 patients with new atrial tachyarrhythmia after pacemaker implantation .    2.3292413559494913
there was no significant difference in the frequency of recurrence and in therapy efficiency of atrial tachyarrhythmia between both groups .    2.536558727212364
the results show the benefit of implanting a dual chamber pacemaker also for patients with a known history of atrial tachyarrhythmia .    2.724239121798732
it therefore , should be postulated for therapy of those patients .    2.8469397326655455
although the risks and side effects of blood transfusions have been significantly reduced during the past years , the potential infectious and immunologic side effects still require a clear and restricted indication before each transfusion is performed .    2.4005255425206213
however , the transfusion errors before and during administration of blood components nowadays represent the highest risk in particular for critical care and high risk patients .    2.2916253822084856
this article focuses on the specific problems of handling , preparation , and practical performance of transfusions .    2.3453419645372646
some practical aspects and problems of transfusions are examplary shown for intensive care and high risk patients , such as immunosuppressed , transplanted or UNK patients and critical care premature neonates .    2.4064932190610078
vincent ' s angina ( UNK - vincent ) is the most prominent disease caused by coinciding infections from UNK and UNK both belonging to obligate anaerobic bacterias .    2.71738766237444
a possible symbiotic infection of both UNK may become manifest on the mucous membranes of the oral cavity and the oropharynx beside the UNK .    2.1805818108813106
the clinical outcome may be different and pose difficulties in the differential diagnosis .    2.5118054504709617
we report the case of a 29 year old female patient with necrotizing UNK of the soft palate suspicious for stomatitis ulceromembranacea .    2.70094480700866
in case necrotizing inflammations of the oral cavity area were to be found infections due to anaerobic bacterias should be considered mostly occuring as mixed infections .    2.269890824928746
the correct identification by cultivation UNK out to be difficult in that it requires special conditions .    2.3763916343942415
furthermore , reliable detection of these bacterias necessitates careful collection and transport of patients specimens .    2.1688888842568317
in case of UNK ( UNK ) a specimen should be prepared for microscopic examination beside setting up a special culture .    2.82925412709195
this is because the staining is the most suitable procedure for UNK identification to support the clinical diagnosis of stomatitis ulceromembranacea .    2.639559655381833
quantitative tissue doppler echocardiography is a new diagnostic approach to left ventricular systolic performance .    2.720942355476021
the aim of the present study was to validate a recently developed method based on the computer software tdi - labor enabling a variable time and space related measurement of regional wall velocity from tissue doppler images .    2.013511993251963
therefore , in 63 volunteers the mean velocity of a 2 mm thick subendocardial slice during the systolic ejection period was determined from frozen doppler m - mode images of the left ventricular posterior wall obtained using the left UNK window .    2.100046853561609
the same images were employed for comparative measurement of the mean endocardial velocity using the conventional m - mode slope approach .    2.321408017102429
tissue doppler data of the subendocardial wall velocity were found to correspond closely to the mean endocardial wall velocity ( y = 0 . UNK + 0 . 17 ; r = 0 . 77 ; p < 0 . 0001 ) .    2.393307983137878
the average wall motion gradient of the population was 1 . 33 + / - 0 . 35 .    2.9968004121660274
wall motion velocity and wall motion gradient were shown to be not age dependent .    2.4329393522078644
UNK , the profession of geriatric nurse has arisen from the care of the sick and has developed very differently from region to region .    2.1384463467985717
if experts in that field focus too long on such matters , there is a danger that decisive developments in the profession of geriatric nurse take place outside their field of vision .    2.0866548597631227
it is reported about the recent detection of not yet compensated victims of forced sterilisation during the third reich .    2.0018647245283963
the author describes the current state of compensation practice .    2.5942875195305732
from a global viewpoint , tuberculosis is one of the most important infectious diseases of our time .    2.5164859345129758
the situation in germany , as in most comparable industrialized nations , is stable .    2.5835522843479377
the UNK trend of previous years continued in 1997 , when 11 , 163 people developed active tuberculosis - an incidence of 13 . 6 / 100 , 000 .    2.169537674894708
however , the tuberculosis problem cannot be restricted to one country , and germany is particularly affected by trends in eastern europe and in the former UNK countries .    2.2422657700015622
these countries experienced a marked increase of tuberculosis cases and resistant strains during recent years , a tendency which can only be UNK by fast , well - aimed and efficient action in the affected areas .    2.3831482576683234
the industrialized nations in particular should consider financial and logistic contributions as their duty .    2.038479254533656
crucial for control of the tuberculosis situation within each country are registration and close observation of epidemiological trends , identification of high - risk groups , and continuation of established tuberculosis control measures .    2.152615634308109
we report about a 61 years old patient , who suffered a rare ulnar dislocation of the UNK after being arrested by the police .    2.9542866117626074
we report on the eighth known case of a mature metastasis of a mature teratoma of the testis .    2.5009845045115373
in a 19 - year - old patient who had undergone a pyeloplasty of the left renal pelvis 6 years before , a mature metastasis of an occult mature teratoma of the testis was found at the former operation site .    2.3153120084702556
this case - in addition to those published previously - emphasizes the fact that a mature teratoma of the testis has to be regarded as a malignant tumor in adults .    2.725771774834946
it is supposed that the mature teratoma originates , as other testicular tumors , from carcinoma - in - situ - cells , which are responsible for metastasize and are not detected after lysis .    2.312256654856746
angiofibromas are usually characterized by their UNK in adolescent males with a typical localization and involvement of the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx .    2.3646864775703147
even the suspicion of an UNK angiofibroma or an angiofibroma in young children must be viewed in general with UNK , although reports of angiofibromas with atypical localizations and manifestations in young children have appeared in the literature .    2.2719687102409134
three cases of this fibro - vascular neoplasm with manifestations in the first decade of life and atypical localizations are presented : ( 1 ) an angiofibroma medial to the left lacrimal sac in a 15 - month old boy , ( 2 ) a right paranasal localization in a 9 - year - old boy and ( 3 ) an angiofibroma limited to the right UNK sinus in a 6 - year old boy .    2.7058356670538943
according to the literature and based on our own experiences with typical histological findings in all three cases , the clinician has to be aware that the rare angiofibroma can occur in pre - adolescent children with atypical localizations .    2.8352936767737607
the endonasal surgical approach is without any doubt the least traumatic one and in selected cases allows resection of a circumscribed tumor considering functional and aesthetic aspects .    2.1196909931113717
objective : chronic recurrent abdominal pain in childhood is frequently due to a helicobacter pylori - associated gastritis .    2.5857050134138375
the diagnosis should be verified either by gastric biopsy culture or by histological investigations of the gastric mucosa in children .    2.2292354132586403
the purpose of the present study was to UNK whether an elisa for helicobacter pylori has an adequate predictive reliability with regard to the putative gastric histology in order to possibly prevent unnecessary biopsies and associated UNK .    2.3074444614331515
complete dislocated fractures of the thoracic spine may have no neurological deficits if separation is present in the middle of the dorsal column .    2.689379687340873
in this case there is no injury to the spinal cord , because the " saving fracture " of the vertebral arc prevents it .    2.9674558253829395
one case of a severe dislocated fracture at UNK - 12 is reported .    2.73928811778632
in practice , a complete set of x - rays should be done after high - speed trauma , even if no neurological deficit is present .    2.4969648691270723
the treatment is operative by open reduction and fusion from the ventral or dorsal column .    2.228143777351632
gamma - UNK acid ( ghb ) is a naturally occurring transmitter in the mammalian brain , related to sleep regulation and possibly to energy balance in UNK or hibernating animals .    2.2460696960886093
it has been used for almost 35 years as an intravenous agent for induction of anaesthesia and for long - term sedation .    2.749260336496421
its convincing pharmacological properties , without serious UNK effects on circulation or respiration , are compromised by its unpredictable duration of action .    2.13031619100186
this is not a major problem with long - term sedation during icu treatment .    2.9793488186669568
ghb has been used with good results for sedation of patients with severe brain injury , where it compares favourably with barbiturates .    2.6981059740216
in animal studies , it seems to possess a protective action against hypoxia on a cellular and whole organ level .    2.0799507935100525
however , in some experimental animals ghb has been shown to produce seizure - like activities , and the compound is being used to produce absence - like seizures .    2.483775572457848
ghb has been used in our icu for years to provide adequate sedation for patients under controlled ventilation or for patients UNK the respirator during spontaneous respiration .    2.129323366605926
no serious side effects were observed in these patients , while in some patients under haemodialysis UNK and metabolic alkalosis developed ; both were reversible after discontinuation of ghb and restriction of additional sodium input ( UNK , the commercially available ghb preparation in germany , contains 9 . 2 mmol sodium / g ; the daily dose averages 20 - 40 g ghb , i . e .    2.3368351071005065
in europe ultrasonography has displaced diagnostic peritoneal lavage ( UNK ) in the primary survey of polytraumatized patients with suspected abdominal trauma .    2.8655164839052776
hemodynamically unstable patients who are brought to the emergency room with blunt abdominal trauma will go directly to the operating room after a rapid ultrasonography examination with evidence of hemoperitoneum .    2.310860153602713
in hemodynamically stable patients , in addition to ultrasonography , computed tomography can be done .    3.001169342480892
this is especially efficient if evaluation with sonography is not completely possible or shows little pathology ( e . g .    2.05594541767085
small amounts of hemoperitoneum ) .    2.6302161611668247
we report on a posttraumatic aneurysm of the brachiocephalic trunk , something which is rather rare .    2.2093874582948847
the injury was caused by blunt chest trauma following a car accident .    2.3395612266796326
computed tomography could not find the brachiocephalic lesion .    2.388912197232084
even after the strengthening by the law of 1997 , the german criminal law regarding corruption is no obstacle for cooperation between medical research and industry .    2.2363975270615453
the injustice of corruption is an irregular exchange between performing one ' s duty and benefits .    2.2028843383836976
according to this , an enterprise may give funds to a scientist for research purposes if no counter performance exceeding the research is associated with this .    2.281707820096718
however , it makes a difference if the scientist has to show his appreciation by influencing economic decisions of the clinic in favor of the enterprise .    2.032627221985099
in case of such an injustice , it is , under the new law , no longer important if the benefit is destined for the scientist himself or for another person or organization .    2.2505572619997327
thus , it is in the interest of both research and industry to avoid the suspicion of corruption in the first place .    2.887826234895264
a prerequisite for this is the strict UNK of the legal and administrative regulations concerning projects UNK by third - party funds .    2.724544283974556
since the immune system plays an important role in the rejection of tumours , current tumour therapy includes UNK .    2.4623291468408417
this can be done by interleukin 2 ( il - 2 ) , which activates t and killer cells and induces lysis of the tumour .    2.595035367619965
because the intravenous application of il - 2 may have serious side effects , we treated two patients with peritumoral injections in a pilot study .    2.854821954242312
both patients suffered from multiple cutaneous metastases of melanoma .    2.653885336146742
a total of 31 and UNK iu recombinant il - 2 ( UNK ) respectively was injected in increasing concentrations in one metastasis of each patient .    2.6213038278771617
histologically , almost complete necrosis of the tumour was induced .    2.9094953121123215
in comparison with the control specimen , the t - cell - rich infiltrate increased intra - and , in particular , UNK .    2.807426819183773
while the ratio of helper to suppressor t cells remained unchanged , the proportions of nk cells , monocytes / macrophages and il - 2 - receptor - bearing cells increased .    2.338583522323483
this reaction was restricted to treated metastases .    2.4218656894932655
no clinical side effects or laboratory changes were registered apart from local erythema and swelling .    2.225673867682499
wear of the articulating components ( especially pe - uhmw ) of total hip endoprostheses is the most important technical factor limiting the functional lifetime .    2.3956849228761117
to minimize wear debris , ceramic heads , according to iso UNK ( al2o3 ) , have been used , from 1969 paired with al2o3 and since 1975 paired with pe - uhmw .    2.0871507270731597
al2o3 balls articulating with cups made from cfrp have been in clinical use since 1988 .    2.1219420480728757
laboratory experiments and in - vivo testing showed minimized wear debris and mild biological response to wear products using cfrp ( carbon fiber reinforced plastic ) instead of pe - uhmw as the cup material .    1.8552434314261197
the articulating surfaces of retrieved ceramic heads ( al2o3 - UNK ) and cementless cfrp cups ( carbon fiber reinforced plastic , UNK ) were compared using UNK measurement techniques , scanning electron microscopy ( sem ) and roughness measurements ( including advanced roughness parameters UNK or UNK according to iso UNK ) .    2.3789711672639626
altogether , the first results of the clinical study showed that the combination al2o3 - ball / cfrp - cup came up to the expected lower wear rates compared with the conventional combinations .    2.90755178366132
the wear rates are comparable with the combination al2o3 / al2o3 without the material - related problems of ceramic components in all ceramic combinations .    2.0974636950122427
two cases where dna typing has been carried out for stain analysis are described .    2.320017789681866
in both cases y chromosomal str systems have been used in combination with autosomal str systems .    2.791045079570411
in the first case the dna from the UNK of a female victim with skin particles of the male UNK was typed .    2.9153473817218147
the male dna in this mixture of male and female dna could be typed .    2.177220834957021
the excess of female dna in the samples did not UNK the pcr reaction of y - chromosomal systems .    2.315560820898632
in the second case several body parts could be identified to belong to a single male person .    2.1768519878697323
the typing of the suspect ' s dna did not give any information because of a family relationship .    2.415366644997153
different kinds of stains have been analysed with dys UNK i / ii , dys 390 , dys UNK , dys UNK dys UNK and UNK .    2.1670055709090534
two multiplex pcr reactions were carried out to UNK time and stain material .    2.5612147859960324
although the y - chromosomal systems are not as polymorphic as autosomal str systems the analysis of combined UNK can give additional information in forensic UNK .    2.259956129063557
in a prospectively designed randomized study , we compared the efficacy of sublingual nitroglycerine and intravenous enalaprilat in the out - of - hospital treatment of 46 hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema ( defined as UNK over both lungs and systolic blood pressure > 200 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure > 100 mg ) .    2.242958289331305
the out - of - hospital treatment consists of oxygen ( 6 UNK / min ) via a face mask , furosemide 80 mg i . v . , opioids 10 mg s . c . , and either sublingual nitroglycerine ( n = 23 ; initial dose : 0 . 8 mg ; repetitive application of 0 . 8 mg every 10 min until a cumulative dose of 3 . 2 mg ) or intravenous enalaprilat ( initial dose : 2 . 5 mg ; repetitive application of 2 . 5 mg every 30 min until a cumulative dose of 10 mg ) .    2.4482981504927994
the aim of the antihypertensive treatment was a reduction of systolic blood pressure below 160 mm hg and diastolic blood pressure below 90 mm hg until admission to the emergency department .    2.254312699022406
in the emergency room , an arterial and venous blood sample was taken to determine the respiratory ( po2 , pco2 ) and metabolic status ( ph value ; base - excess ; serum lactate ) of the patient .    2.3109982254677393
successful antihypertensive treatment was observed in 13 / 23 ( 57 % ) patients of the enalaprilat group and 15 / 23 ( 65 % ) patients of the nitroglycerine group ( p = 0 . 54 ) .    2.746937503461853
systolic and diastolic blood pressure on admission were similiar in both treatment groups ( systolic rr : enalaprilat : 179 [ 31 ] mm hg ; nitroglycerine : 184 [ 38 ] mm hg ; p = 0 . 59 ; diastolic rr : enalaprilat : 96 [ 14 ] mm hg ; nitroglycerine : 101 [ 14 ] mm hg ; p = 0 . 12 ) .    1.8253441649099296
no significant differences were observed between the enalaprilat and the nitroglycerine groups concerning respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission ( po2 : 67 [ 15 ] vs . 64 [ 17 ] mm hg ; p = 0 . 50 ; pco2 : 46 [ 9 ] vs . 47 [ 13 ] ; p = 0 . 75 ; ph value : 7 . 27 [ 0 . 12 ] vs . 7 . 27 [ 0 . 09 ] ; p = 0 . 98 ; be : - 4 . 2 [ 3 . 7 ] vs . - 5 . 7 [ 4 . 1 ] ; p = 0 . 23 ; lactate : 4 . 2 [ 3 . 3 ] vs . 4 . 2 [ 2 . 7 ] ; p = 0 . 98 ) .    2.3402021139235067
intravenous enalaprilat did not exhibit any advantage compared to nitroglycerine in terms of blood pressure reduction or respiratory and metabolic parameters on admission to the emergency room .    2.4555107494242034
we conclude that enalaprilat is no substitute for nitroglycerine in the out - of - hospital treatment of hypertensive patients with pulmonary edema .    2.0377666114539386
paragangliomas of the glomus UNK are relatively rare , but highly vascularized neoplasmas , which develop from UNK .    2.295015880969821
they can be develop at UNK , but most often in the third or fourth decade of life .    2.63615749180834
paragangliomas grow very slowly and are most always of benign origin .    2.1716921780422127
there is a familial predisposition , and an autosomal - dominant transmission is presumed .    2.6927958395263087
they are commonly located in the jugular region ; in rare cases a polytopic manifestation is found .    2.547354341954774
we describe the case of a 47 - year - old male patient who was referred to our department because of a progressive swelling of the neck on both sides .    2.9850889280415323
contrast - enhanced computed tomography had displayed soft tissue tumors in the jugular regions .    2.5548398098378082
we performed an operative exploration , which showed a highly vascularized tumor .    2.4531491834346872
histopathologic analysis revealed the diagnosis of a paraganglioma .    3.3038643382908575
an angiography of the neck and thoracic region , furthermore , revealed an additional paraganglioma in the anterior mediastinum .    2.4972485243914897
our case report demonstrates the rare polytopic manifestation of paragangliomas .    2.3815033330253748
this perivascular neoplasms have to be removed before haemodynamic complications develop .    2.6698511837618764
the extent of this tumors is clearly illustrated by use of an angiography .    2.5491363914063347
because of the familial predisposition , clinical and radiological examinations of relatives are mandatory .    2.629235618626242
in more than 30 years of development of intensive care medicine ( icm ) , our speciality has acquired moral and ethical UNK , although not without public pressure and discussions .    2.31358416047918
special UNK dealing , e . g . , with brain death , terminal care , ethics of foregoing life - sustaining treatment in the critically ill , withholding or withdrawing mechanical ventilation , and other issues have UNK formed in a number of medical societies .    2.3390628760546384
international consensus conferences have helped to clarify some of the issues .    2.5274222774948694
with increasing experience , a multitude of ethical problems have arisen in icm that have to be dealt with , such as the issue of quality of life .    2.567493028024721
what is an UNK life ?    3.1772784132888328
are we allowed to make UNK for our patients ?    2.464646971844739
what is cost - effectiveness in icm ?    2.851984289332854
other restrictions include bed and equipment shortages in the intensive care unit ( icu ) , the necessity for triage - undisputed in catastrophe medicine - and how one should proceed in managing elective patients ?    2.1326458281511456
in situations of limited icu bed availability , UNK patients will be admitted , sparing out patients who are less ill for observation and those with poor quality of life and poor prognosis .    2.4363394959876863
for the future , it will likely be necessary to define the patients who should be admitted to an icu more than those who should not be admitted .    2.694164887183465
an icu treatment UNK index would be directly proportional to the probability of successful outcome and the quality of the remaining life , and would be inversely related to costs for achieving success .    2.426016973237674
the icu outcome with survival , hospital mortality , and follow - up of icu patients is considered .    2.6040408379590967
UNK ( do not UNK ) , the dying patient , terminal care , terminal weaning - UNK ( do not treat ) - active and passive euthanasia , living UNK , quality of life , and cost - effectiveness for icu patients are defined .    2.513406442364276
their application in the icu will be discussed and problems pointed out .    2.7599447064045317
outcome predictions using scores ( apache iii , saps ii , mpm ) have been developed based on previous experience , but should only be applied to patient groups and for quality assurance in icus .    2.3293399242519754
the most frequent and difficult problem in the icu is the vegetative state , which requires an exact diagnosis .    2.4586855383383037
the differential diagnosis from other comatose states such as coma , brain death , and locked - in - syndrome is depicted .    2.315340404695784
the ethics of interrupting life - sustaining treatment in critically ill patients have been worked out by a task force on ethics of the society of critical care medicine ( 1990 ) .    2.230785804959173
a consensus was found that the patient may judge to forego therapy ; ethically it is then appropriate to withhold or UNK therapy .    2.323448329097326
according to the consensus , withdrawing an already initiated treatment should not necessarily be regarded as more problematic than a decision not to initiate treatment .    2.1178580527988915
in my mind , however , there is a great difference between withdrawing or withholding , e . g . , ventilation .    2.7084626703199395
a UNK opinion by some members of the task force stated that hydration and nutrition other than high - technology or parenteral nutrition are key components of patient care , and should not be equated with medical intervention .    2.112887640830502
the ethical problems associated with active euthanasia ( physician - assisted suicide or death ) as UNK in the netherlands are also discussed .    2.5814476948333973
in most countries this practice seems unacceptable .    2.267574522824626
from 30 years experience in icm , there are many more ethical questions and case reports without clear solutions .    2.322683339361045
care decisions for single patients in unacceptable situations should be made after medical evaluation by the UNK with the medical team and , if possible , by the patient and / or his or her UNK .    3.0474402200913544
legislation and solutions cannot be expected for single patients , but ethics committees could be helpful in decision - making .    2.3734925236120494
pseudarthroses of the spine are classified into congenital , acquired non - traumatic , posttraumatic and postoperative ( iatrogenic ) pseudarthroses .    2.252017401943388
the various types of non - unions of the spine are described according to their clinical and radiological appearance .    3.2033022956045363
in line with their clinical importance , special attention with respect to the operative treatment is given to non - union of the axis of c2 and to spondylolysis .    2.867666464235402
for the pseudarthrosis of the dens a posterior fusion according to gallie - brooks is recommended , in UNK without marked UNK a " direct repair " should be considered in young patients .    2.202799225558476
207 osteosarcomas were examined morphologically after neoadjuvant chemotherapy according to the UNK - 86 protocol using representative slides of one whole tumor plane .    2.4593181017630377
the rate of responders 63 % .    2.697154895211491
in relapse - free patients both the whole tumors and the vital areas there of were smaller than in patients with relapse during a follow - up period of 5 years .    2.5399314700189173
within the subgroup of osteoblastic osteosarcomas , metastases were observed following smaller tumors than in UNK osteosarcomas .    2.195316974290073
therefore , in addition to degree of regression , histological subtype and tumor size should be considered in the prognostic evaluation of osteosarcomas .    2.3426707014647463
the possibilities of using different material combinations for the replacement of knee joint endoprostheses are very limited .    2.2101238592201993
therefore , cobalt - UNK - UNK alloys are currently being used for femoral components and UNK - high molecular weight polyethylene for UNK stressed tibial components .    2.5002187189925644
titanium alloys can be considered for the tibial component only .    2.9246511243382693
the fixation of hamstring grafts in acl reconstruction requires a UNK device .    2.440912521250298
during the process of UNK the graft stability depends entirely on the fixation .    2.719091291490083
the following study focused on the mechanical conditions of no 6 ethibond , 5 mm mersilene tape and 5 mm polylene tape .    2.1805539965577334
the material were tested as loops with a length of 30 mm including the UNK similar to intraoperative conditions .    2.1076788412315395
the ultimate tension load and elongation of the conditioned and unconditioned loops were investigated under cyclic load of 50 n and 100 n using a tension load machine .    1.9154317363062465
the ultimate tension load increased significantly only for mersilene from UNK n to UNK n . however , the highest ultimate tension load showed polylene with UNK n . the oscillating load up to 100 n revealed for unconditioned loops and elongation of 4 . 1 mm for ethibond , 2 . 9 mm for polylene and 5 . 4 mm for mersilene .    2.3168162035368063
the elongation decreased significantly for the conditioned loops to a maximum of 1 . 4 mm .    2.6211245507047174
concerning the amplitude during the period of oscillating load there was found a significant reduction as well .    2.6553087092785654
based on our results polylene showed the best mechanical properties .    2.4901624473853508
regardless the intraoperatively used material we advocate the conditioning of the loops before anchoring the hamstring graft in acl reconstruction .    1.931464211405415
on the basis of the results of UNK knee arthroscopies in children aged between 2 and 17 years in the period from 1985 to 1995 we attempt to evaluate the current status of this procedure .    2.6750903464349345
arthroscopy as a diagnostic intervention in trauma with UNK or in any kind of knee effusion is progressively being replaced by sophisticated ultrasound techniques or mri .    2.234719227153047
taking our own " incorrect " clinical diagnoses as a starting point we look at common problems in the accurate clinical examination of the symptomatic knee in younger children .    2.0860872298820334
rational utilization of all kinds of modern diagnostic measures will reduce purely diagnostic arthroscopies in favour of therapeutic endoscopic interventions thus reducing perioperative risks to a minimum .    1.9761297624371168
the pathogenesis of cortical blindness as a rare complication in severe preeclampsia is still unclear .    2.483629015626397
the case of a women with postpartum blindness is reported in which ct and mri initially showed cortical and subcortical edema in the parieto - occipital lobes .    2.1972662533215086
at this time cerebral angiography and transcranial color - coded sonography ( tccs ) revealed widespread cerebral vasospasm .    1.9733602192769568
this case provides rare documentation that transient blindness in patients with preeclampsia may result from parieto - occipital ischemia due to cerebral vasospasm .    2.3639087324511907
in such patients tccs may be useful to detect vasospasm associated with preeclampsia / eclampsia .    2.2831225703142852
the principle of photodynamic therapy ( pdt ) for rheumatoid arthritis consists in specifically UNK a drug ( photosensitizer ) in the synovium .    2.279082122925253
subsequent activation of the photosensitizer by means of a laser leads to a cytotoxic effect .    3.256680816934926
the practicability of pdt was tested in an animal model of igg - induced arthritis in rabbits .    2.366991833713454
photosan - 3 , 5 - aminolevulinic acid and bpd - ma were administered intraarticularly or intravenously .    2.3819323155712966
in this model , concentration of the photosensitizer in the synovial lining cells , the lymphoid infiltrate , and the skin was seen .    2.771958113172347
after laser irradiation a selective demarcation and destruction of the synovium by prior administration of photosan - 3 , not constant by bpd - ma and without therapeutic effect by 5 - aminolevulinic acid , was observed .    2.0096620095673763
in contrast , bradytrophic tissues such as cartilage , meniscus , and ligament structures were changed neither macroscopically nor microscopically in all series .    1.801324878834974
pdt thus offers ideal preconditions for minimal invasive treatment of chronic inflammatory joint diseases because of its UNK and efficacy .    2.5145027787239216
photodynamic laser therapy can be considered a new method in the surgical treatment of inflammatory disease of the synovial membrane .    3.429125865329416
enlargement of the prostate is an age - related , physiological process that is unique in human tissue .    2.7405295948926596
the prostate gland is the most common site of neoplastic disorders in men .    2.8119554348634663
despite the growing impact of the various prostate diseases in terms of morbidity and mortality , the pathogenesis of benign prostate hyperplasia ( bph ) and prostate cancer remains poorly understood .    2.6766913413523064
this reflects the complex composition of the gland with different anatomic , cellular and functional compartments that are differentially involved in benign and malignant disease processes .    2.0278665783378207
the present review summarizes new concepts on the morphogenesis of normal and abnormal growth in the human prostate .    2.2996806428266803
there is increasing evidence that prostatic stem cells are located in the basal cell layer that is basically involved in normal growth and the development of glandular hyperplasia and prostate cancer .    2.388236966924871
high - grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia is considered the most likely precursor of clinically important cancer of the peripheral zone .    2.5950519865927673
severe differentiation and proliferation abnormalities occur during malignant transformation of the prostatic epithelium .    2.253675346143592
these premalignant changes are associated with abnormal expression of growth factor receptors , oncogene and suppressor gene products and genetic instability .    2.136946859022201
during the process of stromal invasion the transformed cells lose their basal cell phenotype and produce basement UNK - UNK - like matrices .    2.3877911463625368
common prostate cancer is mainly composed of exocrine cell types that remain androgen - responsive even in hormone - independent disease .    1.9883165330271646
the frequent occurrence of neuroendocrine differentiation in common prostate cancer reflects the differentiation potency of its stem cells .    2.0820616523328654
the endocrine phenotype UNK from exocrine tumor cells via intermediate ( UNK ) cell types .    2.5556953299584255
neuroendocrine tumor cells consistently lack the nuclear androgen receptor and represent an androgen - UNK cell population in prostate cancer .    2.133168208304128
questionnaires were mailed anonymously to 150 german shock wave centers .    2.1131293612477684
twenty questions addressed the following areas of interest : - facilities of the extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ( eswl ) center ( technical , personnel , laboratory , etc . )    1.9775186755760075
- cooperation at eswl center with referring urologists - laboratory facilities versus actual metabolic work - up .    2.024194248953789
the return rate was 114 of 150 ( 76 % ) .    2.191674841388319
surprisingly , at 58 % of the centers the average number of treatments is less than two per day .    2.6240134452423804
in 30 % of the centers only chemical stone analysis is done !    3.077776048815081
the final conclusion was that eswl has largely replaced the causal metabolic work - up and subsequent metaphylaxis as a symptomatic measure against urolithiasis .    2.0817821543492556
based on current insurance data patients with UNK can be expected to suffer reduced UNK .    2.8779136676430173
a prospective study was carried out to test this relationship .    3.241428817067365
in 1970 UNK and harms made fundamental recommendations for the night driving ability of UNK as well as for the corresponding examination methods .    2.4602198993607374
reduced night driving ability of persons over the age of 60 , as well the established limits for UNK vision and glare sensitivity , and their relevance to night - time collisions has been re - examined .    2.311739477038963
hernias of the obturator foramen are rare .    2.4944689435258556
they are described mostly in elderly female patients in poor health .    2.225340225611779
often the correct diagnosis is UNK upon as a result of surprising intraoperative findings .    2.8033657200628337
surgical therapy is indicated often by the clinical symptoms of an UNK hernia .    3.142149144394225
herniation of the entire urinary bladder with hemorrhagic infarction has never been described before .    2.4600176575972776
for an anatomical reduction of the hernia it was UNK to UNK the superior pubic ramus .    3.191036049636663
for plastic reconstruction a UNK mesh was used .    2.4130018641217825
acl reconstruction with patellar tendon graft has become a standard procedure .    2.7043905602703364
the graft can be inserted either using two UNK and a lateral femoral incision or with a femoral half tunnel drilled from the joint , thus avoiding the lateral incision .    2.4044937100496266
advantages of the single - incision technique in the early rehabilitation period have been claimed .    2.7433878171332062
40 patients with acl deficiency were included in a prospective randomized trial comparing single and two - incision technique with a follow - up period of 4 years .    2.64963398804136
preoperative data did not show any significant difference between the two groups .    2.56579081613982
at follow - up no differences were observed with respect to complications or the progress of rehabilitation .    3.148476254308713
evaluation after 1 and 4 years according to the ikdc form revealed good to excellent results in 70 % of all patients .    2.769956375033784
the tegner - score increased significantly , however most patients did not UNK their former activity level .    2.19436047915706
acl - reconstruction reduced anterior translation of the knee significantly at 6 months follow - up .    2.446785130059818
however , we observed a slight increase of anterior translation after 1 and 4 years in both groups ; stability was comparable in both groups at all time periods .    2.5680149889775348
we conclude that an arthroscopic UNK technique has no advantage compared to a mini - open two - incision technique for acl reconstruction with patellar tendon graft in terms of subjective or objective parameters .    2.205213637089334
for determining the prevalence of multiple sclerosis ( ms ) in germany , the outcomes of several epidemiological studies are available .    2.961558800236848
if these rates are transferred to germany as a whole , figures result of 67 , 000 to 138 , 000 ms patients in all .    2.009776962427583
the differing prevalence rates may be caused by various problems in finding patients , the epidemiological area , and different population structures .    2.4693004452706337
to avoid these difficulties , a new approach for calculating the number of patients with diagnosed ms was chosen based on representative samples taken from the groups of physicians involved in ms treatment .    2.5804855432712195
the disadvantage of this approach is that it does not allow any questioning of the diagnosis .    2.8827446277621447
UNK the results in this way and their subsequent compilation - taking " double treatments " into consideration - showed a total of 122 , 000 patients with diagnosed multiple sclerosis in germany .    2.4057556214658096
this figure corresponds to a prevalence rate of 149 . 1 per 100 , 000 inhabitants and is within the range found by UNK et al .    1.9825850295425618
[ 19 ] : 127 per 100 , 000 excluding the diagnostic category " possible multiple sclerosis " and 170 per 100 , 000 including it .    1.9856017468476035
glucuronides of the following UNK were synthesized : UNK , UNK - ethanol , UNK , isopropanol , butanol , UNK , r - ( - ) - 2 - butanol , s - ( + ) - 2 - butanol , UNK and s - ( - ) - 2 - UNK .    3.0731859028752777
the retention indices of acetyl , UNK ( UNK ) and UNK ( tms ) derivatives are given and discussed in relation to the chemical structures .    2.7127639933615644
mass spectra of homologous derivatives were shown to be very similar but some fragments were specific for the chain length of the alkyl UNK and can be used for identification and a quantitative estimation of glucuronides in urine samples .    2.3223174390352757
decreasing numbers of tuberculosis cases in the western countries have led to diminished attention towards this disease .    2.448173789428886
but worldwide , tuberculosis still is the leading cause of mortality due to any one single infectious agent .    2.3564616319188745
in the industrialized countries , immigration , growth of low - income groups and increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients , mainly due to the hiv epidemic , supply a reservoir for tuberculosis .    2.432835019312337
five efficient str systems were investigated by automated laser fluorescence analysis on an a . l . f .    2.0525961059100393
the system UNK and the combinations of the systems UNK / UNK and UNK / UNK in duplex reactions were analysed .    3.255653652135113
dna samples could be analysed with a high sensitivity ( 100 pg ) and the results were reproducible .    3.1467383002730838
no allele drop - out was observed .    2.4021661022241414
using specific UNK UNK , the inter and intra gel deviation was less than 0 . 5 bp .    3.218152938703899
the allele frequencies , the mean exclusion chance values and the discrimination power for all five systems are shown .    2.2856660963416506
the combination of the five systems resulted in a power of discrimination of 99 . UNK % .    2.4069810397158973
few technological developments have impacted health sciences over the last years like the internet .    2.4245235000569956
this comes at a time when electronic acquisition , storage and processing of medical data becomes commonplace in the so - called developed countries .    2.1600159467159137
new forms of integrated medical services will eventually evolve from these two trends .    2.118601846834512
for information taken from many medical resources on the internet a relative lack of review processes requires special care and selection .    1.9110654173325266
the co - operation of different health providers can be facilitated using technological standards initially established for other purposes .    2.115498480777545
this article is directed towards the gynecologist interested in practical use of the internet and its technologies and critically reviews the value of sample sites on the net .    2.273641282523776
the accompanying internet UNK lists relevant resources .    2.3295139453429896
a calculation model was developed for the cost of stone therapy and metaphylaxis in germany based on estimates of stone incidence , types and recurrence rates , actual costs for stone removal and metaphylaxis ( based on data from a district of the social health care system ) .    2.1499781546986583
there are 200 , 000 stone recurrences per year in germany .    2.306777249656487
cost for treatment of these stones amount to $ 687 , 000 , 000 .    2.713307739151187
stone metaphylaxis reduces the recurrence rate by some 40 % .    2.5204327499215022
the annual cost for stone removal could be lowered by $ UNK , 300 , 000 .    2.153941455509341
metabolic evaluation / metaphylaxis amount to $ 70 , 100 , 000 per year , resulting in an net saving of $ 205 , 200 , 000 .    2.260167812987286
in 1997 , there were 96 days off - work per stone patient resulting in 5 , 800 , 000 days off - work in germany per year .    2.0820787307437523
metaphylaxis in stone UNK can lower health care cost significantly .    2.2225877520007455
although health care conditions may vary from country to country , in principle this calculation model is applicable also to other countries .    1.9508215245240699
consideration of estrogen replacement therapy is well established in the treatment of postmenopausal syndrome and osteoporosis in menopause .    2.983054826277807
some observational epidemiologic studies on this topic have suggested beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease .    2.229451605362079
a prospective , controlled , randomized clinical trial with respect to cardiovascular events and mortality in postmenopausal hormone users , the UNK ( heart and estrogen / progestin replacement ) study has recently been published .    2.6405520101764957
antiischemic effects of estrogens are mediated by improvement of menopausal - associated endothelial dysfunction , calcium antagonism , and activation of endothelial synthesis of prostacyclin .    1.9702410918249151
improvement in functional state and reduction of stress - induced myocardial ischemia with hormone replacement therapy ( hrt ) have been demonstrated in several clinical trials .    2.5029929633721566
inflammatory stimuli induce the expression of adhesion molecules on leukocytes and endothelial cells .    2.4287406747950904
the adhesive forces between leukocytes and the vascular endothelium are antagonized by the shear stress of the UNK blood .    2.621983375843059
the aim of this study was to examine how differences in the apparent wall shear rate measured in iris venules with varying UNK affect leukocyte - endothelium interaction .    1.8604337529760275
radiologic means aid in assessment of the most suitable side for operation and allow the surgeon to be prepared for special situations in order to perform the operation without difficulties [ 22 ] .    2.777655123199319
the most suitable modalities are ct and mri preoperatively .    2.65970597242219
ct should only be performed if the patient complains of symptoms .    2.6941492328057444
systemic immunotherapy , notably with interleukin - 2 ( il - 2 ) and interferon - ( ifn ) , has yielded a response rate of 10 % to 30 % in UNK renal cell carcinoma .    2.5614974569198945
however , systemic immunotherapy is limited by severe side effects , and long - lasting response is rare .    2.8539399772701146
tumor palliation and quality - of - life are important end points for evaluating the clinical benefits of immunotherapy .    2.3163820378340114
experimental and clinical treatment models have proved that local il - 2 application is less toxic than systemic treatment and is therapeutically effective .    2.3353604489846194
here we report long - term experience with inhalation il - 2 therapy in 188 patients who had progressive pulmonary metastatic renal cell carcinoma .    2.582111336425649
high - dose inhalation of il - 2 was used with low - dose systemic il - 2 or ifn .    3.0348035575417676
maximal toxicity over the total treatment time was mild , and the low incidence of who grade 3 toxicity ( 24 % ) allowed social activities and UNK of social roles .    2.657702816132302
UNK for systemic side effects was required only in half of the patients .    2.6712615481798365
inhaled il - 2 prevented progress of pulmonary metastases in 68 % of patients for a median period of 9 . 8 months .    2.9778558562929884
median survival was 12 . 4 months compared with the expected 5 . 3 months and quality - of - life did not differ substantially from pretreatment status .    2.8882243602351414
local treatment can be applied alone or in combination with systemic therapy and can increase therapeutic efficacy .    2.8248335841312935
it is now well known that chronic alcohol abuse is an important factor for developing head and neck squamous cell carcinoma ( hnscc ) .    2.761638510471091
compared to common markers of alcohol abuse , UNK - deficient UNK ( cdt ) has been found to be more sensitive and specific .    2.808578396384356
it is therefore very useful for detecting alcoholism and controlling compliance of alcohol withdrawal .    2.2200473957960662
we analyzed the serum concentrations of cdt , liver enzymes and mean UNK volume in 49 male patients with hnscc .    2.230237882898173
elevated cdt levels were found in more than 25 % of patients who earlier denied a history of chronic alcohol abuse .    3.3617612239982537
over one - third of these patients developed an alcohol - withdrawal syndrome .    2.831098961245869
these findings demonstrated that analysis of elevated cdt serum levels was a valuable method for detecting chronic alcohol abuse and UNK patients at risk for developing an alcohol - withdrawal syndrome postoperatively .    2.146579372652408
apoptosis , or programmed cell death , plays an essential role in specific cell deletion during normal embryonal and adult development .    2.107176411229245
apoptotic cells are characterized by fragmentation of nuclear dna and formation of apoptotic bodies .    2.3361739177895804
molecular genetic analysis has revealed the involvement of several deaths and survival genes that are regulated by extracellular and intracellular factors .    2.101802090283854
there are multiple UNK and inhibitors which interact with target UNK receptors and transduce signals involved in cellular proliferation , cell cycle progression and programmed cell death .    1.8957572895505825
the elimination of tumor cell populations by applying lethal doses of chemotherapeutic agents or radiation is a well - established strategy in cancer therapy .    2.147884702872971
although improved cytotoxic chemo - and radiotherapy regimens are available , the efficacy of these strategies is still disappointing with regard to many solid tumors .    2.504519793530859
better understanding of the molecular mechanism of apoptosis , including death genes , death signals , receptors and signal transduction pathways , will provide new approaches in the development of strategies to regulate malignant cell survival and death .    2.293219455987562
recent discoveries in the field of apoptotic cell death promise to have a significant impact on antitumor therapies .    2.630074663537333
apoptosis is known to be an active process which can be artificially manipulated by several molecular pathways .    2.8056512084037597
this information concerning the regulation and induction of programmed cell death might lead among UNK , to the development of new powerful means to eliminate malignant cell populations of otherwise resistant genitourinary tumors such as prostate cancer .    2.307550565192668
we report on a 63 - year - old female patient with UNK - UNK syndrome ( mts ) .    2.903818878594883
in the course of this disease two carcinomas of the colon , a kerato - UNK and multiple sebaceous gland tumours , including four sebaceous gland tumours , including four sebaceous carcinomas , appeared .    2.4959187383566452
this case is thought to be a UNK form as one of daughters was also found to have a sebaceous UNK .    3.181693094264407
mts is a mostly autosomal - dominant disease with the association of sebaceous gland tumours and internal carcinomas .    2.484489134032857
as the malignant tumours only show slight aggressiveness the prognosis is quite favourable .    2.389078693242007
oral isotretinoin therapy was successfully used for the inhibition of sebaceous gland proliferation .    2.8051185994618395
a UNK definition is presented and an updated survey of the published cases is given .    2.4119570777115777
furthermore , the histopathologic peculiarities of sebaceous gland tumours , especially of sebaceous gland carcinomas , are discussed and compared to sebaceous gland tumours not connected with mts .    2.470069116731775
a total number of 100 of the 135 published cases of mts were included and analysed regarding sebaceous gland tumours and other skin tumours .    2.1530415610221403
the data on internal carcinomas were taken from the work of cohen et al .    2.445519103918751
( 1991 ) and 11 current cases were added .    2.5770662362262393
the rapid development of modern endovascular , microsurgical , and radiation therapies has considerably expanded the treatment options for UNK arteriovenous malformations ( avms ) .    2.007683751007478
surgery has the longest history .    2.7511867710976006
single or staged intravascular procedures ( UNK ) using fast - acting UNK , sclerotic agents , and UNK coils serve to reduce the size of avm to that suitable for extirpation and may reduce the risk of surgery .    2.7408807234266326
radiation ( " gamma - knife " ) therapy , most frequently used in small , non - operable avms , is also viewed by some authors as an alternative or even superior tool in small , operable malformations .    2.2613455024405846
partial embolization to reduce the mass - effect of space - occupying avms , to reverse UNK , and to treat avm - related seizure disorders is being discussed and practiced .    2.4810681160293298
given the in part competing or even controversial options , the selection of optimal treatment for avm patients is becoming increasingly difficult .    2.1155004940177164
current management is UNK by the paucity of information on the exact risks of invasive therapies and by insufficient criteria for identifying patients at risk of spontaneous bleeding during the natural course , including the seriousness of such hemorrhage .    2.3866672996558838
a new " all in one " sensing device was developed for continuous UNK intraoperative monitoring and in situ detection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve ( rln ) during thyroid surgery .    2.064864984046105
patients and methods : the new system is based on a double - balloon endotracheal tube with integrated atraumatic stimulating and UNK electrodes .    2.4913926013358556
the recurrent laryngeal nerve is stimulated UNK and compound action potentials are recorded from the laryngeal muscles .    2.1661444684652658
fifty - five patients were introduced into a phase - one clinical trial .    2.4995236020536034
thirty - five patients with primary thyroid operations , 20 patients with reoperations , 10 of whom had neck dissections .    2.5265773280538477
all patients were evaluated laryngoscopically and UNK by an ent specialist before and after surgery .    2.6621572257689357
results : compound muscle action potentials were recorded continuously during the whole operation and responded UNK to tension and pressure to the nerve .    1.9840490733102778
there were no accidental permanent rln palsies .    2.240565395326171
conclusion : the new system offers five advantages : ( 1 ) it is atraumatic ; ( 2 ) it is easy to use ; ( 3 ) it can monitor continuously with an audio feedback to the surgeon ; ( 4 ) it works outside the operation field ; and ( 5 ) it is highly sensitive , even indicating reversible irritation to the nerve .    2.3405999024242843
the diagnosis of primary malignant bone tumors , which only account for 1 % of malignancies in humans , represents quite a UNK for the pathologist .    2.781021258585627
apart from the often overlapping morphology between different entities , heterogeneity within one and the same tumor has to be kept in mind .    2.204704363728947
furthermore , in most cases the diagnosis must be established based on small biopsy specimens and occasionally even on frozen sections .    2.2295195768643636
in this context detailed clinical information including the patient ' s age and exact localization of the tumor , as depicted by x - ray or mri , are essential requirements for a correct diagnosis .    2.605796947124197
in addition , multiple biopsies from different tumor sites may be of help .    2.3668417668492503
for example , 25 % of osteogenic sarcomas ( osa ) are UNK .    2.631645384808279
others may contain areas similar to UNK ( fsa ) or malignant fibrous histiocytoma ( mfh ) .    2.118157601497389
since 90 % of osa occur in the second decade of life whereas chondrosarcomas , fsa and mfh usually manifest after the age of 40 years , a biopsy solely composed of malignant UNK tissue obtained from a tibial lesion of a 10 - year - old child should most likely be considered as part of an osa .    2.425925084171425
in the differential diagnosis of the so - called small , round cell tumors , which include ewing sarcoma , malignant lymphoma and small - cell osa , immunohistochemical staining of the paraffin - embedded material and a molecular biological / genetic work - up of frozen material are most helpful .    2.3542112874315526
in this paper the histomorphological characteristics and criteria for differential diagnosis of the most common primary malignant bone tumors are discussed .    2.992872987862086
the care of the patient after primary treatment is very important for both tumor control and UNK compliance .    2.849841710130407
the aim of this care concept should be the early detection of local recurrences so as to have better secondary treatment ( UNK cure ) options .    2.384882417295464
if expensive diagnostics are needed to get this information , it is reasonable to order them .    2.696446015423818
if there is no benefit for the patient , regarding survival or with respect to quality of life , clinical anamnesis and examination should be preferred .    3.0724623899925803
the effect on pain and heat sensation of UNK non - ionic contrast media with different osmolality was assessed in a randomized double - blind study .    2.2778521700287264
peripheral angiography was performed in 29 patients who suffered from chronic occlusive vessel disease .    2.8852979644189913
the two non - ionic contrast media iomeprol and iopentol were applied intraindividually .    2.0907271675972208
the contrast media with an iodine concentration of UNK mg / ml had an osmolality of 618 or UNK UNK / kg .    2.4232183179765205
the mean flow was 13 . 9 ml / s .    2.8652792575861348
no analgesic premedication was given .    2.6885512459424534
the pain and heat intensity was UNK measured using a visual analogue scale ranging from 0 ( no heat / pain ) to 100 ( intractable heat / pain ) .    2.0645042763167525
the median after the first injection was calculated as 40 for iomeprol and 70 for iopentol .    2.2962513358229155
the comparison of heat and pain sensations after the second injection showed a less distinct difference with a scale rating of 60 for iomeprol and of 65 for iopentol .    1.9328163000260261
the statistical variance was highly significant ( p < 0 . 01 ) in favor of iomeprol .    2.5148293643719715
shampooing is the most common form of hair treatment .    3.3100056373263698
shampoos have primarily been products aimed at UNK the hair and scalp .    2.2288421506148204
the UNK of qualities demanded from a good shampoo by today ' s consumer go far beyond this general function .    2.074689664390415
a cosmetic benefit is expected , and the shampoo formulation has to be tailored to all the possible variations associated with hair quality ( dry , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK ) , age ( baby shampoo ) , care UNK ( frequency of shampooing ) and specific problems relating to the superficial condition of the scalp ( UNK , seborrhea ) .    2.6070148603945156
selected UNK of shampoos that have been popular with the consumer are currently under attack because of potential risks associated with their use ( e . g . halogenated organic compounds , formaldehyde , UNK UNK , and crude UNK tar ) .    2.2946925053010707
our standard UNK training programs UNK limited attention to the subject of shampoos , and much of the readily available information concerning shampoos is supplied by the industry .    1.9651189243117682
we should be increasingly aware that our patients look to us to supply independent information on what can be expected from a shampoo to enable them to make more informed choices at the consumer level .    1.9094330607815957
in industrialized countries the rate of sudden cardiac death remains unchanged .    3.2373471900829935
the most frequently encountered structural heart disease in these patients is coronary artery disease .    2.996633088736074
despite the era of thrombolytic therapy of acute myocardial infarction patients carry an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrhythmogenic death within a time period of one to two years following the acute event .    2.5547099586213453
therefore , risk stratification post - mi before patient discharge is furthermore mandatory .    2.006696508649114
dysphagia is related to the impairment of food passage from the mouth to the stomach .    2.6316655330251875
globus UNK implies the frequent and often painful sensation of a lump in the throat that usually does not interfere with swallowing and may even be relieved by food intake .    1.8474142531369029
the diagnosis is based upon a careful history , clinical examination , endoscopy , dynamic imaging ( videofluoroscopy , UNK , videosonography ) and electrophysiologic procedures ( including pharyngoesophageal manometry , electromyography and ph determinations ) .    2.246980997193308
structural lesions of the cervical spine such as diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis are rare causes of dysphagia .    2.5438891084603705
dysphagia following anterior cervical fusion as well as globus and dysphonia due to dysfunction of the vertebral joints are more likely .    2.732204970130958
symptoms with swallowing fluids indicate a neurogenic origin .    2.38103934687582
UNK swallowing , nasal reflux , dysphonia or general weakness may also occur .    2.1752648056329047
chronic aspiration with respiratory UNK is the main consequence in a variety of neurological disorders as well as in cases of postsurgical dysphagia .    3.3063362534634533
relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter indicates coordinated muscle movement between the pharynx and esophagus .    2.382075466678692
dysfunction of the pharyngoesophageal segment may lead to cricopharyngeal achalasia .    2.873360485510875
a UNK sphincter commonly represents an UNK cause : i . e . , disease associated with gastroesophageal reflux .    2.291478826952147
disorders of the esophageal phase of deglutition can produce retrosternal pain , UNK , regurgitation and vomiting , as well as laryngeal and respiratory signs .    2.9393057377086618
esophageal motility disorders include lower achalasia , tumors , peptic strictures , inflammatory diseases , drug - induced ulcers , rings and UNK .    2.0998885858850747
motility disorders present with UNK , spontaneous contractions , diffuse UNK , or a UNK esophagus .    2.87177400170204
gastroesophageal reflux with esophagitis must always be excluded , especially in patients with a globus sensation .    2.974229696537146
the multiple features of the appearance of the symptoms of dysphagia and globus makes multidisciplinary approach necessary in order to establish a diagnosis and begin effective treatment .    2.674484607760361
different UNK arthropods and dermatophytes occurring primarily in farm animals may be transmissible to man and produce human dermatoses .    1.8751341922725306
the movement and cutaneous penetration habits of external parasites often cause UNK papules , severe itching and dermatitis or may damage their UNK by blood - UNK or by UNK them to their saliva .    2.0637007201970436
furthermore different dermatophytes should be considered a possible cause of human skin lesions .    2.814955680938127
farm animals ( UNK , pig , UNK , and rabbit ) can transmit external parasites ( ticks : UNK UNK , UNK UNK ; UNK : UNK gallinae , UNK UNK , and mites : sarcoptes scabiei var .    3.1530339723560767
UNK , sarcoptes scabiei var .    2.426238949348177
suis , UNK gallinae , UNK UNK ) , and dermatophytes ( trichophyton sp . , and UNK sp . ) .    3.0780350369494682
people who have close contact to UNK farm animals are more often exposed to UNK infections .    2.2529276830500913
certain professions , such as UNK , and UNK , are especially vulnerable .    4.071532716493347
between 1992 and 1994 two multicentre studies were performed in order to determine the frequency of sensitization to gold salts .    3.0936460071080565
in the first study ( 1992 - 1993 ) , UNK patients were tested with gold sodium UNK ( nts ) 0 . 25 % in UNK ( v ) , 0 . 5 % v . and with potassium UNK ( kdc ) 0 . 002 % aqueous solution .    2.5255760134759107
44 patients ( 5 . 1 % ) had a positive patch test reaction to gold salts : 40 ( 4 . 6 % ) to nts 0 . 5 % v . , 20 ( 2 . 3 % ) to nts 0 . 25 % v . and 5 ( 0 . 6 % ) to kdc .    3.297343593722141
a higher number of positive patch tests to gold salts was noted in patients also sensitized to another metal salt ( 8 . 5 % ) as compared to those who showed no other sensitivities ( 3 . 6 % ) .    2.6316246400948495
the development of multiple organ failure following major trauma is associated with remote organ failure , the dysfunction of organs which were not initially affected by the UNK .    2.4958560524446574
this UNK reviews recent data in experimental trauma research and offers a more detailed evaluation of the immunological findings in trauma patients .    2.398571604022083
in particular , the role of pro - and anti - inflammatory cytokines in the development or sirs , mof and UNK is discussed .    2.7645663431129712
despite the enormous progress in clinical immunology and the available data on trauma - induced immune dysfunction , a large number of questions still remain to be answered before the immunological alterations following severe trauma can be UNK influenced by immunomodulatory therapeutic efforts .    2.1382029753253966
a report on two cases with benign tumors of the atrioventricular node ( so - called mesothelioma of the av - node or UNK inclusions of the heart ) .    2.6872018170584115
in one of the cases the tumor could be the cause of the known electrophysiological disturbance of the conduction system ( av - block ) and of the sudden and unexpected death .    2.9849172198454177
a case of delayed death after a low - voltage accident is presented .    2.4255753480270874
at first , an obvious source of UNK was not found .    2.600875857143864
however , electric marks were found on the fingers .    2.346137399797124
in such rare cases death seems to be a result of cardiac arrhythmia resulting in ventricular fibrillation .    2.7874433138837773
a 53 - year - old man presented a melanotic lung tumor which was based in the bronchus of the left lower lobe and closed the left main bronchus .    2.361591324062951
after laser therapy , left lobectomy with UNK resection was carried out .    2.3448677566393825
complications after the surgery required resection of the rest of the left lung and thoracoplasty .    2.9647697983265022
based on the histological and immunohistochemical findings , the tumor was classified as a malignant melanoma .    2.660856619649311
there was no past history of an excision or a UNK of a cutaneous , mucous membrane , or ocular lesion .    2.5504273949182146
examination of the skin and the eyes did not yield any evidence of another primary tumor .    2.63757490818268
we conclude that the lesion represents a primary malignant melanoma of the respiratory tract , a rare neoplasm of which only 21 cases have been confirmed .    2.572519730774345
the patient does not have any evidence of tumor in the relatively short follow - up period of 10 months .    2.8271528227125575
background : to find out the incidence of spontaneous pubertal development in girls with turner syndrome we investigated patients with a bone age of at least eleven years .    2.6839296612800756
results : 6 out of 17 patients showed spontaneous puberty .    2.437503783547619
there exists no clear correlation between karyotype and phenotype on the one hand and incidence of spontaneous puberty on the other .    2.348829266073352
basal as well as stimulated UNK levels in the late childhood could better indicate spontaneous puberty in turner syndrome .    2.542181990154559
conclusion : in contrast to the generally held opinion spontaneous pubertal development is not rare in girls with turner syndrome .    2.1787571107243853
therefore estrogen replacement therapy should be started only after it became certain that there will be no spontaneous puberty .    2.16686212443735
from january 1992 until april 1995 , 31 patients with trans - and suprasphincteric anal fistulae ( transsphincteric n = 21 ; suprasphincteric n = 4 ; transsphincteric in crohn ' s disease n = 6 ) underwent a UNK followed by closure of the internal opening by suture and UNK flap .    2.1333641076054
all patients had undergone previous operations , some several times .    2.366486411719382
the recurrence rate of 13 % appeared to be low after a short follow - up .    2.647063920422426
continence was only UNK impaired , although the anal resting pressure and contraction pressure were significantly reduced .    2.2185510827704826
in five patients a shortened UNK period was noticed .    2.420838743271318
staging of malignant tumours of the oral cavity and the oropharynx not only requires far more than a basic knowledge of anatomy and the usual pathways of spread , but also a broad understanding of the diagnostic benefits of current imaging modalities .    2.407541603394707
as radiology should never try to replace histology , the main aim should be precise prediction of tumour margins and UNK of tumour from edema and UNK changes .    2.4197407982744346
only then will imaging studies have a significant clinical impact .    2.472612477205217
post - traumatic recurrent dislocation is a major problem in the operative treatment of shoulder dysfunction in young athletes .    2.80395526439141
this prospectively designed study evaluates the long - term results of a modified eden - UNK procedure in young male athletes .    2.4838009319323056
the criteria were : capacity in sports , functional limit , and persistent pain .    2.1780281792004157
genuine disorders of the glenoid or muscular imbalance of the shoulder joint were criteria for exclusion .    2.6214643229832557
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a disorder which primarily affected the myocardium .    2.4631504156732724
it is characterized by a hypertrophic left ventricle that shows normal systolic function but impaired diastolic relaxation .    2.052489426416453
the most important complication of hcm , sudden cardiac death , is mainly responsible for a mortality of approximately 3 . 5 % in childhood .    2.7277363514202144
while most patients remain asymptomatic for years , there are some reports about patients progressing from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to a dilative form within years .    2.2437697586867023
a prospective study was performed on 72 patients with osteochondritis dissecans ( od ) of the knee and ankle to compare plane radiography , mri and arthroscopy before therapeutic procedures .    2.5210612272511166
special interest was placed on the assessment of fragment stability with radiological methods for staging related therapy .    2.4149184128124346
od was localized in 46 cases on the femoral condyle and in 26 cases on the talus .    2.5014971312285414
radiological methods were performed simultaneously and shortly before definite arthroscopical therapy .    2.267263904007619
using conventional radiography , od of the condyles was staged according to the classification of UNK and UNK and od of the talus suggested by UNK and UNK .    3.143994435155774
mri staging was performed by morphology of the interface of the od .    2.7595580931166293
arthroscopical staging based on the classification of UNK .    3.6328693366397475
there was an excellent correlation between the stages in mri and arthroscopy , showing correct prediction of stable and unstable fragments in 92 % .    2.2292743907333383
in contrast , fragment stability could not be efficiently assessed by conventional radiology because fragments could be UNK fixed in cases of bony separation .    2.4087641022208004
mri is indicated before performance of staging - related therapy of od to select patients with stable fragments for conservative therapy and those with unstable od for surgical therapy .    2.0583936340740046
a case of rupture of the right UNK resulting from blunt trauma with complete intrathoracic dislocation of the right hepatic lobe in a multiple trauma patient is presented .    2.863791184451331
after a primary chest x - ray study had been interpreted as showing right - sided hemothorax , the thoracic drainage tube was UNK placed into the liver .    2.260288581456293
ct revealed a diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture with intrathoracic liver dislocation .    2.4515099995145575
the liver was replaced and the extended dorsal diaphragmatic rupture was closed primarily via an abdominal approach .    2.13400987999771
problems of diagnosis and operative procedure in rare cases of fresh right - sided blunt traumatic diaphragmatic ruptures are discussed .    2.518900139413316
