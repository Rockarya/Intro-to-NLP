133.19260256295794
that is precisely the time when you may , if you wish , raise this question , i . e . on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report .    72.62942840253017
the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part - session .    162.01069333083285
i would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally , on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups .    121.24041553128446
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind .    181.28523349152655
that did not happen .    87.60379776489665
i regret this , but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there .    165.14655930628754
even so , i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes .    147.37174146261873
safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods    20.581067688147996
madam president , we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads , but also on our railways and waterways , not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster .    213.7677287645911
all the same , we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety .    91.56503605893347
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards .    111.22181097538204
the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road , rail and inland waterway .    66.27727436704032
however , when it comes to safety , i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden , for example , is in principle no different from safety in germany , italy or austria .    95.8563632484746
as you know , like mr rack , i come from a transit country , where this issue plays a particularly important role .    189.86527397055696
therefore , we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved .    73.05599547924318
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job .    132.83813400347964
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure .    291.030942273685
a major part of wales , as you know , has been granted objective 1 status under the structural funds programme .    104.96043584557817
in her report , mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is UNK lacking , yet desperately needed .    122.9383731827625
the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund .    111.51024161816439
i think that this work has been carried out extremely well .    99.77775695201916
i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity - or that it was not given the opportunity , as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term - to discuss the directives .    122.24038443793962
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for UNK relations between towns and rural areas .    158.596116704213
key eu programmes between 1989 , 1993 , 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective 1 regions within europe .    137.09963948902308
personally , i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines .    159.81821535528277
these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us .    112.18981814602634
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being UNK to give a response , even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations .    85.47026523963812
i also think we should ensure , or ask member states to ensure , that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents .    147.98932739938405
mr president , i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work .    13.595360033072962
the european union ' s structural and cohesion policies are , without doubt , essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions .    181.22287116790974
however , i feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the community ' s regional policy .    87.28594686323837
they are growing , but only in terms of gdp .    95.60272612975079
i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made , ladies and gentlemen , and firstly on procedure .    131.57737029792239
and let me assure you , furthermore , that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid - term review in mind , in line with the regulations , then the point of view of this house , as expressed in this report , will also be taken into account .    59.48789795626111
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches , and shall attach , to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy .    129.8222069323652
at this stage , i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective 2 rural areas , in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective 1 regions .    50.1536546573952
in any event , i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter .    54.899472289464356
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know - how .    132.26102995759985
i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions .    104.13224403691206
genuine structural reforms and a competition - friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base .    165.986577923042
as regards taxation , state aid , the structural funds and defending our traditional products , practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency .    121.57691611149157
on this point which is of personal interest to me , let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context .    130.44130691046664
are there any comments ?    47.60276656762224
only , without transparency there will be no acceptance , indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency .    157.70637226205426
i also expect the commission to be pro - active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures .    160.4311111593332
this being the case , there are considerable disparities between states , which may be measured in various ways , such as , for example , as a percentage of added value and per wage UNK .    72.1443307668639
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the cohesion fund , among other things , which come at the top of the list .    63.31510950255493
the new model now being tested by the commission ought not to lead to a process of UNK pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy .    165.41638498013236
at the same time , this change of system will also lead to more UNK being placed on the individual in the business world , of course .    72.59250397583025
to conclude , i want to welcome the commission ' s UNK report on competition policy , on which , once again , a good deal of work has been done .    38.12829064643812
this is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the union , and i should like to thank mr jonckheer who , in his report , has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria , as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition .    99.70175438214753
there is state aid for businesses - we have already discussed this , there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the italian treasury controls 15 % of stock exchange UNK ; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions ; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about UNK ' s bid for UNK and the UNK of holzmann .    173.2184787187202
it is there to generate reactions and the white paper has certainly succeeded in doing that .    131.28192372108606
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern .    207.1798701373048
in the white paper , you state that the commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines , but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next ?    149.36447564230514
a system , such as the current one , which is capable of making so few decisions , be they approvals or UNK , is something less than a valid system .    215.66258676919472
amongst these , firstly , is the fact that , despite trying to modernise articles 81 and 82 , article 81 and not article 82 carries exclusive weight .    114.31597466957257
through his management , commissioner monti achieves good results , as did his predecessor and , clearly , he has established a guarantee which , in parallel with the creation and development of the european internal market , has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the union may work adequately , without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged , as has happened in the european union since 1993 .    230.74479492144033
mr president , for british conservatives the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the european union .    116.1083276878303
but all this , in effect , is so much rhetoric when we look at the national , regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true european single market .    222.31997764708206
in relation to legal certainty , i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen .    73.73165495777313
then it is possible to understand that , for example , lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to european competition policy , and brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are , of course , bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context .    224.94079419115988
we therefore await , and i await , the european commission ' s proposals on this matter .    66.82602991342621
i know this is difficult to achieve now , but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers , here and elsewhere , and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries , here and elsewhere , it will be difficult to preserve jobs in europe and outside it .    104.57346199002963
as far as we are concerned , we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes .    53.51525741107975
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies .    116.77880779482622
no , car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years .    193.18071773406052
in voting against the jonckheer report , i wish to assert the need for another policy , to wit , UNK all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff .    215.52654034904944
it is probably horrendous , especially in this particular raft of legislation , that there are confused rules , regulatory UNK and rules that only lay down UNK legal concepts .    250.25360361755205
we have seen this in the UNK seattle conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world .    189.66957257535577
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands , all of which must be protected .    93.13522022831282
mr president , competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force .    101.82935183701035
it is not enough to say that , in the member states , there is already 40 years ' worth of experience .    86.04152951983815
think of specialist , national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court .    182.57328147693107
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer .    103.35293303424471
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes .    72.04130495575299
so , mr president , i will walk away from this debate , for which i am very grateful to parliament , in the knowledge that we have the european parliament ' s intellectual and political support , which appears to come from all sides of the house , for competition policy , its basic appreciation for the work the commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future .    100.9028889033689
we would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency , transparency , and the protection of the rights of individuals .    139.36874275929114
the commission ought - and i have also amended this deadline to 31 may 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the commission , for coordinating and UNK the legal investigative body olaf .    146.14289389249925
in addition , we call upon the forthcoming intergovernmental conference to take up debate on the establishment of a european public prosecutor ' s office for the protection of the financial interests of the union , where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well - known experts , the so - called corpus juris , and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared .    64.52262927693738
it is now possible , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , that the commission will take new initiatives , and i would like to suggest to the commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity .    31.24920568085377
i believe that mrs theato ' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the european institutions take steps to ensure that european money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here .    104.44490922994977
unfortunately , however , people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity .    127.8381342053973
in the final analysis , we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a european public prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form , organised around a superstate .    92.68351583767793
when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda , it is the call for there to be clear UNK of competences that should take centre stage .    49.89395206083383
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about .    39.95191124612767
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date .    173.74860474366983
for this reason , it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests , and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual states .    65.44086047972436
i am referring to recommendations 1 and 2 .    84.9777048405321
vote    47.909083789412506
in this particular case , i can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on .    59.04812130530418
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure .    102.03049906161556
( parliament adopted the resolution )    12.835566226037889
since then , of course , this europe with UNK to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is , but which it refuses to see itself as .    149.97028583120013
- ( fr ) it is with great satisfaction that i welcome this report on improved harmonisation in the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods .    13.202222006943003
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals .    117.89697602177088
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation .    97.50528698306749
i therefore wonder whether the community should not have a more drastic change of tack and , based on very strict evaluations , change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively .    111.85711814191127
for example , we have seen the success of the leader i and leader ii schemes in ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of ireland and within europe .    161.77688550466888
in general , the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent .    104.38106717072561
we are convinced that the opposite is true , and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive .    78.62646556999798
i am happy with the rapporteur ' s treatment of state aid and i congratulate him on this .    78.15898800947123
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way , the commission has , on a number of occasions , authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code .    50.68746961412126
this is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed , particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners , in this case the oil tanker charterer , from any liability .    178.65654760741884
why not ?    111.51335270335012
this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area .    195.48527287697308
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as 400 , 000 birds , perhaps mainly UNK , may have died .    214.41490991699916
let me , in this connection , welcome the presence in the visitors ' gallery of mrs UNK - le UNK , spokesperson for the oil slick action group " UNK UNK " , made up of men and women from the french department of UNK .    299.359059588942
in this emergency , in this ordeal , we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity : local solidarity , national solidarity , and intergovernmental solidarity .    276.5889041903176
the date when the commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again . it is now scheduled for july .    178.66138420682333
twenty one years after amoco cadiz , this umpteenth oil slick , the seventh since 1967 , shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers .    169.83530609565162
many thanks for this .    167.762223365756
in my opinion , we should look further into this point , and i also think that the marpol treaty , which comes into effect in 2001 , should be looked at very closely .    136.84017047244848
just you go home and say : " we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date " .    149.17017101878076
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control .    163.4191678117375
then , sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 member states ; they should not be different , but the same throughout the union .    157.9165998512941
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika .    52.483704656595165
UNK the german UNK ship " UNK " - it is right outside my front door in cuxhaven - entailed the swift provision of european neighbourly help .    162.2514435936432
there are men and women who depend on fishing , gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas . they are environmentally sensitive areas , but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium .    227.98469271876758
in the days immediately following this terrible storm i wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the french authorities to UNK the boundaries of objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in france and elsewhere could benefit from objective 2 .    189.0279681980572
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forests in my region , lorraine , which have suffered enormous destruction .    322.68416170797195
hurricane " lothar " should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking UNK once the damage is done - something which is discussed at a very superficial level here - , but to switch to the precautionary principle , under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too .    356.1600837500504
current programmes must be accelerated .    91.46460784399349
i have listened to you very attentively commissioner , and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in france and in germany .    197.23938255029867
i say they have a right to solidarity .    104.81011408188355
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal UNK .    148.41270588452088
this is an irreparable loss .    124.12277814233536
when we had the earthquake in greece , which was a big disaster , the community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greeks .    127.45837289451461
i therefore believe that a european civil protection force , real civil relief blue UNK , who would go to areas in difficulty within the union , as we currently have no emergency procedure , but also outside the union if needs be , in UNK or anywhere else , is something that we should hope to see . i would like to tell commissioner barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly european in spirit .    210.10973902780196
between the UNK - food sector and the farming sector there are over 10 million employees .    233.02621108605416
as the white paper makes clear , the new authority must be a value - added structure .    79.05049341259252
i can assure you here today that the commission , in exercising its risk management functions , will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority .    140.65010854142093
it sets out over 80 separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation .    321.04674246311856
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem , those responsible are liable .    107.05437426463588
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs .    202.02610294276278
commissioner , the ignorance of certain member states has landed us in a major food crisis here in europe , and i am afraid that once more i have cause to be UNK at the fact that again no members of the council are in UNK , and that on the day that you present your interesting report .    127.62135646348425
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance , similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment ?    187.75534976045884
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september .    76.74661918957143
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not UNK .    107.89776235785362
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery .    60.79863119055969
scientists will be employed in - house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and , in those circumstances , as scientists will have to travel , it is probably better that they move to a central location , once again where the parliamentary structures and the commission and council are based .    213.01435459694278
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be UNK .    169.0155652582926
if the conclusion is that turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal european safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with lithuania , UNK and bulgaria .    227.36455828457758
a big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed with this report , so they have to take responsibility .    133.58989119160557
it is important to follow up and it gives the member states , as well as the united nations and the commission , something to think about when it is a matter concerning military UNK and their effects on the environment .    88.19754379467281
subject : appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in 1998 the tibetan government in exile received over UNK tibetans who escaped over the UNK mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb .    229.52620377381285
the european union did that at the european UNK summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on a number of human rights issues , including tibet .    90.05643146127389
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place , but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation , would be a step we should take in tandem with the european commission , rather than saying that it is a matter for the council .    131.4856077983635
it is an extremely moving account , not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well .    223.0036176233931
are these reports accurate ?    70.9422829226891
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself .    128.69063262863375
let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true ! " i would like to stress again that the commission has accepted all the ombudsman ' s recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 1999 " .    239.7886440522107
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis .    109.2522563750724
well i certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson .    139.5211468062981
secondly , in my view , while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory - after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the commission - it should be essential . and , since it should be essential , i would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training .    277.03380960957946
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process .    215.1998482550525
as far as mr papayannakis ' question is concerned , in the 1999 action plan for employment , the commission proposed certain recommendations for greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the action plan for employment .    79.31429502847836
the most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services , where problems exist , improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the action plan for employment .    231.36427456826172
we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved .    121.33056492578343
is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for UNK or trainees ?    75.60950605711878
there is , as yet , no european court case law on efterløn , but it could UNK be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality .    126.44302950272413
there will be no problem with danish nationals within denmark , that is not where the problem lies .    191.99901688013333
how many meetings of the group have been held to date ?    196.86288080762222
it refers to the special commission working group dealing with questions of equality .    106.1588143753876
three serious issues were discussed : the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women , of which i gave an initial evaluation , the second issue was the report by mr busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science , and the third involved mr kinnock , who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the community .    153.1944707160961
we trusted this commission , from the outset , to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women .    122.99554321520924
which community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly ?    205.56114185119742
the decision on this initiative was taken in berlin , where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action .    110.43297896851924
in a religious school , it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs .    218.82074676274902
it allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question .    244.18326829635112
subject : commission ' s plans for presentation of a new social action programme it is important that the commission present as soon as possible a new social action programme , setting out a specific plan with a timetable for implementation for both the legislative work in the area of social security and initiatives for framework agreements in the context of the ' social dialogue ' .    102.8449224443666
can the commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme ?    68.32164811839722
secondly , there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented .    215.45593265534353
it would be interesting to hear whether the commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have UNK , so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them .    194.47756961944881
the draft legislation before the folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements .    128.15572442464082
however , such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis .    133.5451082095123
because denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules , provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that , apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation , the hours in universally applicable collective agreements , concluded by the most representative organisations , also apply to posted workers .    258.9361488427765
the commission should now produce an ambitious and far - reaching reform programme .    180.8524921055725
this is not only necessary for proper public administration , it is a UNK sine qua non of regaining the trust of the european citizen .    99.29011541715408
this , however , presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents .    85.41100046655646
finally , this discharge report is naturally addressed to the commission . but this does not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order .    97.1323117974248
the second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the commission , in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts .    160.56209126787198
i have every confidence that if we and the politicians of europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need .    225.27802635264499
only in this way can we create a new culture in the commission and at the same time get public confidence restored .    142.2463886455764
i do not usually bother congratulating people but i think she has produced a very UNK report and deserves our thanks .    183.5677801009894
in our group , we find it hard to see how the financial administration for 1997 was in any crucial way better than that for 1996 .    64.9747517824007
we support these critical remarks , and i must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd , against this background , to vote in favour of approving the accounts .    79.31501950107281
a new independent audit system service must be set up .    88.08751876176744
a proposal can be made , a proposal should be made , on the basis of article 280 of the treaty , by the middle of this year .    55.19755595562709
we believe the vast number of recommendations of the wise men ' s report should be implemented .    51.578295050657545
mr president , i must start by UNK that i cannot be nearly as dramatic as mr elles in my presentation .    105.61554724568802
this is worth a compliment although i regret , of course , that he did not expound it in his own mother UNK .    196.21662257555911
the second report of the wise men arrived in september .    55.739674405145685
fraud , mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere .    70.70450768557768
this is probably the only way to achieve less fraud , less UNK , more transparency and more democracy .    92.06873218306282
reading now what happened then , not even a year ago , it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform , as is maintained today , so much so that this second report - which , on the other hand , could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases , since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report .    147.12681162291815
incomprehensibly , trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition , and i would not be surprised if union members were already members of olaf , thereby placing this institution which should , at least formally , guarantee its impartiality , at great risk .    183.46047250257774
i am sure that it will serve , amongst other things , to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups .    108.72948515089091
we therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and , if it is , i can assure him that he will have the support of this house in the reform process .    85.1263602544901
i do not know your exact view in this respect , mr kinnock , but it is clear that we want commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed .    95.12885836134095
parliament is a separate subject .    111.05501019492634
this commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the commission that went before it .    139.94598254375416
it should also be much easier to sack inefficient and UNK employees .    96.47977508161753
i am pleased that i can address him now in dutch , now that mr van UNK UNK has just done so . otherwise i probably would have felt slightly guilty about this .    204.55280927802087
mr president , mr van hulten , your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising , arduous and complex , and i believe this is important in a first report .    102.48605901332954
when one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though , it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them .    142.87062001360874
hence the transmission .    104.52501704645024
the need for transparency is rightly stressed , not least because greater transparency in the way in which the commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also UNK what the commission does .    111.39346896779674
that committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa .    73.10339560511558
naturally the court will be able to give its considered opinion on the proposed changes to the financial regulation but it is useful to recall mr UNK ' s comments to this house last month . " the commission ' s internal control " he said " is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation .    146.80775114674842
we propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong - doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line .    210.78926506092157
serious response to reports , confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong - doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure .    248.8557123305299
standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the house .    92.61235867187997
i was reassured that this was also the view of prime minister barak and president arafat , when they met on monday .    261.86205490764024
i wish UNK to remind the council and , should it be necessary , parliament , that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing .    126.2026780719052
mr president , i want to thank commissioner patten for his detailed account .    37.66319295557949
this may be proclaimed in the course of this year , with or without israel ' s support .    103.77904472397114
it is , therefore , regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being .    97.23187760984341
nevertheless , it is still regrettable that the european union , one of the most important financial donors , is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process .    117.05164587589654
peace in the middle east concerns us all , however .    131.14507470700488
the same goes for the other countries , especially for the palestinians , who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas b and c , despite the oslo agreement and subsequent agreements . between the period when the oslo agreement was signed and 17 october 1999 , UNK 000 UNK of land were confiscated , 8 UNK of which have been taken under mr barak ' s government .    142.81861148880876
in conclusion , while other countries in the middle east have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process , now that the syrian government has been brought into the peace process , egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward .    93.38316958473537
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , commissioner patten , i should like to thank you for your statements , especially commissioner patten , whose analysis i fully share and i shall not , therefore , repeat any of his ideas .    41.132769857338616
on the question of the referendum which various members have referred to : we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations .    222.75810931152827
at UNK , mr gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by europe to the region .    149.58066593148564
the council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the union .    94.98046653902635
the portuguese presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the eurojust network , since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of europol to be a matter for eurojust , this option cannot be ruled out at present .    190.2218060921667
it has already been mentioned that the treaty of amsterdam came into force in may and this parliament stated that the most far - reaching innovation in this treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom , security and justice .    33.23826588235147
in 1999 , europol took up its duties and we in the commission , UNK the portuguese presidency ' s statement today , sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to europol under the treaty of amsterdam , there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between europol and the relevant judicial institutions , and in particular eurojust .    102.18184547579138
and we hope , during the portuguese presidency , to present the final version to the justice and home affairs council , taking account of the UNK that i have just mentioned .    40.79551863704954
it looked , as mr schulz once aptly said in committee , as if the council understood the area of freedom , security and justice to mean an area in which the council has free UNK , security from parliament and the right to do and order as it will .    101.38660480097407
unfortunately , however , it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions .    129.22382582116748
similarly , it cannot be right for just a few member states willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent .    343.3258486248224
however , the council should also bear in mind that , if we are to improve the effectiveness of the fight against crime , we do not only need to widen europol ' s remit , as decided at tampere ; we also need to increase the number of officers and extend its remit to operational activities .    72.8660939634902
finally , as has already been said , it is essential , and i hope that the igc will cover this , to move to codecision with the european parliament in these areas , with democratic and judicial scrutiny .    61.39095190643766
i hope that it works out .    82.37761340225322
the level of racism in our society is terrifying .    94.001112522533
behind this lies another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house , namely to introduce such an area .    121.41975070313828
finally , in relation to the charter of fundamental rights , the citizens of europe need to have a vision of citizenship .    54.399369430150216
many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months .    152.83836594515327
there is so much legislation - and i very much welcome the portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised , that the people in this parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of europe are aware of everything involved in it .    114.1669975826996
it is barely six months since amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together ; we have been UNK each other up , we have had a few minor UNK , but we need to work effectively together .    159.4541788367151
mr president , i would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the council as well as the commissioner .    125.7819555788051
i should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment .    80.89087443809767
i refer to eurodac .    155.29874847904847
it further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks , so as to protect individuals , society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the UNK radiation that can be UNK by such installations .    199.93312576647475
with this in mind , it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes .    79.73900789120141
the report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the member states .    156.51992780794436
today , scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the bay of biscay is in danger of UNK , and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that bay .    242.86211008600105
this failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was UNK to put an end to ethnic cleansing , we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side .    133.86355331805893
mr president , mr president - in - office of the council , i heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures , in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities .    59.22366030425981
the question which i therefore ask myself is this : has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area , how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence ?    179.85779426717016
mr rübig , as i said , i understand your concerns very well .    70.71953995688223
i feel this is one area where europe can play a very active role , even if only in providing the UNK for exchange of experience and best practice among the member states .    208.91341515631987
since the council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset , it should , in my view , demonstrate this in practice .    104.27848909462838
i am delighted with the compromise motion for a resolution which we have reached with the gue / ngl , greens / efa , eldr and pse groups .    67.43124694272637
the european union must take the initiative and must also , as demanded in the motion , propose this initiative to the g7 because it is primarily a political question .    87.93899621741302
europe must play a role in this new international regulation and i am extremely happy that today , with this debate and this motion , this question is now on the agenda of european construction .    121.29161312505776
at any rate , the commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the european union .    75.33650513430774
even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets , because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably .    176.57821247624474
the measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today .    94.52394952863236
i have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands .    100.2828809283062
we have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions , but so far we have had no working set of rules , as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the asian and latin american crises .    193.93594756716294
usd 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world ' s currency markets . this represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services .    110.29579939344562
when the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global , the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators .    183.22116213914754
i would point out that the european union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and , like mr désir and several other speakers , i feel that the european union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect .    87.22901600354218
mr UNK has described those who engage in this as the aids virus of the world economy .    182.88348865329505
of course , this cannot be done in one country ; it cannot be done within the single currency area , but it could be done at international level with global cooperation .    103.65703664235083
i am disappointed in the epp .    96.68282549060095
the danger is too great for us to ignore .    130.4799525054242
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem .    94.88442536582978
we can take action against this ; it is possible .    87.8423116082423
in short , we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other , because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results .    142.37766673870735
in order to remove these causes , one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question .    46.57934068905206
i have received four motions for a resolution , tabled pursuant to rule 40 ( 5 ) of the rules of procedure .    113.16442397036745
do forgive me .    47.65731162248345
madame president , the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament .    152.9098245836441
shame on you mr bertinotti !    95.89298884828996
you might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda .    226.82878472816182
however , my criticism - and i freely admit this - my UNK , is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so , messrs schüssel and haider and their parties , .    402.5667452792221
please support the austrian people against this government !    228.5582887542025
we know that most austrians respect these values .    176.11123786673403
however , that is not the problem .    80.11400578498169
the question is whether the union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a member state which includes such a party .    60.46911317781102
it is the meeting of europe with itself , with its raison d ' être , with the reasons why we are here in this chamber .    110.8713359859552
if europe has any meaning , and - my friends will pardon me telling them - if christian democracy has any meaning , if the history of christian democracy has any meaning , then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and , whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same UNK up again , must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation .    226.16235602104675
this is the reason why i feel that the european parliament , which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the council or the commission , must pay tribute to those people in the various states and european institutions who had the courage to say no , and it must say , madam president , that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit , and in clear terms declare , without UNK , its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in austria , UNK the statement made on the day of the munich agreement by a great french christian democrat who said that , if you are going to have to say no , then the best time to do so is right at the beginning .    113.89481458856301
it is for reasons of UNK that the president - in - office of the council ought not to have made the statement he did , and in a manner that goes against the treaty .    81.69289245819152
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this ?    48.557879733115534
they have to look at , for example , the concerns of people in relation to a special issue , and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case .    146.04089460396378
we are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted .    36.29901501413107
at a UNK for aids patients , i met two irish catholic UNK who were UNK for dying aids patients .    151.42760655273165
mr president , the group of the european people ' s party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the european council in helsinki .    19.792131536536072
it seemed to us that the agenda lacked content , because our group was thinking in terms of the treaty and , specifically , the protocol on the union ' s institutions .    79.19313076733282
it is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform .    156.27782043852667
moreover , given that this opinion is quite important , we can still vote for it , and indeed , the majority of our group will be voting for it .    111.62265189343482
what we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of europe , and , in particular , a europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs , because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the UNK and concerns , the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians .    143.2215176371654
we are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles , one which are still , unfortunately , outside the european parliament and the commission .    145.94297832883538
i would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps UNK up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights .    197.84859424639805
this effort was appreciated , even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals , and moreover , mr president - in - office , you also expressed different views .    134.76656635729253
of all priorities , this one is the most pressing .    108.43249162410224
i am thinking of the contributions from mr bonde and mr sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively UNK but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist eu .    158.03635778703722
it may be easy to come up with solutions , but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term .    159.82319891004326
a ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that parliament can safely become and remain a UNK assembly .    138.41353660089294
if you apply the existing principle of UNK proportionality , six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants , you already have the situation where luxembourg with UNK , 000 people has more members in this chamber than wales , which is a partly self - governing region of the united kingdom .    259.7270583647422
the council is consulting us and parliament is giving its opinion .    120.12088643332451
i understand this anxiety , this fear that the agenda may be too limited , and yet i feel , as i said to the committee on constitutional affairs on returning from helsinki , that we can work on the basis of this helsinki mandate .    160.4207230870512
i also believe that parliament ' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the council to adopt the directives as opposed to the commission ' s proposal .    45.63088091782976
i propose to confine my comments to two areas .    122.5494760004798
we have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other , that of finding the easiest possible solution .    208.48288274482508
there are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive .    113.57246500130486
partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the united kingdom .    80.06280212082001
mr president , commissioner , first and foremost i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to mr wieland for the efforts they have UNK in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner .    97.53396402016884
how is article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view , as this will have important implications , notably for the accession negotiations and for our country , which shares common borders with so many applicant countries ?    177.2593544200303
i think that , with this report , we are , once again , one step closer to the realisation of the internal market .    65.33279557416601
the proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim UNK , but europe is a legal construction , its courts are central to its proper functioning .    175.1387846412978
however i also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here .    89.06194126619866
exceptional financial aid to kosovo    161.08928380353112
the next item is the report ( a5 - 0022 / 2000 ) by mr brok , on behalf of the committee on foreign affairs , human rights , common security and defence policy , on the proposal for a council decision providing exceptional community financial assistance to kosovo ( com ( 99 ) 0598 - c5 - 0045 / 00 - 1999 / 0240 ( cns ) .    4.752852785113644
mr president , this is an important and urgent matter , and parliament is complying with a request from the commission to come to a decision quickly , because today , you must realise , men and women are dying in kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero , these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid .    100.41921844879955
mr president , if we are going to discuss kosovo today , as we have done many times before , then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in kosovo , or of whether in fact anything has been done at all .    156.4996492872762
it is responsible for reconstruction down there and for the fourth pillar , but it cannot constantly be called upon to pay mr kouchner ' s outstanding bills .    169.77121542254793
the rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should , and must , provide help swiftly , however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random .    58.736045505785874
it is also irrelevant , in my view , as to who is working towards separation and division in kosovo .    162.0127906335635
this will no doubt allow us to release the funds for kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both mr swoboda and mrs pack have mentioned .    289.842243950388
the union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy .    87.33069266548128
i can UNK that i have already received significant interest in the altener programme from my own constituency of leinster , a significant portion of which falls within ireland ' s only objective i region .    147.80765058612843
all of this will provide greater coordination , transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes , into which we will also have to incorporate the save programme , which we will be discussing soon .    141.86791214939612
if we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do .    228.60555629177713
from the point of view of the commission , in this interinstitutional game , i believe that this is important and i am very happy to highlight it .    33.82230729559028
madam president , i agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and i must add that , during the conciliation procedure , i was personally a little disappointed with the council .    91.21170703954704
lastly , i would like to mention the profoundly human impression i have formed of the rapporteur , mr graça moura : his knowledge , his sense of balance , his intellectual qualities , make him , in my opinion , the best possible rapporteur this report could have had .    107.45095223978579
we should , above all , not lose sight of this . the impetus given to the european idea by this programme is having an enormous impact , especially on small linguistic areas such as the netherlands which not only has national potential , but is also relying on support from the programme , mainly from a language point of view .    262.01337932773635
of course , it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and i for one will always advocate this - but i do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes .    183.61584363951897
i have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect .    157.20912095076548
all that remains for me to say is : time to get down to business .    54.32391693226277
i too must say that i will be voting for this joint text for a council and european parliament decision with a very heavy heart .    129.60621722512732
madam president , i absolutely agree with the rapporteur ' s analysis and i would also like to thank the chairman of the committee on culture , mr gargani , for his praiseworthy work in a mediation process that was also , considerably difficult .    104.33250095087928
as for the important educational task which the european union must carry out as regards culture , one of the programme ' s most obvious limitations is the level of funding - we have heard this several times - which censures the fact that the council at least - certainly not the commissioner - is not completely aware of the importance of cultural action : the document which UNK the economic factor over social integration also bears witness to this .    160.15135185404077
madam president , i will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that i support the adoption of culture 2000 and add my thanks to the rapporteur , mr graça moura , who took over from our former colleague UNK UNK .    138.5859751352136
but , more importantly than that , cultural activities are what make mankind civilised .    172.59472112438274
cultural cooperation - and this was also mentioned earlier - truly creates identity , far more so than any transport directive , however important it might be .    141.2042264781971
what , may i ask , is the council afraid of ?    150.86238632865738
man and culture are priorities , and culture can result in economic growth .    213.12805275339625
madam president , may i first thank mr graça moura for UNK his way through the rather tough UNK and UNK that have made up this conciliation UNK .    155.98006566572423
my only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver .    150.48055252396526
i should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens , both in personal as well as in social and economic terms , but a right which it is our job to assert , and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the union .    311.2061577263986
a number of members of parliament have quite rightly raised this point . if the union is purely an economic union , then it is a UNK project .    129.86328848774193
even though they can no longer be driven , these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders ; and not just intra - community borders , but also those outside the union .    241.15570449523346
the principle of ' polluter pays ' is not being applied .    12.11931142937592
and what about vehicles which are already on the road ?    65.30047662196822
that is a basic principle which we must uphold .    44.29895463316654
this means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility , financial as well as otherwise , for recycling vehicles .    122.8707221323749
that would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the european union .    68.65034320499065
retrospective law is bad law , it is unfair law and often it is UNK law .    298.52024679299706
that is why i have called for a roll - call vote on this .    155.28646350059736
cars are also part of our cultural heritage . i think we would all agree on that .    196.46148545131118
vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry !    106.11223921586921
let us beware , too , of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application .    275.53168823102965
in addition , car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re - use .    97.0860717359729
there are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case .    106.1057369160915
the principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy .    112.85923134180331
first of all , as my colleague mr bowis has pointed out , it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle .    152.83828674424618
the common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost , they should also take back end - of - life vehicles .    53.948922509392844
if car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies , this will UNK transporting end - of - life vehicles over long distances .    115.12947554816986
it worked for us .    92.46522569561293
we know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it , and there is no excuse for not taking action .    200.2249315158726
do we imagine , then , that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive ?    240.6532069840498
after the first reading in the european parliament in 1999 , the commission ' s proposal ended up in an awkward political situation in the council .    92.15812045910155
parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in europe .    189.88499716416848
amendments nos 4 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 28 , 30 , 32 , 37 , 42 and 48 concern the phasing - out of heavy metals .    31.39499566474457
i want to emphasise that , as early as 1997 , the commission proposed a special clause concerning manufacturer ' s liability and that the commission entirely supports the common position .    131.6402908582719
the high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year 2006 were removed .    114.04831528523412
allow me also - listen carefully to what i am saying now , because i have heard this reiterated in the debate - allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and " UNK " cars as mentioned in amendments nos 3 , 7 , and 9 , section 2 , and 35 .    149.0547423270624
furthermore , amendment no 43 does not fall within the directive ' s area of applicability .    67.8410815233469
- ( fr ) i am pleased to see the excellent report on the communication from the commission entitled ' women and science ' .    40.695401826409544
the goal for the years to come is to increase women ' s participation to achieve a rate of 40 % female participation in the marie UNK grants , in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development .    131.48948801355414
in order to do so , it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various member states , to set up a coordinating body to implement a ' women and science ' monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development , specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women ' s participation in research activities .    64.84970585292822
people must realise this !    132.48417334665052
first of all , who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction ?    56.05899394957283
i regret that the manufacturers have UNK the european parliament and the council with a whole UNK of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false .    52.6348797320698
how can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the court of first instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that court because it is UNK ?    61.16323300668786
nevertheless , the legal mechanisms that exist in the treaty are weak , difficult to apply politically and legally , do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance . suspending a state is just such a process , and is to be condemned .    314.295575130505
- the european parliamentary labour party has abstained on the final vote on the leinen dimitrakopoulos report .    217.11778971592048
the most important task of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states .    13.210640864582047
is it the product of mere foolishness or , more probably , of a deliberate strategy , which is the same throughout the world ?    338.22294225114007
i passionately defend europe ' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law .    46.27535249960722
this is not the way to fight extremism .    65.24243048309779
some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections .    143.81065012588158
UNK do not change their spots .    80.59978027230021
. ( da ) the left ' s members of the european parliament attach importance to the fact that , with today ' s decision , parliament has not supported the fourteen prime ministers ' diplomatic sanctions against austria .    56.7958150890956
at this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo - nazis in the government of a european union member state , i must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone .    93.19379989781646
we are nonetheless , as is our right as well as our responsibility , telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand .    217.7175982839024
we have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the UNK politics that jörg haider stands for .    125.47589862381645
we are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the 14 member states have employed on this issue .    141.0451132492196
the austrian elections were held in a free , proper and democratic manner .    104.02483653198134
i condemn jörg haider ' s racist and xenophobic policy .    123.34542214179179
thank you , mrs banotti , and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this .    89.38022932416763
mr wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party , the french communist mayors , were sending UNK against immigrant UNK in france .    223.25104834359786
as you know , we can only include five items in the ' human rights ' section .    88.71041505463687
is there a member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal ?    12.837583793151017
quite , we agree absolutely .    76.2528002285093
. ( fr ) madam president , ladies and gentlemen , commissioners and members of the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , i was given the task of drawing up the european parliament ' s report on the community initiative programme interreg iii .    15.935329746513
the main changes are as follows : all rural areas will be eligible to benefit from leader + ; the selection criteria for local measures will be more rigorous ; integrated local development plans will be introduced as priority themes , such as the use of information technology , improving the quality of life , and adding value to local products .    126.90417135539202
everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age , gender or origin .    108.93614452559358
the member states should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations .    67.3025068858427
some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents .    146.97398772290484
we need to deploy the energies of the unemployed , the UNK skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems .    299.90310449099104
particular emphasis is given to the point that women ' s opportunities on the labour market ought to be improved and that to achieve this more UNK should be built .    198.55351653786488
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism adopted this opinion on the equal report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one UNK .    38.138198442436725
our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the interreg , tacis , ispa and phare programmes .    99.64736527158932
anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly , but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval .    193.56466423194732
in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism , the confederal group of the european united left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion , mr nogueira román , on leader .    21.212628893036012
let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population .    186.39815424571952
there are twin problems that still remain for many regions in europe : firstly , the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road , water treatment facilities and related transport networks ; secondly , the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long - term unemployment , which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of europe .    123.35458844544534
overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any UNK effects .    103.51888930495551
how will these people be selected ?    94.52060198988352
we must create joint , interregional and transnational management bodies , in which all local and regional authorities , as well as economic and social operators , play an active role .    84.77238557047126
there must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border .    165.03748883195885
i have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon , so that it becomes accessible to everyone .    165.5432699657287
i am glad to see that this was accepted into the report , but i cannot agree with amendment no 9 because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all .    120.12619684823417
so , the concept for leader + should retain all the positive aspects of previous programmes .    163.702066788811
mr president , rural development has been identified by this parliament and the commission as a priority policy area , and i would like to welcome here today the commissioner responsible , commissioner fischler .    95.34598364398587
for this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development .    143.4710718189255
i , for my part , have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme , and i have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the european parliament devoting special attention to them .    109.50781597887452
i hope that the chamber will be just as committed this time .    213.14807146164807
we have all spoken favourably of this programme ' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation , in addition to cross - border cooperation .    212.68411367934883
this increased awareness does not , however , affect identity alone .    93.4864842966164
interreg could well allow UNK of such cooperation .    134.35216147811911
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , i shall confine my observations to mr decourrière ' s report .    35.92001775077226
interreg must , therefore , be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the union if we do not wish to see a two - or even three - speed european territory .    80.64377014150824
it is to take new ideas and try them out in leader , with the participants on the ground , with the local organisations on the ground , with many non - governmental organisations , with the churches , with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities .    184.15050468478583
this across - the - board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way .    151.68986192723534
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i am not always proud of the UNK that goes on here in parliament , but the urban programme is one of the best examples of our work : it was created following an initiative in parliament .    106.48768090392167
now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle - size towns and cities , as they do not have enough resources .    206.9407467652982
in its draft guidelines , the commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past .    161.4882044657782
transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs .    99.03987690192494
i have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the taos . criticism of the previous commission ' s work was particularly severe , legitimately so , with regard to these technical assistance offices .    124.04349048968227
on 26 october 1999 the european commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the cap .    135.28590691251608
i agree completely .    64.45670319564134
but , as for the future , since we must look ahead , i am extremely concerned to see how urban is going to be implemented in practical terms , and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn , because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be , for future financial perspectives , a new european regional planning policy .    118.48361241540887
so we are working within this framework and not outside it .    101.9822153077365
it has already been compiled by the commission and i can make a copy available to any member of this house who is interested .    74.18163471917087
having given them thorough consideration , i can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs 2 , 4 , 5 and 7 are acceptable to the commission and are adopted .    92.29171321161262
the proposal in paragraph 6 will also be partly accepted because it reaffirms that the time allowed for approving programmes under leader + is a maximum of 5 months .    168.761496144809
i agree with mr leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand .    132.12986097759068
thank you , commissioner .    93.77774851682571
( the sitting was closed at 8 . 40 p . m . )    9.260415641458776
we just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and i would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning .    112.45404468949938
madam president , i would like to comment on the request mrs stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the community initiative equal until tomorrow .    54.813775384544506
mr corbett , i have not received any notification .    76.5722827883235
when i speak about external aid , my thoughts immediately turn to the balkans . there is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground , an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems .    158.48915953166068
we have done a lot in the balkans : the new european reconstruction agency for kosovo , the balkans task force and new regulations to speed up procedures .    167.1426102088156
there are concerns even within the fifteen , concerns which may even surface again in the next decade .    224.2789620805113
the erika oil slick and the contamination of the danube demonstrates the pressing need for european scale intervention to safeguard the environment .    171.48739007738897
we also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document .    79.5400351975805
all the countries in the mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity , democracy and the rule of law .    34.265822903791644
it would be europe ' s UNK if we were to end up with just a few multinationals and no future for small and medium - sized businesses in europe .    105.28084371129414
we too want to help put europe on its feet .    83.43286104844735
however , there is a current trend - the " fauna , flora , habitat " directive was quoted as an example - which , in my country at least , creates the impression that associations are UNK national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to brussels and that brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural UNK in the countries of the european union .    245.42182132899356
i believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and i would like to condemn it here and now .    88.17203068099538
with regard to the four great priorities which president prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us , i would say that we are very much in agreement .    79.66830279302931
it means the reform of the united nations and the international financial institutions , for which europe has an enormous responsibility .    52.55706803019167
they are political because we are moving on .    99.39412316372189
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political .    92.05347937114352
first let me speak about the economy and social development .    151.69849846246328
should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria , in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no member state should be higher than , say , the three most successful countries in this matter ?    214.9251942996286
do please try to make the international organisations democratic .    151.5332929743587
what you just said is absolutely true : people want more engaged democracy .    108.38610738970638
mr bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations , which seems to go in a different direction .    138.10078451320453
you yourself , mr president , spoke of a model of which , unfortunately , there is little mention in the document . you said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic , social , cultural and ecological development , both internally and towards the outside world , which differs from other models , including the us model .    163.4024462649165
if you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead , you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the european union as a whole and , as we have heard today , you will enjoy widespread support in this european parliament .    81.50110399995442
even today , we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power UNK in the eastern republics .    217.7334184347308
we could not agree more with the latter .    48.0954095484616
it is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross - border issues and stopped UNK out the european cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities .    171.7986286974865
the activities of the entire union must be reduced to core areas of policy .    74.91332950649416
our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart .    150.0143949030679
we hope that the white paper and the actions of you and your commission will put this into practice .    81.38474439867149
our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries , but also by many people outside europe and the european union .    97.75190114197561
madam president , president of the commission , this is a vital document for the future and fate of europe .    125.5181565668591
these goals will be more easily UNK only if the intergovernmental conference , which will draw to a close within the year , results in constitutional reform , providing the commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement council decisions or parliament ' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real european government .    280.3623145965471
in essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity .    68.0019568828049
firstly , the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors , with the backing of the european investment bank .    212.24359031574622
i would remind you that this group , the ppe - de , does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones .    94.91314159822007
it is all very well for us , by mutual consensus , to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation , but you must be very aware that the lack of resources , the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget , continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved .    179.00815114848993
we therefore wonder whether the commission has the political will to resolve them .    44.445879627155186
all these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of 15 % , 20 % or 25 % which are unrealistic in the long term .    165.48088623592201
i do not necessarily mean financial resources .    238.14935745284308
as regards the other aspect of agenda , the aspect of cohesion and regional development , there we do indeed have great achievements to point to , but there are still less developed regions , particularly island regions , to which more attention should be paid .    170.42256682607155
we have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers , intensifying pressure on member states who fail to implement single market measures and , of course , extending into crucial new areas like financial services .    199.94568724637088
after all , what is social justice if it is without full employment ?    214.70534446140488
i also welcome commissioner busquin ' s idea to have a common research area for the whole of the european union .    102.08064843146876
the next five years of the prodi commission - as you UNK announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change .    100.12806945114404
we wholeheartedly support the programme as it is now laid down in a consultative document and which is also included in the programme of vice - president , mr kinnock , on behalf of the commission .    105.96878520215868
the commission makes only a passing reference to economic and social cohesion , to solidarity between member states and to the european union ' s regional policy .    46.36573352786138
are reducing the disparities between levels of development and the consequent promotion of real convergence objectives that we have already achieved ?    201.29453931757695
it also UNK that enlargement means that we must get regional policy right . unless we achieve real convergence , the cohesion of the european union itself will be at risk .    95.58300089017534
within the employment strategy we will look for a deepening and broadening of the strategy following the review under the portuguese presidency and within the framework being proposed by the portuguese presidency .    262.008458768454
we must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry .    188.69780033394434
i am seriously concerned that unless the commission recognises that this is an important aspect of how we will create a UNK europe , we will make progress on the economic front , on the employment front and even on the issue of foreign and security policy , but our citizens will still remain UNK because they will fear the unknown and they will fear those they do not understand .    179.7630479636011
can you explain why the approval given to the assistants was withdrawn at the last minute ?    125.22384067995482
will you do everything in your power to ensure that such last - minute UNK do not happen again ?    164.98691197404526
will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible ?    82.49293656784421
if there are such rules , who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility ?    188.14925582456783
but all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of parliament .    218.59045826224826
i personally believe that it is nothing short of scandalous that we hear members of this parliament attacking the demonstration rather than looking at the solution to the problem , which is fair conditions , fair pay and fair hours .    168.42303540898118
the supposed progress achieved in 1999 and mentioned by the report only occurred in the dublin conventions and schengen agreements and a further action plan from tampere which all restrict the rights of immigrants .    200.54538640164105
as the smallest community initiative in existence , we therefore proposed an increase in its funding through an amendment which was rejected .    141.38165373955434
subsidiarity should make us realise that the state , exercising its governing functions , and local authorities are the bodies most able to intervene appropriately . the state can ensure public safety and the local authorities can help disadvantaged people .    189.0248609164745
clearly some people are profiting from the opportunity to indulge in another budget UNK race which is particularly UNK when the convergence criteria for emu are imposing a very strict UNK regime on the national budgets .    224.0386583499096
why am i stressing this point ?    124.7834531111396
i must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of european integration .    67.81280176053258
procacci report ( a5 - 0025 / 2000 )    46.18863514059448
one of these of course is the reduction by around one half in appropriations made available even though they will cover a longer period .    137.13800116603096
amendment no 10 which i tabled on behalf of my group refers to the concept of ' economic and social cohesion ' rather than ' regional development ' as the european union does not have any recognised competence in this area .    169.3326444263176
and thirdly , if we are to have a transparent consumer policy , we need to label genetically - modified feedingstuffs .    101.0304481175314
by regulating additives in feedingstuffs consistently , we can help significantly to restore confidence .    211.23960837602053
consequently , we too shall also vote to reserve our right to refer the proposal back to committee if need be .    251.34871116107269
mr president , commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives .    76.28604726009833
but even in this crucial area of administration , parliament reflects its commitment to subsidiarity by encouraging member states to take on and to face up to their responsibility .    181.92967977603058
the committee on behalf of which i am speaking , namely the committee on the environment , public health and consumer protection , decided in december , on the assumption that the chairman of the committee on agriculture would draft such a good report , that we could waive our opinion .    76.48546986769435
if it is merely a hand - me - down legal basis taken over from previous directives , then it is a mistake to keep it .    145.69833527170118
mr byrne , i ask you to accept and agree to the change of legal basis for the sake of transparency and good cooperation .    96.53649626553617
we do not have another law at the moment , and until we do , we must deal with genetically - modified micro - organisms as and when we pass legislation ; we must include them as an add - on and insist that they be labelled .    245.64447888972617
this is an issue that we will no doubt be UNK on a number of occasions in the future .    33.60072518968401
this is something that people are very worried about and quite rightly so : i myself share these concerns .    123.75461714109763
at present there is a difference in treatment between authorisations , depending on whether applications were submitted before or after 1 january 1988 .    250.6535200369225
i remind parliament that in article 152 the primary objective is the protection of health .    188.75861713675056
it is being addressed and will be addressed in a comprehensive way , particularly in directive 90 / 220 .    75.53863385703666
i should , however , like to add that it only makes sense if we ensure that the new tse regulation allows a reasonable UNK between consumer protection and practicable suggestions .    70.07308256632304
mr president , over the years , the following situation has arisen : one subject has developed into a subject of many facets .    106.85377274104795
when we have the chance to ask direct questions , the questions which mr böge referred to will be asked .    135.12369277682834
questions will be asked - questions which i shall have to put to you and the commission representatives in committee - on how things stand with the bse status of the member states and other third countries .    145.8133233875599
UNK , medical and other products cannot be excluded on the grounds that they cause no harm or are not dangerous .    131.16688926967828
we have a new commission .    60.55044387267004
it is very good that they are continuing to monitor this issue on behalf of parliament because it is extremely important .    148.2574125293069
i look forward to receipt of that document , which will be taken into account in all further considerations in relation to this issue .    76.82198393805918
we need to get into that conciliation position .    82.76328545367187
the chemical industry and , unfortunately , the european commission and the council of ministers too want to draft a separate risk analysis for each dangerous substance .    61.835202205484144
there should be no initial delay to allow new evaluation criteria to be developed before the measures are implemented .    170.79998293016178
the increase in vulnerable areas , both wet and dry , inequalities between countries , inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic , economic , geographical and UNK events are all the evidence we need . however , these must not lead to competition distortions within the community .    409.2220758256402
the committee on the environment ' s present proposal to reduce discharges to close - to - zero is , in my view , to be welcomed and worthy of UNK .    94.24339461896913
needless to say , the directive also needs to be binding .    88.0188950171199
we should also recognise that , in europe , our fresh water sources may be said to be on the UNK between being owned by everyone and by no - one .    136.42416791595338
i also hope that the vote will not be a UNK and that will depend on what i see as two quite fundamental points .    107.24274384638451
it is also important to reinforce the polluter pays principle because prices must speak the ecological truth .    100.83575865136334
we can do this by , as a parliament , amending the council ' s common position and showing the way forward in working for a cleaner environment .    125.457144687466
we all know in december that christmas eve falls on UNK december and we start buying presents .    152.5245382921115
the present proposal UNK up the protection of the aquatic environment in a number of ways which exceed our current environmental objectives .    62.491220560561466
anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way .    266.7979564548675
it would be helpful to stress this convergence of intentions and efforts because i can see a particular problem with coordination , specifically between the commission initiative - which certainly does not only address members of national parliaments , but also members of national parliaments - and our committee ' s programme . following the working meeting of 1 february , which commissioner barnier referred to and which benefited from the UNK contribution of the commission , the committee intends to take stock of developments at the intergovernmental conference at all of its meetings .    196.7982242276127
my personal opinion is that it would be wrong and unfair to penalise the austrian people , businesses and employees because of concerns prompted by the establishment in austria of a new government coalition .    187.71299588498277
i will perhaps say this differently from mr tsatsos and mr brok who are your direct representatives but it is also probable that , in many cases , we will say this together .    169.64407481357463
mrs maij - weggen , given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the igc , it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now .    132.0764725665445
that is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti - european movement and anti - european organisations that exist .    258.89934915031074
if i said anything different i would be UNK myself as commissioner for regional policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions . you will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people , where they live , to preserve their roots , traditions , soul and identity .    162.5563471337074
it also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the portuguese and french presidencies .    217.4899482622619
under the european community ' s damage assessment , estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to UNK and health houses amount to eur 4 million .    195.00077889109423
the commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds .    135.74541774874527
i do not think that our reconstruction agency or the task force before it , which have been working incredibly hard in kosovo , would regard it as an adequate description of their UNK to suggest that they had been standing UNK by .    154.03993054185847
are you aware of this ?    116.79510988720598
we have also been substantial contributors of development assistance under the tacis programme to armenia .    80.41214507516298
the difficult part , which will fall to the convention , is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the treaties .    151.4540347166011
we can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text , a text that can be easily read by the citizens , and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument .    104.1172288881399
secondly , the commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the treaties , specifically with regard to articles 6 and 7 of the treaty on european union .    98.84811266653124
this principle means that the commission must act within the limits laid down by the treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 february was made .    84.60194878304792
can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it ?    136.88957712210998
as regards our external partners , all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to UNK their decision - making processes .    126.2976213305351
i interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields .    119.38299543420075
environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work .    171.95515760239863
it is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of eu directives .    60.224466559704716
if not , why not ?    44.20404532440623
the adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities , and does not require prior commission approval .    132.38493878302484
turning now to the question posed by mr alavanos , who i hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject , the commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor , during the preparation of the new programming period , the application of the partnership principle .    106.01530592247806
in the UNK papers all over greece : the ministry of public works concerning the structural fund : the minister ' s work ; the ministry of agriculture : the minister ' s work - just a few weeks before the elections - the ministry of telecommunications : the work of the minister for telecommunications ; the ministry of education : the work of the minister for education and a photograph of the minister ; the ministry of employment : the work of the minister for employment , a photograph of the minister and a photograph of the state secretary , and behind them all the symbols of the community support framework .    181.77185366452727
this is both propaganda by the party and propaganda by the candidates , financed by the european union , the csf .    97.1160008309258
would you let me have these documents so that i can read them , after i have had them translated ? i can then determine what they contain in terms of information and communication , which i can only welcome as the commissioner for regional policy , and what is propaganda .    163.06141520752547
subsequently , if i need to ensure that this partnership is disseminated and decentralised , then i will do this .    155.89987331280548
what role will aid from the structural funds play , on the other hand , in the promotion of renewable energy ?    86.3160977503947
in particular , would the commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of member states but also within member states , with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries ?    122.15363670387171
this question is very important and i would like to know - since this is a kind of ' baby fraud ' - whether the commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the andalusians , so that the funds which the european union are going to pay to andalusia , based on the census , will take into account these 400 000 children which aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services .    140.80172494257164
i know that these are very important issues in spain and there are differing viewpoints .    232.61114586546725
the more we talk about europe and what europe is doing for daily life , even when we disagree , the better this will be , provided that we talk about this objectively .    138.90306907017165
subject : new premises for the ohim at present the office for harmonisation in the internal market ( ohim ) is still operating from the same temporary premises , even though its new building was opened in june 1999 .    179.4989329292752
subject : alcohol monopoly and the internal market what action does the commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the state alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by sweden , and the associated import restrictions , and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied ?    86.89993777242084
my second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol .    66.34592618662275
can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in europe ?    118.33407448164287
my question would have been almost exactly the one raised by mr purvis , but i would like to press the point further .    168.1409937881286
granted , as you say , that excise duties lie within the prerogative of member states , nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the community UNK others might still conflict with the single market principle .    334.9907288963872
for example , if we take what mr purvis and i would be thinking of , the malt whisky producing parts of the highlands - a very peripheral part of europe , very hard - pressed , a whole farming community as well as a UNK community dependent upon it - a general practice of UNK the alcohol in scotch whisky , dutch UNK or danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine , seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the member states .    265.7155383360377
may i assure mr maccormick and other members of this parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between member states is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market .    98.81722198914257
we need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products .    146.4352588123704
however , it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations .    131.75556102466214
we share them with everyone on this earth .    91.46621839324375
if this cannot be adopted as the objective , then i am naturally prepared to support the proposal to the effect that we should have achieved levels very close to zero by the year 2020 .    77.8931878726867
mr president , commissioner , the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans , comprehensive information and hearing rights , and close cooperation between the member states , to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants .    129.90842016850885
i am aware , and the previous speaker highlighted this , that there are states in the european union that have problems with water .    89.28356263646434
commissioner , andalusia is not lapland .    51.40781119134925
but water is not free of charge , any more than houses or food are free of charge .    179.6894111441186
amendment no 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed .    161.1856088471439
the nitrates directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive .    131.214840760266
we are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals .    128.80859008633067
the commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality .    274.6068054843661
climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the european public and which have deserved considerable attention from this house .    169.68785000494083
in matters of the environment , investment and ambition come in a variety of forms , and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term .    132.627490687664
it is shocking in philosophical terms and dubious in legal terms for 100 % public money to be used to build up a heritage of private land ownership , even under cover of environmental protection .    148.02327730368532
result : a court action and repair costs greater than the cost of the programme itself .    108.17595973292713
what has happened over the past few days with the pollution of the danube and its tributary has been instructive .    58.456117248747745
like a number of previous speakers , i , too , wish to consider the economic problem and the problem of finding funding for projects , which , in my view , should be incorporated into the UNK domain .    119.54590418474967
i would therefore ask parliament and the commission to give the matter their full attention .    57.50970230050288
we propose a procedure like the luxembourg process .    58.576412265475334
this is not an option for us any more .    148.15515549534604
european citizens will not settle for any less than a quality of life which befits them as human beings .    177.7566920427395
macroeconomic policies , the stability pact and the criteria for nominal convergence have put a brake on modernising social protection which would improve the quality of people ' s lives , specifically by means of a significant increase in pensions and pension schemes , particularly of the minimum pensions , and through fighting social exclusion .    159.4190803639265
i am in favour of social protection , i am in favour of the original commission document , but i do not want to see people UNK out of jobs because social protection costs become UNK high .    49.92614978562237
until recently , the european countries fixed , it could be said in an UNK way , the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets .    177.10943180672703
in my humble opinion , it is the responsibility of all european , national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion .    153.71502256720387
mr president , i should like to congratulate mr andersson on his really excellent work , which is the reason why there is broader agreement , and i also thank the members of parliament involved for their contribution .    49.69496651045039
UNK are big business .    82.44188663771763
the future will show whether it is right , by means of this new parliamentary assembly , to reduce the commission ' s powers regarding these issues .    139.8454174949113
it creates international legal protection in connection with distribution , sale , rental , public reproduction and the making available of works .    169.11386831290977
it is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition .    73.28803081540285
parliament cannot change these details .    75.1979499946563
in the united states the wipo treaty has already entered into force , having been UNK into law by means of the digital millennium corporate act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the treaty by means of this legislation .    161.4152939659892
i would like to present the commission ' s conclusion to you without any further UNK : it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and , therefore , with ratification by this parliament .    80.90374781381254
this directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the wipo treaties .    88.35467922872692
i would like to add that the flight from amsterdam ' s UNK airport was also delayed and then cancelled .    137.81345710690812
i hope that next time , also if any other airline company is involved , things will run more smoothly .    272.2325935601135
( the minutes were approved )    9.610609973335848
the consequence of all this is a UNK of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets .    90.2404135207477
a serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged , which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments , which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies .    322.50429264353664
at the same time , however , there will have to be some changes in the framework within which those countries now receiving aid operate , particularly the need to fight corruption and to maintain democracy and good governance as fundamental principles in developing their political systems , together with a need to focus special attention on these countries ' own policies for reducing poverty .    126.55852545328179
the first such report was presented to the council in may 1999 , and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination , notably in the fields of peace building , food safety , fisheries and migration .    132.49583461323294
over the coming months , that is to say during the portuguese presidency , this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the commission has undertaken to present to us .    93.83949218497825
this procedure will be applied , not only in cases of corruption involving edf money , but also more widely in any country where the ec is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development .    176.8684771999091
this is a very important aspect , taking into account the UNK of public finances .    57.753457010070626
such a commitment entails an in - depth reform of procedures and implementation UNK on both sides .    134.1138986004264
human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage .    218.3121820440184
in the union , sugar is produced from sugar UNK .    76.01643367045864
this is why we need to set up inter - service task groups in the commission , in the council and in parliament which can police the UNK of coherence .    97.28947470964779
the crisis in last year ' s commission has been solved today , but the commission must now produce a policy in which we get full support for a coherent approach , which , no doubt , the entire parliament will soon demand in the resolution .    198.40102471538322
furthermore , the recent community budget cuts in this area , for the present financial year , are part of this trend , as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message .    195.81471757071535
they then drew the conclusion that population size should be reflected in the voting system and that the united kingdom would not surrender its veto .    166.62266538418947
how decisions are made is all - important .    79.66769921178195
much as i agree with the requirement to hold a debate on the coherence of different union policies and development policy , i question whether today is the time to be holding it .    74.5391432925989
however , this parliament wishes to add policies to aid development , agriculture , fisheries policy , immigration , our position in international financial institutions , the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform .    115.50452843724008
but we who sit here in parliament do not doubt for a second what the reason is .    233.44104062029047
in other words , there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries , including the eu countries , are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale .    97.13098760175102
if we want fair world trade we will have to gain acceptance for this principle during the next wto round of multilateral negotiations , because it would be contradictory if the european union imposed a rigid but fair discipline on itself , only for the united states and the other major powers to do the opposite and to take advantage of our restraint .    166.73342517793105
in the stance that we took at seattle , why such a silence on the eu ' s failure to implement the trade concessions for developing countries already agreed in the gatt , including for the crucial UNK sector ?    174.91123667788963
this fine balance must be struck in conjunction with the commission , and not by the commission on its own . in most countries where the commission is active , development aid is also granted by the member states themselves .    62.25357101986183
far too often , artificial UNK , veterinary UNK and a host of other items are provided to farmers free of charge .    224.76318989153606
for many years , i have tried , through the council and the commission , to find out why none of the institutions is actively participating in , and working for , conflict resolution in the western UNK , which is occupied by morocco .    174.62260722724457
we ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial UNK in africa to an end .    125.55845329091618
i can only hope that mr UNK will be successful in the forthcoming discussions within the commission .    178.03525538745765
there is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public UNK which would be a litmus test of the union ' s ability to match words with action .    157.88907747213275
are these UNK of the past , or will we find that in this relatively UNK and limited area the european union is still unable to meet its aspirations ?    136.68845737449945
nonetheless , these are important criteria for the european union .    148.00982272967175
what was mentioned concerning sugar in the caribbean is more complicated .    170.60605777694718
in the overseas countries and territories framework the accumulation of some of these trade aspects represents a complicated problem , but it may be that what we are talking about here has more to do with promoting the interests of some european companies than with generating income in the caribbean . in any case , this is a matter which we are currently dealing with .    120.95341065308855
the debate is closed .    26.64073523582921
the union will continue to play this role at the 56th session of the human rights commission to be held in geneva in march and april .    24.521185538853405
the united states of america will be tabling a draft resolution on china at the 56th session of the human rights commission and are putting pressure on the european union to support this draft resolution .    38.797783350353946
the european union is discussing issues on which it hopes that china will take concrete measures , and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the chinese authorities the message that the european union hopes china will announce positive measures at the session on 25 february .    155.49244691511444
. mr president , i would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for geneva on subjects like racism , civil and political rights and the right to development .    57.561668431688396
( parliament adopted the legislative resolution )    10.997013372273678
( applause from the left . heckling from the right )    93.36958263512258
as a political force , we serve to guarantee that austria will continue to embrace european values .    111.18240625094418
vote ( continuation )    80.72375967032204
that concludes the vote    61.41792729316828
what is interesting UNK this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie .    118.84005798927195
in my view , products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products , namely , those that can be seen and touched .    216.5731010839142
and , finally , the matter of the relationship between trips and wipo must be clarified . regarding this , too , there has been only silence by way of a response from the commission .    125.83367753495004
. ( fr ) we did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market .    142.40068246373482
in the last programming period 9 % of structural funds were available for community initiatives .    139.0289805380016
while there are some aspects of the report which i believe would be better dealt with in a different way , overall i believe the report offers a flexible and sensible approach and should be supported .    182.81179839429913
we have thrown water a life - belt .    231.95414784935554
it is essential to be aware of the widely varying situations in different member states , such as specific climatic conditions , water regimes and fluctuations in them over the year , the social , economic and ecological effects of applying standards , and also of the failure to do so .    117.01718349460663
on the contrary , i object to this systematically applied strategy .    55.46574504401695
.    42.41173274504656
. ( fr ) the current difficulties faced by our social security systems derive mainly from a shortage of income as the result of unemployment , poverty and an ageing population rather than from excessive spending .    229.53707570295248
the policies of the european union also have much to answer for in this situation .    85.40754335595346
social protection should be an expression , first and foremost , of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost , exclusively in fact , under the jurisdiction of the nation state .    107.19025456368625
in these areas , europe ' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity .    112.35672072105828
that is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the european union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see .    124.93723038996701
for us , it is important that the eu should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use .    93.69427804111315
equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our liberal agenda .    284.87016325037047
the role of parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on , particularly at the level of prevention .    88.55145917796602
we all know the picture .    75.0384987063547
here in the european parliament some of the members do not want the charter of rights , which is being discussed at the moment , to become enforceable in law .    49.00307344409394
that is positive .    61.73960689455138
the commission and the council will each have to decide for themselves what these might be .    83.95035289472155
these developments are encouraging but do not detract from the fact that the situation of human rights in the world remains very UNK .    179.80244212860887
control of the arms trade and improved media control are essential in this .    211.44631244652183
britain has re - opened its UNK in UNK .    205.80001121334547
the european union and its member states should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds .    45.899602461319986
mr president , this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual un human rights convention and the commission ' s and council ' s efforts in this respect .    148.86278898351208
it was a remarkable speech and i hope that mr gollnisch , who is no longer able to be with us , was able to hear that speech as well .    170.76392385951502
of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action , and the very first speech by mr salafranca mentioned two issues apart from geneva which represent actions , one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the european parliament on behalf of the european taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about eur 100 million that is spent through programmes , for which i am responsible , mainly going to non - governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation .    160.73819542233593
these discussions essentially cover four areas : security , the structure of government , territorial adjustments and issues relating to refugees and compensation , as a result of the situation following the partition of the island .    180.80276743841898
this unequivocal position on the part of the european parliament gave rise to a certain degree of controversy .    62.11667932593683
this is in line with the budget order issued by parliament in december last .    86.52044234783945
now is the time to devote our time and energy to UNK cypriots from both sides of the " green line " in finding a solution to a conflict which has lasted for far too long .    145.7764053143851
i hope this signals a new era of hope for cyprus .    141.25000263521932
it is UNK and contains UNK paragraphs , which is no way to set a UNK example .    112.36981181035087
it is not by chance that , immediately after helsinki , the turkish prime minister , UNK ecevit , stated that the cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974 .    192.68599611736605
the application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the cypriot economy , especially in agriculture . it entails the liquidation of the public sector , and it UNK and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in cyprus .    109.94700150586948
we should not be UNK these island peoples to cooperate in their own destruction , giving them money to absorb laws which are as UNK to their culture as a black hole is to mother earth .    175.48492343944295
the eu should leave cyprus and malta alone .    137.7439717953176
this means that we are all aware of the political dimension of the cyprus problem .    28.621664111527995
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , i would like to thank you all very much indeed for this debate , which all in all i have found to be encouraging and supportive , and it has also shown that there is a great deal of support in this house for the policy of the member states and that of the commission .    60.3482009477135
she ought perhaps to take some time to ask the erstwhile president - in - office of the council , who is not exactly a stranger to you , how this presumed lack of coherence has come about .    85.96468173997157
by way of clarification : if we transfer it across from heading 4 to heading 7 then this will have no effect on the overall balance of the budget .    210.22253051117195
i must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation , the one that has yet to be decided on here , before we can even get started .    80.90614147979652
on the contrary , i would say that , although many areas of european policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence , in this instance i would claim , on behalf of the commission and the council , that we have developed a very clear , transparent and coherent policy .    81.8196707756996
i would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us .    126.61117722319041
there was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me .    97.80684138659363
this kind of situation should not be allowed .    73.47165175010436
even babies born when due tend to be underdeveloped .    210.3074155277988
mrs karamanou , i recognise the fact that all the efforts that have been made in kosovo in this field have not been enough .    91.62271407813644
i do not think that any of us has the least doubt about that .    53.3631212838972
we are all aware of the difficulties , and particularly the financial difficulties , that mr kouchner is facing in setting up this administrative machinery , and , in particular , we are aware of the special difficulty involved in UNK police so as to ensure day - to - day public safety .    78.49788523521602
it is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation , and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of nato and the european union to take such action .    81.5135535040474
yugoslavia ' s crime was that it was the only balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of nato or of the european union .    228.41254824767515
i respect your understanding and knowledge of the balkan region , mr alyssandrakis , but i find it difficult , quite frankly , to understand how respecting the characteristics of the region can , in terms of political stability , be a solution to the problem .    144.73564054275712
what means will the charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes ?    12.216811469847048
i do not know whether these proposals will meet with a favourable reception or not .    125.33599673565456
so far there have been no infringements of the law .    97.855373348593
nevertheless , i would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these member states was actually a set of actions of what i would call preventive political action at diplomatic level . we feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which , although it has become part of a european union government , does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the union ' s aims .    178.1716219102821
what i would like to know is what will happen to the draft charter that the convention draws up ?    125.07061209980144
i would like to say that the council will only be able to respond to that part of your question in writing , at a later date .    55.44454928207759
question no 9 by ( h - UNK / 00 ) :    10.836226538123395
. ( pt ) in response to your question , mrs mckenna , i would first of all like to highlight the fact that the role of the court of auditors was laid down in the treaty establishing the european community .    27.98462719860939
mr president , i want to thank you for your answer . i want to ask a follow - up question which bears some resemblance to the one mr sjöstedt asked .    46.743791475879576
since the time allotted to questions to the council has elapsed , questions nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing .    34.27388094392066
we now face an historical challenge with multiple prospects for all the citizens of europe .    69.89905459000164
to summarise , perhaps what struck me most in your speech ; above all , you wished to remind us that , beyond its economic aspects , the task of constructing europe is a spiritual one .    213.55646786312684
i hope the number of members in this chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work .    91.59640040912457
i remember that at the last mid - term review , when i was rapporteur , the then commissioner UNK said that review would be the last .    144.49671176931975
we have had question times to the council and the commission and to the acp council , and i would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work .    71.26527602216997
i am delighted to see the result in zimbabwe .    41.784534107176746
all those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to namibia and south africa .    169.02733528089874
in the past , the representatives of the acp countries tended to be government members , government officials or ambassadors ; but today at least three quarters of the acp delegates are elected members of parliament .    149.1316940839118
yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the UNK winds of free trade without UNK their own domestic economy .    233.8647591986099
i do believe the acp countries need a transition period , but they also need support in the context of the new logic of UNK of aid , not only in agriculture and fisheries , but also in the exploitation of UNK and underground resources , some of which are being exploited , with slim economic returns to the acp countries themselves .    147.39926151116504
we are witnessing events of great political significance and i hope that we in the european parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the union , so that cuba ' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible .    99.20054244450478
first , it is important for cuba , to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the united states blockade , which has been repeatedly condemned by the european parliament and the united nations .    161.00672703833547
the debate on the stability pact , the debate on the UNK programme and the financing arrangements in the short term are all pending .    54.53032451963795
we are not UNK ourselves by believing that , once agreement is obtained , the mandate we are giving the commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long - suffering region , where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development .    224.30011224572763
a few days ago mr UNK announced that croatia ' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000 .    75.12517867141267
mr swoboda ' s well - balanced and laudable report fits in with this unexpected and delightful upshot on a very practical level .    309.8858042021956
please stop being so unpleasant and UNK cold water on everything .    140.11864807623036
so we must admit that developments in macedonia have followed surprisingly continuous democratic lines .    218.53759439747762
the council adopted on 24 january this year its negotiating directives for a stabilisation and association agreement with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia .    26.87262125408771
i look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking , i hope , the success of what we are trying to do in the balkans which , for me , remains the single most important litmus - test of what europe is able to do on its own doorstep .    157.71654489485155
from now on , the information will be provided by means of an electronic system called UNK , to which the european parliament will have access . this represents a real innovation , not only for us , but also - i am sure - for the commission .    89.38817825647472
finally , it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the european parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the treaties , and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an UNK that severely restricts the commission ' s executive power and may prejudice the european parliament ' s legislative powers .    153.58010839653505
for the rest , i warmly thank our rapporteur .    34.26862621332203
we are not seeking to UNK ourselves in implementing decisions , but it is a democratic safeguard that we should be able to do so on those few occasions when it really would be necessary .    88.76666756463433
we have been willing to UNK the provisions in that .    105.75125152975326
one is knowing how the committees operate , about their composition , agendas , descriptions , and so on , and the other is the right of scrutiny over actual decisions .    128.04741163014387
mr president , i am also pleased to welcome the spanish commissioner , mr solbes mira , whom i have congratulated more than once , inside and outside this parliament , on the excellent work he did in spain on the subject of european convergence .    129.20156365786502
it is good that the procedure exists .    46.68453908823943
that is of great importance in order to turn the emu into a success , now and in the future .    81.5431171675978
it is therefore important to include these currencies too in the section of the present programme of measures which deals with penal sanctions .    196.60542723770232
any country which began to make difficulties would incur a responsibility for the currency , and that country would be accountable , both UNK and economically , if its actions were to contribute to a delay .    232.32461818761394
the UNK of the euro are well known .    38.26912829230735
mr president , mrs cederschiöld , ladies and gentlemen , how safe is the euro ?    71.67527333616428
it has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law .    26.62848884917726
that is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use , a large amount ; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting .    115.68483976052589
the commission ' s proposal takes it as read that otc derivatives are not one of the general types of investment that ucits deal in , but that they should only be used to achieve efficient portfolio management and to hedge exchange - rate risks .    206.92095459324779
during the months that i have been working on this report , one very clear demand has emerged , both from industry and from those who represent the consumer .    130.91097564976351
as indicated by the rapporteur , we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this parliament .    55.886148993864104
not at all .    89.06958421208924
first , it UNK too far towards products based on UNK which have no bearing on the real economy ; derivatives which will help to swell the financial bubble which mr UNK referred to just now .    387.32823958935126
finally , we would urge members to vote in particular against amendment no 41 on capital requirements , because we feel that this would be very bad for the industry .    160.90820574239157
the aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors , which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro .    102.74659503853198
their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets , in which the principle of risk - spreading is taken into consideration , protected by appropriate supervision .    184.61706829834094
moreover , i have taken note of the request made by the committee on economic and monetary affairs to UNK the entire text , once it has been approved - amendment no 7 of the first proposal and amendment no 22 of the second proposal .    55.1670597240677
i therefore cannot see any reason why article 22 , paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason .    150.57557074885932
i would like to finish off by commenting on the remarks made by a few members this morning and , mr president , with your permission , i will do this in english .    49.29846611612689
mr president , international cooperation is certainly needed in order to tackle both cross - border crime and crimes which are committed in one state , but the evidence for which is to be found in another .    276.3528048837212
these are serious matters on which this house must act .    138.14540021399137
this is only the beginning of a great project in the field of law , which should advance hand in hand with the growth the type of europe we want to see .    76.67083581682225
the goal is , after all , to provide the judicial bodies - magistrates , in the first place , but also the citizens involved - with the instruments to fight crime without prejudice to the fundamental guarantees of defence and the general principles of human rights .    88.55847708690955
the present proposal is complex , because it deals with agreements between member states but has far - reaching consequences for the citizen - government relationship .    222.47492262741014
it is , therefore , conceivable that the european union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will UNK in the dust .    154.54573064922147
what is , on the other hand , absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the community , and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible , and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement .    112.5628587870221
mr president , confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level , the member states must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible .    165.05459997747747
firstly , these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and , to my mind , the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty , which have not been fully realised . this is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support .    205.160343788624
these are nevertheless minor flaws , which the rapporteur did not want and which - i hope - will be remedied when this chamber comes to vote .    227.0523293749264
neither the UNK nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence , a basic principle of international fundamental rights .    113.9728792183174
in that sense , the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important .    117.0481175324854
for that reason , in conclusion , i believe we should do something , particularly in the area of harmonisation of laws , not those relating to organised criminal activity , but those concerning punishable activities by the people which are more in the nature of social phenomena .    115.49551472821322
we must not forget that several tens of thousands of people are currently held in custody in the european union without having stood trial and that , in some states , custody is abused and used as a means of UNK UNK .    76.97319313309087
we can but thank the parliamentary committees , which have - via the introduction of numerous amendments - made far - reaching modifications aimed at providing guarantees to a report which , in its initial format , we did not find at all convincing .    290.26312487479845
as i have said , we need hard and fast rules if we are to have fair trials in europe - without UNK from interceptions , without the illicit use of video conferences - because we in europe should no longer have trials run by magistrates who play politics rather than UNK justice , and because punishment should be meted out to the real perpetrators of crime and not to innocent people who someone finds UNK .    195.603023851798
the draft that the council has UNK contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several members of parliament .    138.98926968362855
however , one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence .    215.70696456980912
this is what we have , and only practical experience will show us in detail if and where there are shortcomings and what additional steps will have to be taken .    149.29111202897002
among the steps to be taken will be the implementation of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the setting - up of the euro just project .    109.60089461865785
amendment no 83 in italian , which is the original version , states that ' UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK da una persona di UNK UNK o da un UNK o legale esterno ' .    172.50654447604126
we are a group of unity in diversity .    166.6061153927542
this clarification would certainly meet with our approval .    66.8618687792624
i believe that we , the parliament of the european union , who are the elected representatives of the citizens , must give UNK impetus to ensuring that the european union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens , including that of justice , and that of pensions .    85.00349978562116
it is patently clear that africa has become the forgotten continent .    142.57448190884904
the truth is that the european parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about europe , as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections .    89.96006212987281
the cooperation agreement with south africa is a prime example .    31.93763082768533
from the data which i am referring to today , it is evident that this disease is taking a disproportionate UNK on the developing countries least capable of responding to its wide - ranging impact .    196.67390538177884
it is incumbent on the european union and the united nations to address what is a social and fatal problem in a comprehensive and strategic manner .    66.72626851993621
which is why the new 20 - year agreement due to be signed in UNK on 31 may represents more than the simple renewal of the conventions regulating relations between europe and the acp .    261.6092240678167
there is still much to be done , however .    50.71064224161205
with the approval of this agreement , we have not achieved the final goal of transparency and democratic control where the comitology procedures are concerned . however , it constitutes real progress in the right direction , which is something we do not wish to obstruct .    126.06393093992051
this means that , when contemplating actions likely to lead to serious social consequences , job losses for example , companies should always actively search for and choose the least negative and least damaging solution .    146.19286601390806
in fact , the commission has argued for some time now that the rules we have established are not sufficient to deal with the challenges of today .    125.19930332430769
we thank you for that .    139.90082921468402
it appears that goodyear in italy received italian and european subsidies to the tune of approximately eur 40 million .    140.57538059819035
the first is to create new jobs for young people entering the labour market and the second is not to lose jobs .    121.28431211521152
yet again , workers are likely to lose their jobs .    144.01371902417176
the new company has announced its intention to initiate a restructuring plan with the aim of making savings .    178.12593888638898
i have received seven motions for resolution tabled pursuant to rule 37 ( 2 ) of the rules of procedure .    15.611412417603692
these events certainly have their origin in , among other factors , the absence of a clear immigration policy allowing the affected communities to live together respectfully and peacefully .    197.20753475130306
low wages , the lack of housing - some are living in cardboard UNK - the lack of access to social services and the de facto system of apartheid are UNK and unacceptable and are not worthy of the respect which every human being deserves .    239.60473321006705
three annual crops of moroccan and african workers support 100 000 people and manage to bring in an annual turnover of nearly eur 2 million ; and yet 60 % of them have no running water in a region where , as we know , the temperature may reach 40 degrees in summer .    157.79181416373535
yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments . outside the community arena , some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies .    140.0593234095166
those who organise illegal immigration should be prosecuted with the utmost vigour .    121.38562955869432
i doubt that any of you still believe that kosovo can one day become part of yugoslavia .    97.48761068849547
the police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on .    147.94987012879562
she might well have been abandoned by the large institutions , but we , who worked in kosovo and serbia for many years , are doing our utmost to campaign for her release .    136.3744629588681
the embargo on serbia must be lifted and serbia must , in turn , release its political prisoners .    193.5416590882666
there is not one truth in kosovo , there are several .    99.89042949875513
we have experienced this in our own national and european history . people can only enjoy lasting peace if they are living in a free and pluralist society where everyone is mutually tolerant .    262.5494660092737
the people of angola deserve better .    105.43355614041525
citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air - UNK UNK .    254.39229414071403
mr president , what sort of government hands over one of its own citizens to people whom it itself describes as ' terrorists ' and ' UNK ' ?    165.8976020027165
cambodia    71.97639256206413
the situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the treaty for an international criminal court has been UNK slow .    171.32932274753767
we support the efforts of unmik , kfor and the osce to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order .    165.59835510086643
danube environmental disaster    87.32566428365428
implementing high environmental standards will not only allow important industrial and technological sectors to develop , it will also have social and economic benefits and , at the same time , public health standards will improve .    189.21590256642065
we must demand that there should be no exceptions which could jeopardise people ' s health and the ecosystems .    123.64510804931092
we know full well that pollution and restoration costs run into billions .    100.18041252347206
moreover , it is all just words , because the socialist governments , which are now in a majority in europe , are just as incapable of taking action to prevent redundancies as right - wing governments .    268.7594454959823
the only way of stopping the UNK machine which produces capital gains on the one side and unemployment on the other is to ban redundancies in all large companies which are in profit , on pain of compulsory purchase , and to publish the accounts of large companies and subject them to the scrutiny of the workers and the general public .    240.69105544084678
in such cases , there is a measurable increase in employment as a result of the growth in tourist numbers , thus establishing a virtuous circle of growth in the local economy .    130.86662086343136
the new technologies also make it possible to open new markets in traditionally UNK , non tourist areas , which could develop to become centres of tourism and attract substantial investments .    186.209362957828
there is no legal basis , and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector .    73.98452987141046
we are all fully conscious of the importance of tourism , both to local economies and as a factor of european integration .    129.11906118737912
the resolution contains many excellent ideas for the promotion of different types of tourism and for its increasing professionalism .    104.79073124336269
it is obvious that mainly local and regional - and , therefore , to a lesser extent national - authorities are best placed to assess the situation and draft appropriate policy .    155.5278177087374
for this reason , i cannot therefore endorse the transfer of powers to european level .    96.29244615290517
first of all i should like to thank mr viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report .    29.5359469163656
europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy - making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position .    207.67367179128303
in the past , the commission had requested quantitative records of the losses incurred by companies because of such bankruptcies , so that it could form an opinion , and asked the european UNK of UNK - and - UNK owners and tourist agencies , UNK and UNK , to work out and draw up a regulation to govern the relations between them .    118.1887437685168
mr president , commissioner , the new attitude adopted recently by the commission on this important economic activity is striking to those of us who , in recent years , have kept an eye on tourism and its place in the community framework .    89.10713680517868
since the treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real community tourism policy , the european union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector , in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity , in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment .    68.31368893239514
what expectations does the commissioner have that the new intergovernmental conference which is starting will include this aspect ?    116.9601477771111
will the commission present new initiatives in order to see whether , through the constant efforts of the commission and parliament , we can gradually convince the council to do something on this issue ?    128.05339033552883
coordination of community tourism activities with other important issues such as regional policies , transport , employment , environment , culture and competition must strongly involve member states and the tourism industry itself .    227.77126963789723
the travel and tourism sector is the front - UNK in making use of ict tools .    234.62542166245768
this will dramatically change the way it operates .    87.59930777320635
in the autumn the commission will report back on the progress made in this respect .    60.137644216726756
tourism is also in the list of subjects which do not figure as new areas of competence for the eu .    232.65762427488963
i would like these words to be heard , because the european parliament cannot be UNK in this way in a crazy declaration which i consider to be totally unacceptable .    161.24842080764606
we take note and this will appear in the minutes .    165.2392894735203
i have the feeling they are just another compulsory exercise we have to perform .    188.17206563297887
however , such a strategy should come within the framework of environmental policy .    128.9895916937083
mr president , the commission ' s proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the commission and the fact that the new commission needs to re - examine the issues involved .    90.11589289004712
the role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole .    182.98001320492523
we are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more member states .    125.75903487189626
the process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement .    183.2208483782153
my conclusion is therefore : make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market , too .    153.31256077372905
it is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for .    159.2256092151299
most member states have been putting the UNK on , and i am pleased to note that , in my country , the new government has at long last completed something which should have been done a long time ago , and that the belgian postal services and the belgian government are now taking measures to ensure that the postal services are ready - at least partly ready - by 2003 to be able to stand up to the competition .    87.23325461571945
i would therefore ask you , commissioner , to help me in my task as a new member .    55.86418791776365
that is why today we are asking not to have any nasty UNK in the committee on regional policy , transport and tourism come monday .    78.42915225249828
i shall not repeat all the various statements he made at his hearing , i think we all still remember them .    187.3332000592221
mr stenmarck , sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other member states of the european union .    98.87637018599467
the two initial phases were not observed which , logically , ought to compromise the third .    95.38252890732468
do we have the results of this impact study ?    89.1280162513979
this is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service .    112.73889425883966
only last week , in the uk parliament at westminster the newly - elected mp from our european free alliance partners , UNK UNK , the party of wales , made his maiden speech on that subject .    216.51979549997924
such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote .    125.12532273751714
they are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs .    199.98827217055404
even the UNK village has a post office and in future e - commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e - mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means . that is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important .    217.33928004843872
this transparency is also very important for the unions , for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service ?    133.79941507220963
the postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout europe and not least in scotland .    138.47746001845528
in our opinion , the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted , including its timetable .    114.65577714437254
we should seize that opportunity , for the citizen keeps asking , why do we have europe ?    170.57104733606212
and here i want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - parliament and the commission must consider where to draw limits to competition .    142.11010194404685
mr president , liberalising postal services could increase competitiveness in the postal sector and guarantee cheaper and more flexible services for the public ; it could also address the challenges brought by modern technology .    222.79379886099338
i will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by commissioner bolkestein .    45.05380435035075
the implementation deadline for the member states is january 2003 .    135.92572598493373
it has assassinated the spokesman of the popular party in the town council of san UNK , UNK UNK .    181.66048745898567
thirdly , we denounce the extreme nature of an attack which , by being perpetrated against an elected representative of the people , not only violated human dignity and human rights but also showed absolute contempt for the will of these people .    253.74022493103686
you promised parliament you would raise this subject with the quaestors that very evening .    102.0503756907799
the treaties have been revised , new managerial tasks have been attributed by this parliament and by the council to the commission , and many other changes of great significance have occurred in our union , in our continent and in the world .    104.13864481291643
and when that assessment is complete , we will be able to establish whether the resources at our disposal are commensurate with the tasks attributed to us .    156.0162494434559
i do not use those as an excuse .    148.47961855958945
so far as the september communication is concerned , it is unprecedented .    163.94105505638876
as i said earlier , our ambition is total security for money and value for money .    57.63623540054978
we have had this discussion before and she knows i make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what i suppose we could call " hard law " .    165.377571411632
but , on this issue , i do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this house and in the council .    127.43719159294768
we are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering .    124.48768628915776
that needs to be addressed .    47.595742147339664
firstly , with regard to the decision - making bodies , the political and security committee met for the first time this morning , 1 march 2000 . this committee was established by the last general affairs council .    83.78541508403282
the first type will be operations in which european forces are involved within the framework of nato . the second will be operations involving european forces and directed by them , but using the means and infrastructure of nato .    183.95428540311983
the third will be operations in which the european forces act alone . in the first and second types we will need to cooperate with nato and must therefore establish a transparent , positive and confident relationship between ourselves and nato , as appropriate , which will be good for both the alliance and ourselves .    249.28968103949387
madam president , this brings me to the end of my speech .    80.71587065703523
i am delighted to be participating in the work of this house and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the commission . this work has one clear objective of allowing our european union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations .    147.89064720794323
i am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non - military operations and to introduce headline goals for non - military operations , together with a commission crisis centre .    74.68779687450844
what is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment .    136.1715431960514
you have spoken to mr gil - robles . i have received an e - mail from a former colleague , pierre UNK , who is in pristina at the moment .    97.86475226983114
i am in favour of a UNK policy against austria , but we shall then have a responsibility towards russia .    70.96461474713882
do you think that mr putin does not know that what he is doing in chechnya is not good ?    153.91857339966614
can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any state you care to mention , particularly those which , in their elections , do not ratify the policy adopted by the other member states of the union ?    167.798508864816
it cannot be restricted to a small number of countries , with others only being allowed to observe or UNK decisions " .    152.93022282569373
UNK only need five words for this : nothing about us without us !    146.4807969517066
indeed , we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective , in any case , the objective that i wish to achieve .    70.23241005558896
in this respect , as you will know , the european parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the community . this is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the member states but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination .    87.1312174238653
the flooding has been going for weeks , and yet only now it seems there is an assessment of need .    278.6535611018189
has any thought been given to the matter ?    99.86030755716814
and indeed , some member states are not geared for mobility .    57.791547441146136
we cannot leave it simply to governments .    92.56484900062908
meetings are all very well , but it is the result that counts .    71.44450044152391
if we translate this number into figures for the eu countries as a whole , which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place , we shall not have 60 000 men but , at best , 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003 .    154.75059919805307
the first period was a period of institutional change , change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional UNK in all the member states as a result of the fight by the women ' s movement , as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women .    112.56198890053155
this was followed by a second period , in which the worth of female models was recognised .    98.60137061165463
ladies and gentlemen , the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events : the first was the election of the president of finland , mrs UNK .    175.43293152101023
we in the commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the commissioners are working together , as can be seen from the reform of the commission , to achieve 40 % representation of women on all the committees of the european commission .    164.93902809182558
future generations of women must not be sidelined .    201.8004189588923
however , this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men .    176.23815014651478
moreover , i would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today .    112.36177796582719
i think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well , specifically that the new member states should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned .    161.63844842054837
we can learn from the successes mentioned , not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected , but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system .    216.0060416323462
irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class , race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work , it is nonetheless a fact that , in all areas of society , the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men ( albeit with a few individual exceptions , it is perhaps best to add ) .    299.7585779478631
it would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation .    198.91515335047626
therefore , commissioner , you can go ahead .    80.16895167961023
i would like to thank the minister and the commissioner for their speeches and for UNK themselves before the european parliament on the crucial matter we are discussing today .    60.51648403279515
however , it is also a question of political agendas .    108.55970242455966
that simply amounts to UNK their UNK .    102.94240104515583
the rate of employment in europe , which is much lower than in the united states and japan , must be increased .    57.83454223192416
mr president , why do women need their rightful share in political decision making ?    215.77191339475564
this discussion , which is being held in some parts of europe and here too under the french banner of UNK , touches the very core of democracy , and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman .    156.14750985608484
mr president , today ' s debate is devoted to the subject of the composition of decision - making bodies and changes to the decision - making system in europe .    67.20643390611048
the first is a policy of persuasion .    88.78354200823424
how do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded ?    141.50392839947685
my colleague poul nielson is literally on his way to mozambique this afternoon and evening together with the portuguese secretary of state to assess the situation on the ground .    244.272260612468
mr nielson will be happy to report back to parliament on the findings of his mission .    55.077292110215005
there is a risk , however , that all the effort that has been made in recent years , after all the problems with the peace agreements , with which we are all familiar , will have been wasted as a result of the natural forces that have been unleashed on mozambique over the last few weeks .    94.40351253857132
this immediate need will subsequently be replaced by a requirement for medicine to prevent epidemics , which have apparently already broken out , and aid for reconstruction .    240.72379893493346
the european commission responded in 1994 by setting up a disaster preparedness programme known as dipecho . this was intended to be proactive and , using a regional approach , to prevent disasters or at least to minimise their effects on the population .    145.74147102694303
it is as if the whole world is looking on , UNK .    107.06472119837575
mr president , ladies and gentlemen , there remains , however , one immediate problem : the need to provide help for all mozambicans who have been afflicted , many of whose lives are in danger , in their flooded villages , hoping that they will be UNK .    247.53388429261875
the commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with mozambique , as i have myself , and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake .    141.11772754194013
clearly also we need to see a massive UNK .    121.74476165958048
the debate is closed .    31.247242115653194
the report of the commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the european economy which it finds promising , especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8 % by the year 2001 .    156.124546040555
one is to adopt the commission ' s own excellent , outstanding UNK analysis , and ask the council to transform it into a programme of action involving certain interconnected UNK targets of levels of investment growth and employment that would make our commitment to a policy of full employment operational and credible .    148.52188485568897
however , we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the european internal market which still has some serious flaws .    95.73502770550304
there are still sectors such as air transport , energy and telecommunications in which , if we compare our unit cost with that of the usa or other countries which are equally competitive at international level , the cost supported by our companies is very high .    198.6862181827023
mr president , the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in mr katiforis , in my view , only served to call on the european parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people , social UNK and those living a precarious existence in our european union .    131.60057924401042
that is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them , despite our efforts , and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment .    74.04857466858766
there is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year UNK , by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions .    83.66748838250832
the vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the european commission , ecofin and the central bank , but also the european parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo - liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the member states of the european union .    96.59602361667521
our group categorically condemns this perception and , in this sense , does not intend to support this resolution .    113.02164339299247
even if he advocates sustainable growth , sustainability does not come into it .    121.05560816686
an appeal in favour of a more pro - active government policy comes across as very odd .    96.22584147271729
i am pleased that the debate we have been having here has been a tough one , for it underlines the fact that there are various approaches to economic policy .    122.03377456289716
the left - wing of this house does not want to continue along this path , rather it makes dramatic statements such as : what we need is state intervention , not the extension and consolidation of the market economy .    120.67234896276092
but beware of the UNK from the workers and the unemployed , who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but , on the contrary , are getting worse .    127.30437058000754
first , in respect to economic data , amendment no 2 makes two changes .    130.7302439512011
the other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue , subsidies , interest received , etc . , with a reference simply to volume of sales .    158.27476506788827
they have seen their own waters UNK by others while they have had to put up their own boats and UNK from fishing .    152.86594821157013
to this end , more extensive , compatible , uniform data is required , and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the union ' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted .    86.67328993148956
the time period will UNK on 31 may next , to be precise , when the commission will present a proposal .    139.21275867073527
wild salmon , UNK and UNK have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment .    336.2190606959364
this is a community policy which will effect ireland as well - where i am from - should similar unfortunate events occur .    126.63413921277912
had it been at that time , you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the eu a huge amount of money .    108.9529865412387
i look forward to parliament ' s own views on these amendments and will take careful note if you believe that such an approach is the best way forward .    107.42944755798449
this body was established back in march 1969 and is formally obliged to meet UNK , however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice .    204.1213894621042
this integration has always been a priority for me as we would be doing the fisheries and fishermen of the future a disservice if we did not emphasise the need for conservation of resources and responsible fisheries in general .    247.61112970670484
thank you very much , commissioner fischler .    28.913370700384014
whilst the communication reveals the commission ' s worthy intentions in this field , it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made .    303.0217570539441
our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which i tabled 14 , many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which i thank him sincerely .    204.18261114182602
according to these , for example , the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea .    208.21277217674577
mr president , mr katiforis ' s report has the virtue of having brought life , debate and controversy to a communication in which the european commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions , although recognising its inability to put these into practice .    193.57515408923214
mr katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which , in his opinion , could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea .    124.86457088972017
and just as well , in my view .    52.023354708112535
there is therefore a need for an in - depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment .    38.199940724104536
a lot of people are all in favour of it until it arrives on their own doorstep .    90.4115205778767
but at the end of the day one has got to strike the balance between those who are dependent on their life and their livelihood from the sea and those who are making the laws which govern who may or may not fish and where , when and how they may fish in any particular waters within the european union .    166.44596327363985
it does not matter whether you come from galicia , it does not matter whether you are from northern ireland or whether you are from scotland .    199.7597158916534
the second way is to recreate a law ex UNK , that is to say , to harmonise the systems and completely overhaul all the concepts and legal systems in each of the member states .    115.0238658888399
and i believe that it is our responsibility , in an ever more rapidly moving economy , where everyone must have a real opportunity , to give people the chance of running a commercial enterprise , and a second and a third chance , if necessary .    133.9303601070776
the commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the convention .    82.59151369674537
the 1995 convention , on the other hand , authorises the filing of secondary proceedings , thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the commission would like to see accepted .    135.44456113567082
a great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation .    108.432880558153
mr president , the reason why it is important to return to the subject of the oil slick , two and a half months after the wreck of the erika , is because the extent of the economic , social and ecological disaster affecting our atlantic coastline is , in fact , far greater than the first assessments gave us to understand .    73.02324168021421
some of them have already lost several years ' worth of UNK , but the 50 % to 80 % slump in sales is affecting all the harbours on the atlantic coastline , and even those in the channel and north sea .    270.96470013451085
